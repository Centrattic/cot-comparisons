  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about lying to his wife regarding his friendship with Liz. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a female coworker named Liz who started dating a girl. Liz later found out her girlfriend was lying and doing shady things. The author was texting Liz and talking to his wife about it. In the middle of the conversation, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and considering ending the relationship. The author told his wife that Liz loves her girlfriend and should end the relationship if she can't live without her. But his wife misinterpreted this as the author implying that Liz wants to have sex with him and that he was badmouthing her. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore, and he agreed but continued the friendship secretly.\n\nFast forward, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is angry. Now, the author is asking if he was wrong for not telling her he was still friends with Liz, or if the wife is the problem for going through his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and trust. The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued to do so. That's a lie. Hiding a friendship he promised not to have is a breach of trust. Even if the wife's actions (checking his phone) might be problematic, the author's initial lie is a significant issue. In a relationship, transparency and honesty are crucial. Lying about friendships, especially after a promise to stop, is a clear case of deception. While the wife's method of finding out (checking the phone) is invasive, the author's actions still constitute being in the wrong because he broke his word. The root problem is the dishonesty, not the wife's reaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
