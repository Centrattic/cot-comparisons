A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz after their initial argument. Even though they were just coworkers and the wife was acting out of jealousy, the author chose to continue texting Liz without telling his wife. That's a lie by omission, right? The wife specifically asked him not to be friends with Liz anymore, so he agreed but didn't follow through. \n\nThen, when the wife found out by checking his phone, he had to face the consequences. The question is whether he's at fault for not being honest. Honesty in relationships is usually a big deal. Even if the wife's action of checking the phone was wrong, the author's dishonesty is still a problem. He broke his promise, which led to the conflict. \n\nThe wife's anger might be influenced by her hormonal mood swings, but that doesn't make her right to snoop. However, the author's initial lie is a key point. Trust is important, and lying about maintaining a friendship that was supposedly cut off could damage that trust. \n\nSo, even though both sides have issues, the author's dishonesty is a significant factor here. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
