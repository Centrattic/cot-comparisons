A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. \n\nFirst, the situation starts with the author confiding in his wife about a coworker's texts. The coworker, Liz, is going through a breakup because her girlfriend lied to her. The author shares this info with his wife, but she misinterprets it, thinking he's having an affair. He tries to explain but she insists he cut off contact with Liz. He agrees not to be friends, but continues to interact with her at work. Later, his wife checks his phone and finds the texts, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author didn't actually end the friendship with Liz as he promised. That's a lie. \n2. The wife's reason for wanting to cut off Liz was based on a misunderstanding, but that doesn't make her wrong in her feelings. \n3. The author chose to lie instead of addressing the misunderstanding again. \n4. The wife invading privacy by checking his phone is also problematic, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he broke a promise he made to his wife. Even if the promise was based on a misunderstanding, he committed to not being friends and didn't follow through. That's a breach of trust. While the wife's actions (checking the phone) are also wrong, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. The lie is the central issue here. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong for lying. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe if the author had tried to explain again, but no, he just kept the friendship despite the promise. So yeah, he's in the wrong.\n"
