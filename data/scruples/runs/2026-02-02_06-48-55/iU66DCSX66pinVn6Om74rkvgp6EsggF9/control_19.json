A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz after their wife told them not to. The key points here are the original conversation with Liz, the wife's misunderstanding, the promise to stop being friends, and the subsequent lying.\n\nSo, the user was texting Liz, who was venting about her girlfriend. The user's response to Liz was meant to be supportive, but the wife misinterpreted it. The wife became upset and told the user not to be friends with Liz anymore. The user agreed but continued being friends anyway, which the wife found out by checking their phone.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling the truth about still being friends with Liz. From what I can see, the user made a promise to the wife to stop being friends with Liz, which they didn't fulfill. Even though the wife later checked the phone, the user's decision to lie might have been to avoid conflict. But lying in a relationship is generally seen as a problem because it breaches trust. \n\nThe wife's action of checking the phone is also questionable because it's an invasion of privacy. However, the user's lie is the initial issue here. They broke a promise and didn't be honest, which probably caused the wife's anger. So even if the wife overreacted, the user's dishonesty is their fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, meaning the user is in the wrong for lying. The wife's actions are also not good, but the user's dishonesty is the primary issue here.\n"
