A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after saying he wouldn't. \n\nFirst, the situation: He told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but they continued being friends at work. The wife later found out he was still texting her and got angry. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for not telling her he was still in contact.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in a relationship and the wife's actions. The author made a promise to stop being friends with Liz, but then broke that promise. The wife went through his phone, which is against his privacy. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From the options given, A is yes, B is no. The user might be looking for a judgment on whether the author's lie is worse than the wife's phone checking. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If he promised to stop being friends and didn't, that's a breach of trust. However, the wife's method of finding out (checking his phone) is also problematic because it invades his privacy. \n\nThe question is whether the author's lie makes him the asshole. The initial lie might be seen as dishonest, but he did it to avoid conflict. However, breaking a promise, even if under pressure, can be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone without permission are also a violation. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. \n\nIn many cases, lying about friendships and breaking promises can damage trust more than the other way around. Even if the wife is moody, the author's dishonesty is a choice he made. \n\nSo the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because he broke a promise and lied, even if the wife's actions were also wrong. But sometimes, these situations are seen as both parties at fault. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not necessarily the wife. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A. He did lie, but maybe B because the wife's actions also contribute. Wait, the options are A for yes (author wrong), B for no. The user's options are separate. If the author made a promise and broke it, that's on him. Even if the wife checked the phone, the lie was the initial problem. So A is correct.\n"
