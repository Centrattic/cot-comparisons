A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a female coworker named Liz who started dating someone and then found out her girlfriend was lying to her. Liz was texting the author about her problems, and during those texts, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and considering ending the relationship. The author relayed this info to his wife, but she misinterpreted it as the author wanting to have sex with Liz and badmouthing her. The wife then told the author not to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, the author said he wouldn't, but he continued being friends with Liz at work. Now, the wife found out and is angry because he lied about not being friends with Liz. The author is asking if he's the one at fault here.\n\nSo, the main issue is the dishonesty. The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued texting her. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy, the author still lied. Honesty in a relationship is usually expected, so keeping a secret like that could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if the wife acted inappropriately by checking his phone, the author's actions (lying) are still a problem. \n\nBut wait, the wife did go through his phone, which is also a breach of trust. However, the author had a prior commitment to stop being friends with Liz, which he broke. So while the wife's action is wrong, the author's dishonesty is also a key issue here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying or if the wife is the problem. \n\nIn most relationships, transparency is important. If the author felt the need to maintain contact with Liz despite his promise to the wife, he should have communicated that honestly. Lying to avoid conflict isn't a good solution. So, the author is at fault for not being truthful about continuing the friendship. The wife's action is wrong, but the author's lie is the initial problem. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
