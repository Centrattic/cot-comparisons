A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was close to a female coworker, Liz, who was in a relationship that turned out to be problematic. The author discussed Liz's issues with his wife, which led to his wife feeling betrayed and cutting off Liz. The author then lied to his wife, saying they weren't friends anymore, but continued to interact with Liz at work. When the wife found out by checking his phone, she's upset. The author is now asking if he's at fault.\n\nBreaking it down: The key points here are deception and trust. The author made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz, but continued the friendship behind her back. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) were wrong, the author's lie is a major issue. Trust is foundational in a relationship, and breaking that promise can cause significant harm. \n\nPossible defenses: The author might argue that he was trying to maintain a friendship and didn't want to escalate the situation. Also, the wife's decision to check his phone is a privacy violation. However, lying is generally considered a breach of trust regardless of the context. \n\nThe wife's perspective: She felt betrayed by the author's continued contact, which could make her feel disrespected. Even if her method of checking the phone was wrong, the underlying issue is the author's dishonesty. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Yes, because he lied about something significant that his wife had asked him to stop. The lie undermines trust, which is crucial in a relationship. The wife's actions are also problematic, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer is A.\n"
