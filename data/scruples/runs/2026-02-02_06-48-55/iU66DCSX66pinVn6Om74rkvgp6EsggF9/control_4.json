A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the husband was texting Liz when she was in a troubled relationship. He shared this with his wife, but his wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking he was being disloyal. To appease her, he told her he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore. But in reality, they stayed friends at work, and now the wife found out and is upset. The key points here are the initial lie to the wife and the wife's actions of checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband was wrong to lie about his friendship with Liz. From a relationship ethics perspective, honesty is usually valued. Even if the wife was acting out due to her mood, the husband chose deception over transparency. This could erode trust in the long run. Also, maintaining a friendship that the wife is uncomfortable with, especially when there was a prior misunderstanding, might not be the best move. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone without permission, which is a privacy violation. However, the husband's lie is still a breach of trust. Even if the wife's actions were wrong, the husband's dishonesty is a separate issue. In relationships, honesty is a cornerstone. By not being truthful, he's contributing to the problem. The wife's reaction, while inappropriate, is a consequence of his initial lie. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A because the husband is in the wrong for lying, even though the wife's actions were also wrong. The core issue here is the dishonesty on his part.\n"
