A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife found out he was still texting Liz after he promised to stop. He says he lied because he wanted to appease her, but they stayed friends at work. The wife then went through his phone to find out the truth. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, or if the wife is the TAA (That Asshole).\n\nLooking at the author's actions: He made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz, but he continued to text her. That's a lie. Even if he did it to keep the peace, lying to a spouse about their relationships can be a big deal. Trust is important in a marriage, and breaking a promise like that can harm that trust. Plus, the fact that he didn't correct the misunderstanding about Liz's texts to him\u2014like Liz was actually questioning her relationship, not being interested in him\u2014might have contributed to the wife's jealousy. But the main issue here is the lie about continuing the friendship.\n\nOn the wife's side, she acted out by going through his phone. That's definitely not a good approach. Privacy is a mutual respect issue, and snooping is a breach of that. However, her reaction led to the truth coming out, which is why the author is being challenged. So, while her method was wrong, her anger might have been justified because she was lied to. \n\nThe author's excuse of \"I didn't want to fight\" or \"I wanted to appease her\" doesn't really justify the lie. Promises in a relationship require honesty, even if the situation is uncomfortable. The author should have been honest about maintaining a friendship, perhaps explaining that they just work together, but he didn't. That's a breach of trust.\n\nThe wife's moodiness might be a factor, but that doesn't excuse the author's actions. It's possible she overreacted, but the root cause was the lie. So, the author is in the wrong for lying, even if the wife's response was also wrong. The key here is the initial act of deception versus the discovery method. In relationships, honesty is usually the better path, even if it's hard. So the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
