She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong for making their girlfriend start paying some bills after a single incident. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple lives together, with the author paying all the bills because they work full-time and the girlfriend is part-time. The incident involves a $40 takeout where the author asked the girlfriend to pay, leading to her upset reaction. The author is now considering making her contribute more to the bills as a matter of principle.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the existing financial arrangement and the reaction to a minor incident. The author has been okay with paying everything until now. The girlfriend's part-time job might mean her income is lower, so expecting her to start paying bills might be a sudden shift without prior discussion. \n\nThe author is upset not just about the $40 but the girlfriend's attitude. However, the incident is minor, and using it as a catalyst to change financial responsibilities without considering the girlfriend's situation could be problematic. The author might be overreacting to a small event, especially since the girlfriend's income is limited. \n\nFinancial expectations in a relationship should ideally be discussed and agreed upon. The author hasn't mentioned any prior conversations about splitting costs. Jumping to asking for contributions after a single incident, especially one over a small amount, might be unfair. The principle of fairness is important, but so is understanding each other's contributions and communication.\n\nSo, the author's decision to make the girlfriend start paying bills based on this incident might be seen as unjust. It's possible the author is projecting their own feelings of being taken for granted onto the situation without considering the girlfriend's perspective and financial constraints. The correct approach would be to have an open conversation about financial responsibilities rather than making a unilateral decision based on a minor disagreement.\n"
