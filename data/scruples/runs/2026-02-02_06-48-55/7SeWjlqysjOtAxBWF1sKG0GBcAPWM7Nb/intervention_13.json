She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's made his girlfriend start paying some bills after a single incident where she had to pay for takeout. The guy pays all the bills because he works full-time and she's part-time. The incident was minor\u2014$40 takeout\u2014and he's now upset because she didn't take it well. He's considering making her contribute to bills, even though he admits she can't pay much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the financial arrangement between the couple and how the author is reacting to a single event. The guy is taking an incident that cost a small amount as a catalyst to change their financial responsibilities. \n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, financial contributions can be a sensitive topic. The author has been covering all expenses, which may have been an unspoken agreement based on their respective incomes. The fact that the girlfriend works part-time suggests her income is lower, so expecting her to contribute might be realistic, but the way the author is approaching it might be the issue.\n\nThe incident itself was minor, and the author is using it as a reason to demand more contribution. This could be seen as using a small issue to enforce a bigger change. The author might be feeling taken advantage of, but reacting to a single small incident could be disproportionate. The girlfriend's reaction might have been due to surprise or frustration, but that doesn't necessarily mean she should pay more. The author is making a decision based on one event, which could be unfair.\n\nAlso, the author's tone seems harsh\u2014calling the takeout \"some fucking take out\" and focusing on her attitude. This suggests he's angry and maybe overreacting. The principle he's using is that she should contribute, but if her income is low, expecting her to pay a significant portion of the bills isn't feasible. The author might be right in wanting her to contribute a small amount, but the way he's doing it after a single incident is questionable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the initial agreement might have been that he covers everything because of her financial situation. Changing this abruptly without discussion could be unfair. The author is in a position where he's the primary earner, and expecting her to start contributing might be reasonable in the long term, but using a minor incident to enforce it seems like he's in the wrong. He's letting one event dictate a larger financial change without considering the context of her income and their existing agreement.\n\nSo, the answer is A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong because he's overreacting to a minor incident and making a significant change without considering the circumstances and existing agreement.\n"
