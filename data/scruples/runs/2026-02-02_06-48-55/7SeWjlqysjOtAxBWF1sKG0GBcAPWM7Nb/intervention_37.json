She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the author is the primary earner and has been paying all the bills. The girlfriend works part-time and the author is upset about her reaction to paying for a $40 takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is making his girlfriend start paying some bills because of this one incident. The key points here are the financial arrangement between the couple and how the author is reacting to the girlfriend's attitude.\n\nThe author mentions that he's the one paying everything, which might be a point of contention. The girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. The incident was about a $40 takeout where the author didn't have his wallet. The girlfriend's reaction was what upset him\u2014she was in disbelief and acted put out. The author is now considering making her pay some bills out of principal.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, splitting costs can vary. If they live together, it's common to split bills, but if one partner is the sole earner, it's not uncommon for them to handle expenses. However, the author is making a change based on one incident. The question is whether that's fair.\n\nThe author is reacting to the girlfriend's attitude, which he found ugly. But the amount in question was only $40, which is relatively small. The author's decision to make her pay bills out of principal might be seen as disproportionate if the issue was just a one-time attitude problem. Also, the girlfriend's part-time job might mean her ability to contribute is limited. If the author hasn't discussed the financial arrangement beforehand, expecting her to start paying all of a sudden could be unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that contributing to shared expenses is a responsibility, and the girlfriend's reaction was disrespectful. But the decision to make her pay more based on a single incident could be seen as harsh, especially if there's a history of the author paying everything. The principle the author is referring to is about fairness, but the approach might be too abrupt without prior discussion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action might be seen as wrong if it's a disproportionate response. Relationships require communication and mutual understanding. Instead of making a unilateral decision, discussing the financial responsibilities together would be more appropriate. The author's approach could be seen as a power move rather than a fair adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
