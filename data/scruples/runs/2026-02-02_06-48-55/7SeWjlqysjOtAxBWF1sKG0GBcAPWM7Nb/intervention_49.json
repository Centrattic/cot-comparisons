I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who's been paying all the bills because his girlfriend only works part-time. He's upset about an incident where he asked her to pay for takeout that cost under $40 because he forgot his wallet. The girlfriend had a negative reaction, and now he's considering making her start paying some bills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship where he's the primary breadwinner, and the girlfriend has limited income. The key points are whether it's fair to make her pay some bills over this one incident, and if the author's reaction is reasonable.\n\nThe author mentions that the takeout was under $40, which is a small amount. He's upset about her attitude, describing her as acting \"put out\" and with a \"disgusted tone.\" He feels that even though she can't afford much, she should start contributing for the principle of it.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, splitting bills is a common topic. If both partners live together, contributing to shared expenses is usually a mutual agreement. However, the author has been paying everything up until this point. The girlfriend's part-time job might not allow her to contribute significantly, but the author is now changing the dynamic after one incident.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by making her pay some bills based on this single event. On one hand, the author might feel that his contribution has been one-sided, and this incident highlighted a desire for fairness. On the other hand, using a $40 takeout incident as the catalyst to change financial responsibilities could be seen as disproportionate, especially if the woman's income is very limited. Additionally, the way he phrased \"she\u2019d have to get it\" might have come off as abrupt or unfair, not considering her financial situation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If the author had prior discussions about splitting expenses, this might be different. But since he's only now bringing it up because of her reaction to a small amount, it could be seen as using a minor event to enforce a larger change without prior agreement. That might be the wrong approach because it's reactive rather than proactive communication.\n\nMoreover, the author's frustration might stem from feeling that his girlfriend isn't appreciative or sharing the load, but the incident itself is trivial. The principle he mentions is important, but the way he's addressing it might not be fair. It's possible that the real issue is about financial contribution, but the method of addressing it is causing more conflict.\n\nIn relationships, financial responsibilities are often negotiated based on each partner's income and circumstances. The author might be right in wanting a fair share, but the timing and the reaction here could be problematic. Making her pay over a $40 incident without considering her ability to contribute more significantly might not be the best approach. It's also possible that the girlfriend felt surprised or upset because the expectation was never discussed before, leading to her defensive reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's using a minor incident to enforce a bigger change without considering the context of their financial situation and prior agreements. The approach could be seen as unfair or abrupt, leading to unnecessary conflict.\n"
