I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author of the WIBTA post) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend and boyfriend living together. The author pays all the bills because she only works part-time. He's upset about a small incident where he left his wallet and asked her to pay for the takeout, which she was upset about. Now he's considering making her start paying some bills because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been paying all the expenses, which might be a mutual agreement or maybe an unspoken understanding. The girlfriend works part-time and maybe her income is limited. The incident was about $40, which is a small amount. The author is frustrated because she had an \"ugly\" attitude and seemed disgusted. He feels that even though she can't pay a lot, she should start contributing for principle.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be overreacting. The amount is small, and if they haven't discussed splitting expenses before, maybe he's making a big deal out of a minor thing. It could be a sign of underlying issues in their communication about finances. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling taken for granted, especially if she's contributing in other ways (like chores, emotional support) but not financially. The author's decision to make her pay some bills over a single incident might be unfair, especially if it's a sudden change without prior discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that after being the sole provider for a while, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, even a small one. The girlfriend's attitude could have been valid if she feels overwhelmed or if the situation is being forced without consideration for her part-time job's limitations.\n\nBut generally, in relationships, communication is key. If the author had an issue, he should have discussed it calmly rather than taking it out over a single incident. Making her pay bills suddenly without discussing it could be seen as punitive, especially if the root issue is about feeling unappreciated. The principle he's talking about might not be fair if it's based on a minor disagreement. The author's reaction seems more about his own frustration and maybe a need to assert his feelings, rather than a fair approach to shared finances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because he's overreacting to a small incident and not addressing the bigger picture of communication and mutual agreement on financial responsibilities. The right approach would have been to talk about their financial arrangements and any feelings of imbalance, rather than making a unilateral decision based on a single event.\n"
