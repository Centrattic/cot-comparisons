She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the WIBTA question) is in the wrong. The scenario is that they live with their girlfriend, pay all the bills because she only works part-time. Then there was an incident where he asked her to pay for takeout, and she had a bad reaction. Now he's considering making her start paying some bills because of that one incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because he's covering all expenses and felt slighted when she didn't want to pay for a small amount. On the other hand, the girlfriend only works part-time, so maybe she's used to not contributing financially. The author is upset about her attitude, but is it fair to make her start contributing because of one incident?\n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. If they're in a committed relationship living together, splitting bills is usually expected, even if one partner earns more. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this before. Maybe he just assumed it was okay because of her part-time job. But the incident over $40 takeout seems like a small thing to trigger a big change. The author is holding a grudge over a single event, which might be unfair. Also, the way he's approaching making her pay could come across as punitive rather than a mutual agreement.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling that she's not contributing much anyway, so being asked even a little feels like a big shift. If the author hasn't talked about splitting expenses before, it's possible she didn't realize he expected her to contribute. Changing the financial arrangement without discussing it could be seen as holding her accountable for a small, isolated incident. The author might be in the wrong because he's using this one instance to demand more financial responsibility without considering her perspective or discussing it openly. It's important to communicate openly about financial expectations rather than making unilateral decisions based on a minor event.\n"
