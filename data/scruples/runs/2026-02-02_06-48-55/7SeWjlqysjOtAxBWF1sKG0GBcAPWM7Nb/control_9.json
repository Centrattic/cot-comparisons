She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting bills with their girlfriend. They live together, he pays all the rent and bills because she only works part-time. The issue started when he left his wallet and asked her to pay for takeout, which was under $40. She reacted negatively, and now he's considering making her start contributing to the bills, even though it's just one incident.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is frustrated because he's been handling all the expenses and feels taken for granted. The girlfriend only works part-time, so maybe her income is limited. The key points here are communication, financial responsibilities in a relationship, and whether one incident justifies changing the entire arrangement.\n\nThe author's argument is that the girlfriend should contribute in principle, not necessarily because she can afford a lot. But is it fair to make her start paying all the bills over a single $40 incident? The takeout was a small amount, and the girlfriend might not have expected to contribute to that. Maybe the author's resentment has been building up because he's been shouldering all the costs, and this incident was the trigger.\n\nHowever, changing the financial arrangement after one incident might be abrupt and unfair, especially if the girlfriend can't afford to contribute much. Relationships require communication and understanding. The author might need to talk to her about his feelings instead of making unilateral decisions. Also, expecting her to pay all the bills if she only works part-time could be unrealistic without discussing it first.\n\nSo, the author is in a position where he's upset about not being appreciated, but his response might be overreacting. The right approach would be to have an open conversation about financial expectations and find a solution that works for both, rather than punishing her for one incident. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and for making a drastic change based on a minor event.\n"
