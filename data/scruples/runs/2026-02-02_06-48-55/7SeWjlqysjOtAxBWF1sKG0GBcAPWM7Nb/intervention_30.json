She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person in the relationship) is in the wrong for making their girlfriend start paying some bills over a single incident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend live together. The author pays all the bills because the girlfriend works part-time. The issue started when the author forgot their wallet, asked the girlfriend to pay for $40 takeout, and she reacted negatively. Now the author is upset and wants her to start contributing more.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has been handling all expenses, the girlfriend's part-time income might not cover much, and the triggering event was a small amount of money. The author is considering making the girlfriend pay some bills because of this incident.\n\nI should consider relationship dynamics. In a partnership, financial responsibilities are often shared, but it can vary based on income. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially if the girlfriend isn't contributing. However, the reaction to a single $40 incident seems a bit harsh. Maybe the author is using this as a catalyst to change the financial arrangement, but is that justified?\n\nAlso, the author's frustration about the girlfriend's attitude is valid. If the girlfriend was dismissive or uncooperative, that's a point. But the author's response\u2014making her pay more because of one incident\u2014might not be fair. The girlfriend's part-time job might not allow her to contribute significantly, so expecting her to take on more bills could be unrealistic without prior discussion.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships often requires communication. The author might need to talk about expectations rather than using a minor incident as leverage. Jumping from one incident to splitting bills could lead to resentment. The author might be right to feel that the girlfriend should contribute, but the approach is problematic because it's based on a single event and not a mutual agreement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for making a significant change in financial responsibility over a small incident without discussing it beforehand. It's unfair to the girlfriend to suddenly expect her to pay more because of a one-time situation, especially when her financial capability is limited.\n"
