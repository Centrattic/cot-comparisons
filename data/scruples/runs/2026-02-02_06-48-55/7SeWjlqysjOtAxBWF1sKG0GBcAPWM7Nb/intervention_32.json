She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author and their girlfriend live together, he pays all the bills because she only works part-time. Then, there was an incident where he forgot his wallet and asked her to pay for takeout under $40. She had a negative reaction, which upset him, and now he's considering making her pay some bills out of principle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been covering all expenses, which might be a point of contention. The girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. When he asked her to pay for the takeout, her reaction was unexpected and negative. He's now thinking about making her start contributing, even though he acknowledges she can't pay much.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, maybe. He's using a single incident to make a significant change in their financial arrangement. That seems a bit harsh. The takeout was a small amount, and her reaction, while maybe rude, doesn't necessarily justify the author feeling the need to shift all financial responsibilities immediately. Relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of reacting to one incident, he might have had a conversation about splitting bills based on their combined incomes. For example, if he makes $2000 a month and she makes $500, maybe she contributes 25% towards shared expenses. But because of one situation where he forgot his wallet, he's now considering making her pay out of principal. That seems more about his hurt feelings than a practical approach. He might be projecting his own frustration onto the situation, not considering her perspective. She might feel taken for granted if he's always paying everything, so maybe this incident is a symptom of a larger issue. The author's approach of making her pay some bills due to a small, isolated event could be seen as unfair, especially if there hasn't been prior discussion about shared financial responsibilities. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because he's overreacting to a minor incident and not addressing the underlying issue through communication rather than punishment.\n"
