She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is considering making their girlfriend start paying some bills after a single incident where she was upset about paying for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is paying all the bills because the girlfriend works part-time. They mention that the girlfriend's reaction to paying for a $40 takeout was unpleasant. The author feels that after this incident, they want her to start contributing more, even if it's just in principle.\n\nI should consider if the author is right to expect her to contribute. Maybe the author hasn't discussed this before, and suddenly expecting payment after one incident could be unfair. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially since she's working part-time and maybe her income is limited. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach of making her pay after a single event might be hasty. \n\nAlso, the way the author frames the situation\u2014\"her attitude was ugly\"\u2014might indicate some level of projection or misunderstanding. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling taken for granted if she's used to the author handling all expenses. The author might be overreacting to a minor issue, using it as a catalyst to change the financial arrangement without considering her perspective.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship should ideally be discussed and agreed upon mutually. The author's unilateral decision to make her start paying, especially after one incident, might not be fair. It could lead to resentment on her part if she feels it's an overreaction. The key here is communication. If the author wanted her to contribute more, they should have discussed it before this incident rather than using a small disagreement as leverage.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the financial expectations beforehand and for making a unilateral decision based on a single incident. They should have had an open conversation about splitting costs, considering her financial situation. The incident with the takeout might be a symptom of larger unaddressed issues rather than the root cause.\n"
