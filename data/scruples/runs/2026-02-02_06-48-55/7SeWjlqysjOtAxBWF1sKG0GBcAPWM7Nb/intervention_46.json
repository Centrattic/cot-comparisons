She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting bills after a small incident with takeout.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend (gf) works part-time and they pay all the bills. The issue arose when the author asked their gf to pay for a $40 takeout because they forgot their wallet. The gf had a negative reaction, which upset the author. Now, the author wonders if they should make the gf start paying some bills despite her limited income.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the financial arrangement in their relationship and the reaction of the gf. The author is frustrated that they cover everything and feels the gf should contribute, even if it's a small amount. But the incident was minor, and the gf's reaction might have been due to stress or feeling taken advantage of.\n\nI should consider if the author's response is proportional. The author is considering making the gf pay bills over a single $40 incident. The gf's part-time job might not provide enough income to cover her share without hardship. The author's frustration might be valid in terms of wanting fairness, but the approach could be seen as unfair if it's overreacting to a small issue and not considering the gf's financial situation.\n\nAlso, the way the author reacted\u2014making a big deal about a small amount\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be using this incident as a way to shift financial responsibility regardless of the gf's ability to pay. That could be the wrong approach. Relationships require communication and understanding, so maybe the author should have discussed sharing expenses more gradually rather than using a minor incident as a catalyst.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're overreacting to a minor issue and not considering the gf's financial limitations. The solution should involve a more balanced approach rather than using a single incident to demand financial contributions.\n"
