She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" question is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting bills after an incident where the author made his girlfriend pay for takeout because he forgot his wallet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple lives together; he pays all the bills while she works part-time. The issue arose after a small expense where she had a negative reaction. The author feels she should start contributing more, even if it's just for principle.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The key points are the financial arrangement and the emotional response. The author is upset about a $40 takeout order that he made her pay for. He's using this as a reason to make her take on more financial responsibility. But is this fair?\n\nOn one hand, if they live together, splitting expenses can be a sensitive topic. The author might feel that since she works part-time, she should contribute even if it's not a large amount. However, he's making her pay this $40 as a reaction to her attitude, which he describes as \"ugly\" and \"disgusted.\" This suggests that her reaction might have been out of surprise or frustration rather than entitlement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has been paying all bills up to now. The incident was a small, one-time occurrence. Using this as a catalyst to change the financial arrangement might be disproportionate. The author's frustration could stem from feeling taken advantage of, but if he never discussed finances before, he might have set up an unfair dynamic where the girlfriend isn't expecting to contribute, leading to her surprise and perhaps a defensive reaction.\n\nAlso, the author's approach seems to be demanding change based on a single incident, which might not be a mature way to handle financial discussions in a relationship. Open communication about shared expenses is generally more effective than using a minor incident as leverage.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's reacting to a minor event with a significant demand for change without prior discussion. His frustration is valid, but the approach could be seen as unfair or harsh. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to not expecting to contribute yet, which wasn't communicated. Therefore, the author's decision to make her start paying some bills over this one incident could be considered unjustified.\n"
