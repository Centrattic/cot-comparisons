She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the author (probably a guy) pays all the bills because his girlfriend only works part-time. Then, there was an incident where he asked her to pay for takeout (under $40) because he left his wallet, and she had a negative reaction. Now he's considering making her start paying some bills because of this one incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author pays everything, and the girlfriend works part-time. The incident was a small amount of money, but the author is upset about her reaction. He feels she should start contributing more, even though he acknowledges she can't pay a lot. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, expecting someone to suddenly take on financial responsibilities after a single incident might be unfair. The girlfriend's job is part-time, so her income is limited. The takeout was a small amount, and her reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed. The author's resentment could be built up over time, not just because of this one event. It's possible he didn't communicate his expectations before, and now he's holding a minor incident to justify a bigger change. Also, splitting bills isn't always about equal amounts; it can be based on income. If the author has been paying everything because he earns more, maybe that's been the arrangement. Sudden changes without discussion might cause more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the girlfriend isn't contributing enough, even in small ways. If he's been covering all expenses, maybe he's feeling taken for granted. However, using a single incident to justify a significant shift in responsibilities could be seen as unfair. The problem might be about underlying issues rather than just that one takeout instance.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's reacting to a single event without considering the girlfriend's financial situation and without prior communication. He's making a big decision (making her pay bills) based on a minor issue, which could be seen as unfair. The right approach would be to discuss finances openly and find a fair arrangement based on both incomes, rather than a one-time incident.\n"
