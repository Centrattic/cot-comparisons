She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their girlfriend to start paying some bills after a single incident. The context is that they live together, he pays all the bills because she's part-time. The incident was a $40 takeout where she was upset he asked her to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, and he's covering all expenses. That's a big commitment. The key point here is whether the author is justified in making her pay some bills now because of this one incident. \n\nThe author mentions he never had an issue before, but this incident made him reconsider. The girlfriend's reaction was negative, maybe because she's used to not contributing. The author feels she should contribute for principle, even if she can't pay much. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, splitting bills is usually expected in a shared living situation. However, the author has taken on all expenses up to now, possibly because she's part-time. The question is whether one incident is a valid reason to change the financial arrangement. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that even a small contribution would be fair. But is it fair to make her pay after just one incident? The problem is that the issue is about principle. The author might be feeling taken advantage of, thinking that if she's not paying anything, it's unfair. However, the incident itself was a small amount, and her reaction might have been due to surprise or feeling that the responsibility was being shifted suddenly. \n\nOn the other hand, expecting contribution might be reasonable, especially if they're in a long-term relationship. But is it wrong to hold her accountable after just this one instance? The author's frustration is about the principle, not the money. So, is the author in the wrong for making her pay because of a single event, or is he justified in wanting a fairer split?\n\nI think the key here is that the author is reacting to a perceived imbalance. He's been covering everything, and the incident made him realize he wants her to contribute. However, using one incident as the trigger might be abrupt. The girlfriend might not be expecting this sudden change, which could be unfair to her. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's making her pay based on a single incident without discussing it beforehand. Relationships require communication, and this seems like a situation where a conversation about expectations would be better than sudden changes.\n"
