She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He pays all the bills because she's only working part-time. There was an incident where he left his wallet and asked her to pay for takeout, which she did with a bad attitude. Now he's considering making her start paying some bills because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been covering all expenses, which is a lot, and the girlfriend works part-time, so maybe her income is limited. The takeout was a small amount, but the author is upset because of her reaction. He feels she should start contributing more, even if it's a small amount, just in principle.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be stressed about her own financial situation. If she's only making a little, maybe she's using all her income for her own expenses. The author's demand might be coming from a place of frustration, but is it fair? The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing a valid concern about fairness in the relationship. It's reasonable to want equal contribution, especially when finances are involved. However, his approach might be abrupt. Instead of making her pay more immediately after a single incident, maybe a discussion about shared responsibilities would have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the approach. Since the author is advocating for a fair share, even if the method could be improved, he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend's reaction was negative, but the author's intention is to promote mutual responsibility. So, the answer is B.\n"
