She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting the bills after a disagreement over a $40 takeout. The author (WIBTA) is the boyfriend who pays all the bills and now wants his girlfriend to start contributing, especially after she got upset about paying for the takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the financial arrangement and the emotional response. The author pays all the bills, and the girlfriend works part-time. The inciting incident was the takeout where the author asked her to pay, and she reacted negatively. The author is now considering making her pay some bills as a principle matter.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, in a shared living situation, splitting expenses is common. Even if one person earns more, contributing a bit helps build teamwork and mutual respect. The author might be overreacting to a single incident. The $40 takeout is a minor expense, and the girlfriend's reaction might have been due to feeling taken advantage of, especially if she's in a lower-paying job. The author's frustration is valid, but making her pay bills over one event could be seen as punitive. It's important to communicate and find a balanced approach rather than using this as a reason to change the arrangement suddenly. The author might not have considered the girlfriend's financial constraints and feelings, which could mean he's in the wrong.\n"
