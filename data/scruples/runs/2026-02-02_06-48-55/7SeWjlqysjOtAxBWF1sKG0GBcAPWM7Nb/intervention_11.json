She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the author is paying all the bills because his girlfriend only works part-time. The conflict arises after a small incident where the author asked his girlfriend to pay for takeout because he forgot his wallet. The author is now considering making her pay some bills as a result of this incident. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author has been paying all the bills until this incident. The girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. The takeout was under $40, which is a small amount. The author is upset about her reaction and wants her to start contributing more, even though she earns less.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations in a relationship. The author is holding a minor incident as justification for changing the financial arrangement. But is the author overreacting? The fact that it's a single, small event might indicate that the author's main issue isn't the actual incident but an underlying frustration about her not contributing financially. However, the author's decision to make her pay more bills based on one incident could be seen as unfair, especially since her income is limited. It's possible that the author is projecting his own feelings of being taken for granted onto her, and using this incident as a catalyst to enforce a change he might already be considering. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be feeling that because the author has been paying everything, it's expected that he would cover small expenses. Her reaction might have been due to surprise or frustration, which the author interpreted as being \"ugly.\" The author might not have considered that she might feel the arrangement is already unfair or that she's contributing in other ways. However, the author's main argument is about principle, wanting her to carry more weight financially, even if she can't pay a lot.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be making an assumption about her ability or willingness to contribute without discussing it. Using a single incident to justify a change in the financial arrangement without considering the broader context of their relationship dynamics could be problematic. The author's reaction might stem from deeper insecurities or unmet expectations, rather than the incident itself. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's using a minor event to enforce a larger change without addressing the underlying issues or having an open conversation with his partner.\n"
