She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting bills between a girlfriend and her partner. The author is upset because his girlfriend didn't pay for takeout costing under $40, even though he pays all the bills. He's considering making her pay some bills because of this incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. The author pays all the rent and bills, which might be a financial burden for her. The incident about the takeout seems minor, but it's causing resentment. The author is focusing on principle, wanting her to contribute even if she can't cover much.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, expecting someone to contribute even a small amount might be reasonable, especially if it's a shared living situation. But the trigger here was a small expense, and the author is overreacting. The key points: the takeout was under $40, and the author already covers all major expenses. The girlfriend's reaction might have been due to feeling taken advantage of, even if unintentionally. The author's approach of making her pay more after this single incident might be unfair, especially since her income is limited. It could lead to more conflict. Maybe the author should have communicated his feelings about splitting expenses earlier instead of using a minor incident as a catalyst. So, the author is possibly in the wrong because he's overreacting to a small issue and not considering her financial situation. The answer would be A.\n"
