She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's been paying all the bills because his girlfriend only works part-time. Then, when he forgets his wallet and asks her to pay for takeout under $40, she reacts negatively. The author is now considering making her start paying some bills, even over just this one incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been handling all the financial responsibilities, which might have led to an imbalance. The girlfriend works part-time, so maybe her income is limited. The takeout was a small amount, but the author is upset about her attitude. He's thinking of making her contribute for \"principle\" reasons, even if she can't handle a lot of the bills.\n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual support and communication. If the author never discussed splitting bills before, expecting her to take on financial responsibility suddenly after one incident might be unfair. The fact that she works part-time suggests her ability to contribute might be limited, especially if she has her own expenses. His anger over a $40 takeout could be disproportionate, especially if it's just one instance. The key here is whether his reaction is justified. The girlfriend's response might have been a valid expression of frustration if she felt taken for granted, especially if she wasn't expecting to contribute. The author might be reacting out of hurt pride rather than a fair assessment of her capabilities. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"just out of principle\" is telling. It sounds like he's more upset about the principle of her not contributing rather than the actual financial impact. This could indicate an issue with his perception of fairness in the relationship. He should have had an open conversation about financial expectations from the start. Using one incident to justify a sudden change in responsibility might not consider her circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is right that relationships should involve shared responsibilities, and it's reasonable to expect some contribution. But the way he's approaching it\u2014because of one incident and possibly without prior discussion\u2014might be the problem. The wrongness here hinges on whether his action is a fair, communicated adjustment or a reactionary, possibly unfair move based on a single event.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's reaction seems to be more about his own feelings of being undervalued than a proportionate response to the situation. Without prior discussion, making her pay bills over a minor incident could be seen as unfair. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
