She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the guy pays all the bills because his girlfriend works part-time. There was an incident where he asked her to pay for takeout, which cost under $40, and she reacted negatively. Now he's considering making her pay more, even if it's just a principle thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is the primary earner, paying all the bills. The girlfriend works part-time, so her income is limited. The takeout was a small amount, and he expects her to contribute now because of her reaction. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI should think about whether it's fair to hold a single incident over someone's head, especially when there's a significant income disparity. The guy never had an issue before this, so maybe he's reacting more to her attitude than the actual money. The girlfriend might feel unfairly treated if she's already contributing in other ways but isn't expected to pay a large share. Also, expecting her to pay for small things when her income is low could be unreasonable. The author's motivation is partly about principle, but maybe he should consider their financial situation and communication. The main issue here is whether the reaction is proportionate and fair given their circumstances. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's overreacting to a single small incident and not considering her financial limitations.\n"
