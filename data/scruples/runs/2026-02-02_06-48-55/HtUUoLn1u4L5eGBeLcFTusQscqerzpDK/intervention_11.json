My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, making them uncomfortable. They also have plans to have another child and a free room. The wife wants her mother to move in, arguing about loneliness and that assisted living is bad. The author explains they don't want to lose their home's comfort and mentions their wife's past behavior towards the author's own mother, which might affect their decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and living alone, which raises concerns about her well-being. The wife's perspective is that supporting her mother's move is compassionate. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish if it's about personal discomfort over the mother-in-law's needs.\n\nBut the author also has valid reasons: the home's space for a future child, past experiences with the wife's difficult behavior towards his mother, and the stress of living with a judgmental person. The key here is whether not accommodating the move is an unreasonable choice given their circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged based on fairness, empathy, and considering all perspectives. The author is being honest about their limitations and future needs. However, the mother-in-law's well-being is a factor. But the author isn't ignoring her entirely; they suggested alternatives like assisted living, which the wife rejected. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision seems based on their own family's needs and comfort, which is a personal choice. They aren't necessarily selfish but prioritizing their household's stability. However, maybe there's a middle ground they could explore. But according to the question, the answer is either A or B. Given that the author is standing their ground with valid reasons and not completely dismissing the mother-in-law's situation (they offered alternatives), I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The key is whether the refusal is without valid reason. Since they have valid reasons and alternatives, they are justified.\n"
