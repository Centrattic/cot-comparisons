My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it. He says the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about his own comfort in the home. The wife accuses him of being selfish. The author has also mentioned that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, even not allowing them to stay with her and instead making them get a hotel. He feels like this makes his decision stronger, even though he's not trying to be unkind.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern. The wife's perspective is that her mother is lonely and should live with family. But the author has valid reasons: the mother-in-law is hard to be around, and they plan to have another child, so space is an issue. The author also points out that his wife isn't supportive of his family, which he's using as context for his decision.\n\nLegally and ethically, can someone be forced to take in a family member? Probably not. It's a personal decision. The author is being honest about his feelings. The wife's criticism of his lack of compassion might be valid if he's not offering alternatives. But he suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law refuses. So he's trying to find a solution, but she doesn't agree with it.\n\nThe author's discomfort in his own home is important. If living with his mother-in-law would make him unhappy, that's a personal right. However, there's the aspect of family support. The wife might feel neglected or that her mother isn't being cared for. But the author's stance isn't about neglect; it's about the dynamic between them.\n\nAlso, the wife's treatment of his mother adds another layer. If she's not allowing them to stay, maybe that's part of why the author is hesitant to take her mother in. It could be seen as a bit of a trade-off, but the author says it's not a \"tit for tat,\" so he's not directly blaming her for his decision. He's using it to justify his resolve.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't obligated to take in his mother-in-law if it's causing him significant distress. He's trying to find a middle ground (assisted living) but it's not working. His personal comfort and the future plans for another child are valid considerations. The wife's perspective is about family support, but the author is making a personal boundary. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's being honest about his limitations and considering alternatives. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
