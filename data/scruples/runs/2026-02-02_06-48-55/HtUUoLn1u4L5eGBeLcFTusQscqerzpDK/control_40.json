My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in, but the author is uncomfortable because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author has a valid concern about their living space and potential future child. They also mention that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to his stress. \n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning. He's being honest about his feelings towards the mother-in-law, which is understandable. He's also considering practical aspects like having another child. However, the wife feels it's selfish, and there's a conflict over assisted living. The author's stance is about maintaining comfort in his home, which is a legitimate perspective. \n\nBut I need to consider if refusing is seen as inconsiderate. The mother-in-law is his wife's parent, so there's an expectation sometimes in families to support each other's parents. However, the author has a right to his own comfort and space. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might justify his hesitation. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own living conditions over a family member's request? It's a balance between compassion and personal boundaries. The author isn't refusing entirely, he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living, even if that wasn't well-received. \n\nSo, the answer likely depends on cultural and personal values. Since the author is upfront and has valid reasons, including future family planning, I think he's not in the wrong. The wife's perspective is also valid, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer would be B.\n"
