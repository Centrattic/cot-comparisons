My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. They had a heated discussion, and the author suggested assisted living, which upset the wife. Also, the author notes that the wife is unkind to his own mother, which adds context.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about autonomy and family dynamics. The author's home is a shared space, so both he and his wife should have a say. However, the wife's perspective is about caring for an elderly parent, which is a valid concern. The author's reasons are personal discomfort, which is also a personal right. But is refusing to accommodate the mother-in-law selfish?\n\nI need to consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, adult children are expected to care for elderly parents. However, others prioritize the well-being of their immediate family. The author's argument is that the mother-in-law's presence would make him uncomfortable, affecting his home life. On the other hand, the wife feels neglected and the mother-in-law feels rejected.\n\nThe author's wife also has a strained relationship with his mother, which complicates things. The author might be trying to protect his own relationships. But is that a valid reason to deny his wife's request? It's a balance between personal comfort and family responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the author's suggestion of assisted living was met with resistance. Assisted living can be a good alternative, but the mother-in-law feels it's too harsh. The author's stance here might be seen as not considering the mother-in-law's feelings enough.\n\nBut ultimately, the home is a shared space, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The wife's needs and the mother-in-law's needs must be weighed against the author's well-being. Since the author is clear about his reasons and has proposed alternatives (even if they were rejected), it's a matter of mutual respect and compromise.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions involve compromise. The author isn't being entirely unreasonable, but his refusal without considering the wife's feelings might contribute to the conflict. However, he isn't obligated to sacrifice his own comfort entirely. So, it's a nuanced situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
