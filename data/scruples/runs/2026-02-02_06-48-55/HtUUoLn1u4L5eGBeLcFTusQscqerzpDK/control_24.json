My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. Hmm. So the situation is that the mother-in-law is alone and in her 70s. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and there was some back and forth. The author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mom, which adds some context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being accused of selfishness by his wife for not allowing her mom to move in. But the author has valid concerns about the mother-in-law's personality. It's about the balance between compassion and personal boundaries. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they're standing up for their own comfort and the home they share. They mention that the mother-in-law is hard to handle, so it's not just about not wanting her there, but actually having a reason to avoid conflict. Also, the mention of future plans for another child suggests that space is a factor. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as selfish because the mother-in-law is lonely and could be cared for in their home. But the author is also considering alternatives like assisted living, which the wife rejects. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might make the author feel justified in their stance. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to accommodate someone if it's going to cause significant stress. The author is being upfront and respectful, so maybe that's not selfish but rather setting healthy boundaries. The wife's reaction might be overly harsh, especially since the author is also considering the future family. \n\nAlso, the part where the wife didn't allow them to stay with the author's mom and refuses to mend that relationship could imply that she's not exactly a peacemaker in family matters. That might make the author's resolve stronger. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their needs and considering the well-being of their household. The wife's perspective is valid, but the author's reasons are justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
