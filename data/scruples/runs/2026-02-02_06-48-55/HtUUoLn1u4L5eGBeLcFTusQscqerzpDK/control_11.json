My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they have a free room but also plan to have another child. The wife is making the author feel selfish and even brought up assisted living, which the mother-in-law strongly opposed.\n\nThe author argues that the home is their joint property, so they should have a say. They also mention that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, which adds to the complexity. The key points here are autonomy over one's home, the difficulty of the mother-in-law's personality, and the future plans for another child.\n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law's situation is concerning\u2014she's elderly and alone. The wife's push to have her move in could be out of genuine concern. However, the author has valid reasons: the mother-in-law's behavior, the home's future use, and the existing tension with the wife's treatment of his mother. The author isn't being cruel; they're prioritizing their household's well-being. \n\nIt's important to consider that while family support is valuable, no one should be forced to live with someone they find unbearable. Assisted living is a possible alternative, but the mother-in-law's strong opposition complicates that. The author's stance isn't about lack of compassion but about personal boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their own living space and emotional well-being, especially given the challenging dynamics. The wife's actions might be more at fault here for not respecting the author's perspective.\n"
