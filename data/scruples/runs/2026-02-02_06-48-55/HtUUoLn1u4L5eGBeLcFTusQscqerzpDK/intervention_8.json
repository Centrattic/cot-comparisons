My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is elderly and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but doesn't think he can handle living with her. The conversation got ugly, and the wife accused him of being selfish. The author also points out that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which he says strengthens his resolve. He's planning to have another child, so they need the room. The wife thinks assisted living is like prison and that the author is being uncompassionate.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is standing up for his own well-being and his family's needs. He's not denying that his mother-in-law is lonely, but he's honest about his limitations. It's his home too, and he has a right to feel comfortable. The wife's behavior towards his mother might indicate she's not putting effort into family relationships, which the author is aware of. The author is trying to find a solution that works for everyone, suggesting assisted living, even though the wife rejects that idea.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between personal comfort and family responsibility. The author's stance might be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's mother's well-being. But he's also considering future family plans (another child), which is reasonable. The wife's actions (not staying with his mother) might suggest a lack of effort, which could shift some responsibility.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's being honest about his feelings and trying to find alternatives. He's not forced to take in his mother-in-law if it's not feasible. The wife's approach seems to be putting pressure on him, which is unfair. The author is maintaining boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should consider if there's a cultural or expectation angle where adult children are expected to care for their parents. However, the story doesn't indicate that the author is neglecting his wife's needs or refusing all help. He's suggesting alternatives. So, probably B.\n"
