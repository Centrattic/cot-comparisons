My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about not letting his mother-in-law move in is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. The wife's reaction was that he's selfish and he suggested assisted living, which she dismissed. Also, the author mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to his resolve.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in. He's concerned about his own well-being and the potential strain on their household, especially with plans for another child. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for her mother to come, possibly out of loneliness and a sense of duty.\n\nNow, I need to weigh the ethical aspects. Is the author being selfish by not considering his wife's needs? Or is he justified in protecting his own mental health and family dynamics? Assisted living was suggested, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea, which complicates things. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might make the author feel vindicated in his stance.\n\nCultural factors could play a role here too. In some cultures, family care is expected, but the author might come from a different background. The question is whether his refusal is a valid reason or if he's overstepping by not accommodating his wife's wishes without compromise.\n\nThe author argues that the home is his as much as hers, so he should be comfortable. This is a common argument in shared living situations. However, the wife's feelings of loneliness and her mother's need for care are also important. The author's past interactions with his mother-in-law (being difficult and judgmental) are his reasons for resistance.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer. If she's being unkind, maybe the author's stance is about protecting his own family's dynamics. But does that absolve him of a responsibility to care for his mother-in-law?\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to have a parent-in-law live with you unless there's a specific legal agreement or cultural expectation. The author isn't legally bound here. The main issue is the social and emotional aspects. The wife might feel betrayed, but the author is prioritizing his own well-being and family planning.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has valid concerns about his mental health and family planning. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014being upfront but not offering alternatives that the wife might accept\u2014could be seen as dismissive. But given the mother-in-law's personality and the wife's own behavior towards his mother, the author's decision might be more about self-preservation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he has legitimate reasons for his decision, and there's no legal or moral obligation to take in a parent-in-law unless agreed upon mutually. His concerns about family dynamics and potential stress are valid.\n"
