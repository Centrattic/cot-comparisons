My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The story is about someone declining their mother-in-law moving in with them. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which the author acknowledges might be a reason to consider her. The wife wants her mother to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they tried to be respectful but feel that even a little of her is too much. They also mention that a free room is available but they plan to have another child, which could complicate things. The mother-in-law perceives this as selfish, and the author suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. Additionally, the author notes that the wife is not kind to his own mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for an opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons: personal comfort, the mother-in-law's personality, and future family plans. On the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and may need support, and the wife feels the author isn't showing compassion.\n\nThe key here is whether refusing to have the mother-in-law move in makes the author selfish or if their reasons are justified. The author is being upfront about their feelings, which is important. They also suggest alternatives like assisted living, which shows they're considering options for the mother-in-law's well-being. However, the mother-in-law rejects that, so the author is left in a tough spot. The wife's own behavior towards the author's mother might also influence the dynamic, but the author isn't the one being unkind to their own mother.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions require balancing multiple considerations. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and future family planning, which is reasonable. It's not necessarily about right or wrong but about differing priorities. The mother-in-law's loneliness is a valid concern, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their comfort for it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision based on their own circumstances and the challenges of living with someone difficult. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
