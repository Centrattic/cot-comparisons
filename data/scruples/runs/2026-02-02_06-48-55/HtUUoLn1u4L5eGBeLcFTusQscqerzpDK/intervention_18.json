My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer explains that their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They mention that they tried to be respectful but that living with her would be hard. The wife is pushing for her mom to move in, citing loneliness, but the writer is concerned about future plans for another child and the living space. They also mention that the wife is unkind to the writer's own mother and refuses to even visit her, which adds tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and lives alone. The wife feels her mother is lonely and wants her to live with them. The writer's suggestion of assisted living was met with resistance from the wife, who sees it as worse than prison. The writer argues that it's their home too and they should feel comfortable.\n\nI need to weigh the writer's right to their home and comfort against the mother-in-law's needs. The writer isn't being cruel but is firm in their decision, which is understandable given the mother-in-law's personality. However, the wife's behavior towards the writer's own mother complicates things. If the wife is unkind, it might affect the family dynamics, but that doesn't necessarily mean the writer is wrong to prioritize their own living situation.\n\nThe key points are the mother-in-law's difficulty, the writer's valid concerns about space and future children, and the wife's lack of effort in family relations. The writer isn't forcing the mother-in-law into assisted living against her will; they offered alternatives but the wife rejected them. The writer's stance seems reasonable, especially since it's their home too. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the writer is justifying their decision based on valid personal reasons without being cruel.\n"
