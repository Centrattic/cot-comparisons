My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author doesn't want his mother-in-law to live with them. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author feels the MIL is difficult and judgmental. He mentions they have a free room but plan to have another child, which complicates things. The MIL is upset and thinks assisted living is like prison. Also, the wife is not kind to his own mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe author argues that it's his home, and he should be comfortable. The wife, on the other hand, seems to be pushing for the MIL to move in, which the author is resisting. \n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. So I need to weigh both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's explaining his reasons: the MIL is hard to be around, and they have space issues due to planning another child. He's also concerned about his own comfort in his home. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her mother is lonely and needs family support, especially since she's in her 70s. The author's wife isn't helping by being unkind to his mother, which might add to the conflict.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about his decision to not let the MIL move in. The author is being honest about his feelings, which could be seen as selfish by the wife. However, he's also considering practical aspects like space and the potential for another child. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to set boundaries in their homes, especially if they anticipate that someone else's presence could cause stress or discomfort. That being said, there's a cultural expectation sometimes that adult children should care for their parents, which the wife might be invoking. \n\nThe author's wife's behavior towards his mother is another factor. If she's not making an effort to repair that relationship, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault for prioritizing his own family's well-being. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more empathetic or explored alternatives, like assisted living, even if he decided against it. However, he did suggest that and the MIL rejected it. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. The author is defending his home and his comfort, which is valid. But there's also the aspect of family support and responsibility towards aging parents. However, the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother complicates things. \n\nI think the author's reasons are legitimate. He's not wrong for wanting to maintain his home environment. The answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
