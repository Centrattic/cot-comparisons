My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the person (the author) is at fault for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and there was a big argument. The author suggested assisted living, which the wife rejected. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, refusing to stay with her and not trying to repair that relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. On one hand, the author is standing up for his own comfort and the home he shares with his wife. He has valid concerns about the mother-in-law's behavior. On the other hand, the wife feels her mother's needs are being ignored, and maybe the author isn't showing enough compassion. But the wife's behavior towards the author's mother complicates things. She's not making an effort there either, which might affect the dynamics.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to his own living space, the wife's demands, the mother-in-law's situation, and the wife's treatment of the author's mother. The author isn't being cruel; he's being honest about his limits. The wife's refusal to consider the author's perspective and her own lack of effort with his mother might make the situation more about her than him. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's balancing his own well-being with his wife's wishes. Since the wife isn't compromising and is being dismissive, the author's stance seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B, No.\n"
