My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife is upset, thinking the author is selfish. The author mentions they have a room, but they're planning to have another child. They suggested assisted living, but the wife rejected that idea. Also, the wife has a poor relationship with the author's mother and isn't making efforts to fix it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has valid concerns about their own comfort and the potential stress of living with a difficult relative. They also mention future family plans with another child, which is a practical consideration. On the other hand, the wife is concerned about her mother's well-being and wants her to live with family instead of assisted living. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting their wife's needs and her mother's situation.\n\nBut then there's the part about the wife's behavior towards the author's own mother. The wife didn't even want to stay with the author's mom and insisted on a hotel. The author feels that the wife isn't making an effort with her in-law, which might add to the tension. The author justifies their stance by saying it's their home too and they need to be comfortable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting the wife's wishes and the mother-in-law's needs versus the author's own boundaries. The author isn't being cruel, considering alternatives like assisted living. However, the wife's perspective is that family should take care of each other, and the author's refusal might be seen as selfish in that context. But the author's past experiences with the wife's inconsiderate behavior towards his mother might make his stance more understandable. \n\nI think it's a tricky situation. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and family's future, but they might need to find a middle ground. However, if the wife's feelings are hurt and the author is dismissive, that could be a problem. The key is communication and mutual understanding. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for empathy on both sides. So I'm leaning towards answer B, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
