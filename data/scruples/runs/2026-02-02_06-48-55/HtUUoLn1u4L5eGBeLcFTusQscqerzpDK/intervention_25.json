My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The writer explains that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, and his wife wants her to move in. But the writer feels the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about having another child and a free room. The wife is upset and accused him of being selfish. The writer also mentions that the wife is unkind to his own mother, which strengthens his resolve.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are the writer's reasons: he's concerned about the mother-in-law's personality affecting their home environment, future family planning, and his own comfort. The wife's perspective is that the mother-in-law deserves family support and that assisted living is a bad option. \n\nIs the writer being selfish? Well, he's standing up for his own family's well-being. It's reasonable for him to consider the impact of another person living with them, especially if the mother-in-law is difficult. The wife's refusal to engage with his mother might affect his decision to prioritize his own comfort. \n\nBut on the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, and the wife feels it's important to provide support. However, the writer isn't obligated to have her live with them. The decision is a personal one, and he has valid concerns. The wife's criticism of him as selfish might be harsh, especially if he's trying to balance family needs. \n\nThe writer is not in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his family's circumstances. While the situation is sensitive, he's not violating any rights; it's about mutual agreement and respecting boundaries. The wife's approach might be more self-centered, pushing for her mother without considering the husband's perspective. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
