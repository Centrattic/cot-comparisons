My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a concern for her well-being. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. However, the author feels that living with her would be difficult because she's judgmental and difficult. He also mentions that his wife is unkind to his own mother, which adds tension.\n\nThe author argues that he's being upfront about his reasons and that he suggested alternatives like assisted living. The mother-in-law and wife are upset, feeling he's selfish. The key points here are the right to privacy and comfort in one's home versus the responsibility to care for a family member. \n\nThe user needs to decide if the author's refusal is justified. Factors to consider: the mother-in-law's needs, the potential strain on the couple's relationship, the suggestion of alternatives, and the existing family dynamics where the wife is unkind to the author's mother. \n\nThe author's stance is about maintaining his own comfort and home environment. While there's a responsibility to consider the mother-in-law's well-being, the author isn't the one primarily responsible for her care, especially given the wife's behavior towards his mother. The answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is seen as selfish or a reasonable boundary.\n"
