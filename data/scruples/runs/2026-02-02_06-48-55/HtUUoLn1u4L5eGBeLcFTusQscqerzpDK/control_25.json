My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nThe user's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been talking about her loneliness, and the author anticipated she wanted to move in. He was upfront about not wanting her to move in because she's difficult and judgmental. The wife argued that they have a free room and that assisted living is like prison. The author mentions that the wife is also unkind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay during a visit. He says it's not a tit-for-tat but that he needs to feel comfortable in his home.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The main factors here are the family dynamics, the author's valid concerns, and the wife's demands. The author is concerned about his own comfort and the potential stress of living with his mother-in-law. He's being honest about his feelings, which is important. On the other hand, the wife is advocating for her mother, possibly seeing it as a compassionate solution to her loneliness. However, the wife isn't making an effort to improve her relationship with the author's mother, which adds complexity.\n\nThe user might be considered not in the wrong because they are setting boundaries to protect their home environment. It's their home as much as their wife's, and they have the right to feel comfortable there. However, there's a potential conflict with the wife's expectations and the mother-in-law's well-being. The wife's argument that a free room is available and that assisted living is harsh might be seen as prioritizing her mother's needs over the husband's comfort. But the author is also suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which could be a way to address her needs without living together.\n\nThe fact that the wife is unkind to the author's mother complicates things. It might suggest that the wife isn't considering the author's feelings or family equally. The user's resolve isn't about retaliation but about maintaining a comfortable home. So, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is justified in setting boundaries, especially since the wife isn't respectful of his mother either. However, maybe there's a middle ground or communication issues. The key is whether the author's reasons are valid. Since he's being upfront and has legitimate concerns about the mother-in-law's personality, it's not necessarily his fault.\n"
