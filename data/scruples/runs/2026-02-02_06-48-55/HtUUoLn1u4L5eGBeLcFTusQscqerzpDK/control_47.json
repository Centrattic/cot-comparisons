My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation involves family dynamics, personal boundaries, and differing opinions on caregiving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that the mother-in-law doesn't get along with his own mother and that the wife hasn't made efforts to improve that relationship. The author is planning to have another child, which adds to the space considerations. The wife perceives his refusal as selfish and insists on family care over assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. The author is standing his ground on personal comfort and family planning. On the other hand, the wife is pushing for family support for her mother. The question is whether the author's stance is wrong.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions involve balancing individual needs with collective responsibilities. The author's concern about the mother-in-law's personality and the impact on their household is valid. He's also considering future family expansion. However, the wife's perspective emphasizes family care, which is a common cultural expectation in many societies. But does that obligate the author to sacrifice his comfort and home environment?\n\nThe author is not denying support entirely; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living. However, the mother-in-law rejects those options, which complicates things. The author's resolve is strengthened by the wife's lack of effort in mending her relationship with his mother, showing that he's also considering past tensions.\n\nIt's important to note that while family support is important, personal boundaries and mental well-being are also crucial. The author has a right to feel that his home should be a comfortable space for him, his wife, and future children. The wife's insistence on moving in might be seen as imposing without considering the author's valid concerns.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as part of marriage, compromising is necessary, and the author should be more accommodating. But the author isn't refusing all support\u2014just the specific living arrangement. The key is whether his refusal is selfish. Given the mother-in-law's difficult nature and the author's legitimate reasons (space, comfort, future plans), it's reasonable to see the author's position as justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his family's well-being and has valid reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in, especially considering the existing family tensions and practical considerations.\n"
