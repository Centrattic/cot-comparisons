My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer's wife wants her elderly mother to move in. The mother is 70, lives alone, and the wife has been talking about loneliness. The writer is against it because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. They had a conflict when discussing it, and the mother-in-law accused him of being selfish. The writer mentioned considering assisted living, which upset her. Also, the wife's relationship with the writer's mother is bad; she refused to stay with her when they visited his hometown.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. The writer's perspective is that his home should be comfortable for him. He's planning to have another child, so space is a concern. The mother-in-law is difficult, so living together might be stressful. The wife's behavior towards his own mother adds to the tension, showing a potential pattern of one-sidedness.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone. The wife feels her mother is lonely and wants to help. The writer's suggestion of assisted living was met with resistance. The mother-in-law might feel that family support is important and that being with family is better than institutional care.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, he's making a personal choice about his living situation. He's not being unkind, but he's firm. The wife might be using guilt or emotional pressure. The writer's own mother being treated poorly by his wife could indicate that the wife isn't trying to be fair, which might make the writer's reluctance more understandable. However, the mother-in-law is his wife's parent, so there's an expectation to support them. But the writer is clear about his boundaries. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person is being unreasonable. The writer's reasons are personal comfort, space for a future child, and the mother-in-law's difficult personality. These are valid considerations. The mother-in-law's feelings are important, but the writer isn't obligated to sacrifice his own well-being. The wife's treatment of his mother might be another layer, but the question is about the mother-in-law situation. \n\nI think the writer is not in the wrong. He's making a choice based on his living conditions and personal well-being. The mother-in-law's loneliness is a problem, but it's not the writer's responsibility to solve if he's not in a position to handle it. So the answer is B.\n"
