My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The scenario is that the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The husband, however, finds her difficult and judgmental and doesn't want the stress. They had a conflict, and the wife is upset, thinking he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's worried about his living environment, mentions the mother-in-law is hard to get along with, and they're planning a third child. He suggests alternatives like assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that. The wife's side is that she's concerned about her mother's loneliness and feels the husband is being selfish. Also, there's a history where the wife isn't nice to the husband's mother, not even allowing them to stay at her place.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's right to his living space versus the wife's and mother-in-law's needs. The husband argues that he should be comfortable in his home. The wife argues about compassion and family. The husband's past experience with the wife's treatment of his mother might influence his stance, but the question is about this specific situation, not past issues.\n\nLegally and ethically, a person isn't obligated to take in a relative unless it's part of a legal agreement. The husband is making a personal choice based on his comfort and family planning. However, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which adds a layer of concern about her well-being. The husband's suggestion of assisted living is a valid alternative, but the mother-in-law refuses it, possibly due to fear or pride.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that the husband is being selfish, not considering his mother-in-law's loneliness. But the husband is also considering the potential stress and impact on their family, especially with a new child coming. There's a balance between family responsibility and personal well-being.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for adult children to support aging parents, but it's not mandatory. The husband's stance might be seen as self-centered if he's dismissing his mother-in-law's needs without trying to reconcile, but if he's genuinely unable to provide the necessary support and has offered alternatives, it's a personal choice.\n\nThe fact that the wife has a poor relationship with the husband's mother might add context that the wife is not entirely fair in her judgment, but again, the focus is on the current situation. The husband's resolve is based on his own comfort and family's future, which is a valid consideration.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's not legally or morally obligated to take in his mother-in-law. His reasons are based on personal well-being and family planning. While the mother-in-law's situation is unfortunate, the decision is his to make, especially in a shared home. The wife's anger might stem from feeling her mother's needs are unmet, but the husband's right to his home's atmosphere is also valid.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the husband's refusal is seen as selfish. If he's being unreasonable, then A, but if he's standing up for his own needs, then B. Considering all factors, the decision is between personal comfort and family duty. Since the husband is in his own home and the mother-in-law is refusing alternatives, the husband's position isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
