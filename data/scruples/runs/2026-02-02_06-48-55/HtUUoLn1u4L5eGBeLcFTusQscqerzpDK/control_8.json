My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The situation is complicated with family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author mentions his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about living with her. He was upfront about his reasons, but the wife thinks he's selfish. The wife's mom is lonely, but the author is concerned about future kids and space. He suggested assisted living, but she rejected it. Also, the wife is not kind to his mom and refused to stay with her, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to his home and his need for comfort. He's standing his ground because he's not comfortable with his mother-in-law's presence. The wife's perspective is about her mother's loneliness and family support, but the author's feelings are valid too. The wife's behavior towards his mom complicates things, showing a lack of effort to build a good relationship, which supports the author's stance.\n\nAssisted living was suggested as an alternative, but the wife dismissed it. The author is balancing his wife's family needs with his own well-being. Since he's not being unreasonable and has valid concerns, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
