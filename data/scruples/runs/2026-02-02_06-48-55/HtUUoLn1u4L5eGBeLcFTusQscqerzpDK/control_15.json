My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife wants her mother to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother either. The author feels that his home is his space and doesn't want to lose comfort by having the mother-in-law there. They considered assisted living, but the wife opposed that.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the author's reasons. He's being honest about his feelings towards his mother-in-law, which are valid. People have different tolerances for family dynamics, and if he feels that living together would be stressful, that's a personal choice. Also, the wife isn't making an effort to maintain a good relationship with his mother, which adds context. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel; he's setting boundaries. He's even suggested alternatives like assisted living, which the wife rejected. The wife's actions (not allowing them to stay with her mother) might indicate her own issues, giving the author a reason to be cautious. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't denying his wife's mother support entirely but is prioritizing his well-being and family planning (like having another child). It's a balance between family obligations and personal limits. Since he's not being inconsiderate without reason, he's probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
