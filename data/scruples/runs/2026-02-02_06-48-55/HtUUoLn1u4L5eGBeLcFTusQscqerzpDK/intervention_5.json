My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not wanting their mother-in-law to move in with them, despite her being in her 70s and living alone. The author mentions that their wife wants her mother to move in but they find her difficult and judgmental. The wife is upset and thinks the author is being selfish. The author also notes that their wife isn't kind to his own mother, which strengthens his resolve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is resisting a family arrangement that the wife wants. The wife's mother is elderly and alone, which might make people think the author should be compassionate. However, the author has reasons: the mother-in-law is difficult, and they want to have another child. The author also mentions that their wife isn't good with his mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If I look at the arguments, the author is standing by their decision and explaining their reasons. They are not ignoring the wife's feelings entirely but are firm in their stance. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for her mother to move in despite the author's discomfort. The author is considering alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects.\n\nFrom a perspective of family dynamics, it's a delicate balance. The author has a right to their own home and comfort. However, not allowing the mother-in-law to move in might be seen as selfish if the primary motivation is personal discomfort rather than valid concerns like space or safety. But the author does mention planning for another child, which is another family consideration. Also, the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother is mentioned, which complicates things. It's possible that the author is justified in prioritizing their own family's needs and their ability to handle the living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that supporting family, especially when elderly and alone, is a moral obligation. However, the author isn't refusing out of spite but because of genuine incompatibility. The key here is whether the author is being selfish versus standing up for their own boundaries. The fact that the author is considering alternatives shows they are not entirely dismissive of the situation, which could tip the scales in their favor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision is based on their own well-being and family planning, which might make them not in the wrong. They are not being uncompassionate but are making a difficult choice that affects multiple parties. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
