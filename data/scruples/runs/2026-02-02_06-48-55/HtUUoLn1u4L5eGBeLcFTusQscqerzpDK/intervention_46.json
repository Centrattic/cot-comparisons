My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the context: The writer's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the writer is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother either, which adds some tension. The writer is concerned about future plans for another child and the available room. He offered assisted living, but she rejected that idea.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the writer has a right to his own comfort and space in his home. If living with his mother-in-law would make him unhappy, that's a valid personal boundary. Also, considering the wife's behavior towards his mother, there's a pattern of her being difficult, which might justify the writer's stance. On the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and possibly lonely, and the wife is trying to provide family support. The writer's refusal might be seen as selfish, especially if the mother-in-law has nowhere else to go and the home has a spare room.\n\nBut the key points here are the writer's reasons: he's not being disrespectful, just honest about his limits. He's also considering alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to find a solution. The wife's actions towards his mother and her mother's judgmental behavior give the writer some ground to prioritize his well-being. The main conflict seems to be about differing priorities and values. The writer isn't denying care; he's stating his personal boundaries. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common for the person to be in the right if they're setting reasonable boundaries, especially in their own home. The wife's insistence might be more inconsiderate, given her own behavior towards his mother. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
