My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's wife wants her mother to move in because the mother is lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because he finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's concerned about future plans, like having another child, and mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, cutting off family visits.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons: personal comfort, the potential stress of living with a difficult person, and future family planning. On the other hand, the wife's side is about providing care for her mother and perhaps feeling that the author is not compassionate. The wife's lack of effort in improving the relationship with the author's mother might add to the tension, but the author is focusing on the immediate issue of the mother-in-law moving in.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and empathy. While it's understandable that someone might not want to live with a challenging person, the mother-in-law is in a vulnerable position. The author's wife might feel that the author is not supporting her in a time of need for her mother. However, the author is also in his own home and has valid concerns about his living situation and family planning.\n\nThe author's refusal isn't just about dislike; it's about maintaining a livable environment. He's offered alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. The wife's reaction that it's selfish could be due to differing priorities. The author's past experiences with the wife's lack of effort towards his family might justify his stance, but that's a separate issue.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe, but it's also about personal boundaries. The question is whether denying the move-in is unreasonable. If the mother-in-law's needs could be met without causing undue hardship, but the author's home environment is at risk, it's a balance. However, the author is prioritizing his home and family plans over his wife's mother's request. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to support aging parents, but it's not absolute. The author's reasons are valid, especially since the mother-in-law is capable of living independently for now. The author isn't refusing help entirely, just a specific living arrangement. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice that affects his household and has explained his reasons. The wife's mother's situation is unfortunate, but the author's concerns about his family's well-being are also legitimate.\n"
