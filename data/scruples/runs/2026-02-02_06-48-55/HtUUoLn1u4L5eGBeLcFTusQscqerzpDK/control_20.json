My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's mother-in-law is elderly and living alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions they have a free room but are planning to have another child, which might complicate things. They also suggest assisted living, but the mother-in-law opposes that. The wife has a strained relationship with the author's mother and hasn't tried to mend it.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for refusing. They're concerned about their own well-being and the potential stress from living with someone they find difficult. They also mention the possibility of another child, which might make the home less suitable for a parent. The wife is pushing for the move, but her approach seems to be causing conflict. The author feels that their home should be a space where they feel comfortable, which is understandable.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The mother-in-law's needs are valid\u2014she's elderly and alone. However, the author's mental health and comfort in their own home are also important. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother is another factor; if she's unkind, that might affect the dynamics. But the author isn't the one being unkind; they're standing their ground about their living situation.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The author isn't being selfish without reason. They have legitimate concerns about their own well-being and family planning. The mother-in-law's resistance to assisted living is a problem, but the author is trying to find alternatives. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. However, the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their home's comfort for their mother-in-law, especially given the existing tension. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
