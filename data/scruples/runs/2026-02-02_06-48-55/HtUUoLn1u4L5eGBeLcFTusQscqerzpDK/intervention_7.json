My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. Let me look at the details again.\n\nThe mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author feels the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about not wanting her to live with them. The wife gets upset, calling him selfish. The author mentions they have a free room but plan to have another child. They also discussed assisted living, which the wife didn't like. Additionally, the wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother and wouldn't stay with her, opting for a hotel instead.\n\nThe author argues that his home should be a place where he's comfortable. But is he in the wrong? Well, family dynamics are complex. The author has valid concerns about his own comfort and future family plans. However, the wife's mother is elderly and alone. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting his wife's needs. But the wife also isn't making an effort to reconcile with the author's mother, which might affect the balance.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author's decision is understandable. He's prioritizing his mental well-being and family planning. While it's a tough spot, it's a personal choice. So, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
