My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. \n\nFirst, the author explains his reasons: his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's worried about handling her presence, especially since they plan to have another child. He's upfront about his reasons, but his wife is upset, calling him selfish. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's mother, not even allowing them to stay at her place.\n\nSo, the author is standing his ground, saying it's his home too. He's considering assisted living as an alternative. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and living alone, which raises concerns about her well-being. The wife is pushing for her to move in, possibly out of loneliness. But the author has valid reasons: the mother-in-law is hard to handle, and they need the room for a future child. Also, the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother is problematic, adding another layer of tension.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe not. He's balancing practical considerations (space for a child) and his own comfort. The wife's approach seems to lack effort in fixing her own relationship issues, which might be a red flag. The author isn't ignoring his mother-in-law's needs but is suggesting alternatives. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author was upfront about his reasons, which is good. The wife's reaction might be more about feeling rejected than about her mother's needs. The author's stance seems reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). He's making a tough decision based on practicality and personal boundaries, and the wife's behavior also contributes to the conflict.\n"
