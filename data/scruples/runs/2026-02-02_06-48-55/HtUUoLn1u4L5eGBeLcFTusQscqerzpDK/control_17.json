My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author feels she's difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, even refusing to stay with her. The author is concerned about future children and having a free room. When he suggested assisted living, the mother-in-law compared it to prison. \n\nThe author argues that his home should be a place where he feels comfortable. The wife, on the other hand, is pushing for her mother to move in, which he's resisting. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the mother-in-law is alone and elderly, so there's a sense of responsibility. But the author has valid concerns about his living situation and his own family's needs. He's also pointing out the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother, which might imply some imbalance. \n\nBut is it about fairness? The author is making a choice that affects both his wife and his mother-in-law. He's not being disrespectful, just stating his limits. The wife is pressuring him, but he's standing by his reasons. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not being selfish without reason. He's considering practical aspects like future children and the nature of his wife's mother. Also, the wife's history of being unkind to his mother might mean she's not exactly being fair. So, the author is within his rights to decline. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's being honest about his limits and considering the household's future. The mother-in-law's feelings are important, but the author's well-being and family planning are too.\n"
