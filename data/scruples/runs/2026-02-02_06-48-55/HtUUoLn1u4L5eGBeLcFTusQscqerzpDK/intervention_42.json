My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author is at fault for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a concern. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the mother-in-law's comments are a problem, and he's worried about handling her presence. The wife is upset, thinking he's selfish and not compassionate. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea, comparing it to prison. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's mother, not allowing visits, which he uses to justify his stance.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about family dynamics and personal boundaries. On one hand, the author is concerned about his well-being and family life with his wife. He does mention considering alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to find solutions, but the mother-in-law isn't open to that. On the other hand, the wife is pushing for her mother to move in, possibly to address her loneliness. The author's argument is that it's his home as much as hers, and he should feel comfortable.\n\nBut wait, the wife's behavior towards his own mother complicates things. If she's been unkind and refused to improve that relationship, maybe that affects the dynamic. The author could be using that as a reason to justify his decision, which might not be fair. Also, the mother-in-law's desire to live with her daughter versus the son-in-law's resistance. Family situations are tricky. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on perspectives. If the author is being selfish by not accommodating his wife's mother, especially when there's a free room and the mother-in-law's loneliness is a factor, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the mother-in-law is truly difficult and the author's mental health or family life is at stake, he's not necessarily wrong. However, he did suggest alternatives, but the mother-in-law rejected them. Also, the wife's previous actions towards the author's mother might indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own family's needs over his. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's asserting his right to a comfortable home. However, he could be wrong if he's dismissive of his wife's emotional needs and the mother-in-law's situation. But given that he's tried to find solutions (assisted living) and the mother-in-law is resistant to that, maybe he's justified. The answer likely hinges on whether his refusal is based on legitimate concerns rather than selfishness. The wife's behavior towards his mother might also play a role in balancing the situation. Since the author is upfront about his reasons and the mother-in-law is unwilling to consider alternatives, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. So, B (No).\n"
