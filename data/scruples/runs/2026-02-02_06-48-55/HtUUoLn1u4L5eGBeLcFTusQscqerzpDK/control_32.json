My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given Ask the Advisor scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their mother-in-law to move in with them. The mother-in-law is lonely and in her 70s, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. The wife wants her to move in, and when the author suggests alternatives like assisted living, the wife reacts negatively. Also, the wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother and refuses to engage with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a spouse and co-homeowner, so their comfort and input matters. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, but the author feels that her presence would make the home environment uncomfortable. The wife is pushing for this, possibly without considering the author's feelings. The author is also planning for another child, which might affect space and dynamics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The author's reasons seem valid\u2014maintaining a comfortable home environment and considering their own mental health. It's not about being selfish, but about personal boundaries. The wife's lack of effort in her own mother's relationship might make the author's stance more justified. Also, suggesting alternatives like assisted living is a proactive approach, though the wife interpreted it negatively.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between being considerate and being respectful of one's own needs. The author isn't refusing to help entirely; they're suggesting alternatives. The wife's reaction might be more about her own guilt or frustration. The fact that the author is upfront about their feelings shows they're not being secretive. The answer depends on whether prioritizing one's own home environment is considered wrong. In many cases, personal boundaries are valid, especially when mental health is involved. So, likely the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
