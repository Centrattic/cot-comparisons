My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The husband is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. They have a free room but plan to have another child. The wife accuses him of being selfish. The husband suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. Also, the wife isn't nice to his own mother, which makes him more resolved to say no.\n\nSo, the husband's main arguments are about his own comfort and the potential for conflict. He mentions that the mother-in-law is difficult, so living together might be stressful. He also points out the need for the extra room for a future child, which is a practical concern. On the other hand, the wife argues that they should help her mother, implying the husband is being selfish.\n\nNow, considering what's right or wrong. The husband is making a personal choice about his living situation. It's his home as much as his wife's, so he has a right to set boundaries. However, there's a responsibility to care for aging parents, but that can vary based on cultural norms and individual circumstances. The wife's mother wants to move in, but the husband can't handle the dynamic. The husband also mentions his wife isn't kind to his mother, which complicates things. \n\nIs it selfish? Maybe not, because he's prioritizing his mental health and future family planning. The mother-in-law's perspective is that family should care for each other, but the husband's well-being is also important. There's no legal obligation here, just a personal and relational conflict. The husband isn't refusing help entirely; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living. The mother-in-law rejects that, so he's not wrong for not forcing himself into a situation he's uncomfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife feels her mother's needs are unmet. But the husband is clear about his reasons. It's a tough call, but in terms of right or wrong, the husband is making a personal decision that's valid for him. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
