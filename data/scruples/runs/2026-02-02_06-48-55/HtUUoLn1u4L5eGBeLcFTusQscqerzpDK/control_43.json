My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA = Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: he finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's worried about living with her because her personality is hard to handle. He also mentions they plan to have another child, so space is an issue. He suggested assisted living, but she saw that as cruel.\n\nThen, there's the context about the wife not getting along with the author's own mother, even refusing to stay at his hometown. The author feels this strengthens his resolve because he wants his home to be comfortable for him too.\n\nThe main question is whether he's being selfish. On one hand, respecting his own boundaries and comfort is important. On the other, the wife's mother is alone and in her 70s. However, the wife's actions towards the author's mother might show a pattern of being difficult. The author isn't refusing out of cruelty but personal well-being. The wife's reaction to assisted living as \"a step above prison\" is questionable too, as it might not be in the mother's best interest. \n\nSo, the author isn't being inconsiderate; he's setting boundaries, especially considering future family plans. The wife's lack of effort in her own relationships adds to the complexity. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his home environment and mental health. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
