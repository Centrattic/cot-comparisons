My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The author's main points are that his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and he's worried about handling her presence. He also mentions his wife's pushiness and her own issues with the author's mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is setting boundaries, which is something many people do to maintain their mental health and family harmony. He's honest about his feelings, which is good. However, the wife is pressuring him, and there's a generational aspect too. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and living alone, which might make people feel she needs support. But the author has valid concerns about her being difficult.\n\nThen there's the part about the wife not being kind to the author's mother, which complicates things. The author might feel justified in his stance because of the wife's behavior towards his own family. But does that absolve him from considering his mother-in-law's situation? Maybe not entirely, but it adds context.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to his own home, the wife's manipulation, the mother-in-law's character, and the author's willingness to explore alternatives like assisted living. The author is not being cruel; he's prioritizing his family's well-being. However, the wife might feel neglected, but that's part of the marital conflict here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is upfront about his reasons and has alternatives in mind. He's not being cruel or selfish just for wanting to maintain his home environment. The wife's actions might be the bigger issue here, but the author's decision isn't necessarily the problem. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
