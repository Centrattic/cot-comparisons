My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out which one is correct based on the situation provided.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is resistant because his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that a little of her goes a long way and he's worried about his own comfort in the home. He also brought up assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected, comparing it to prison. The wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother and refuses to even stay with her when visiting, opting for hotels instead. The author feels this makes his resolve stronger because he wants his home to be comfortable for him and mentions planning another child.\n\nNow, considering AITA standards, the key points are whether the author's actions are selfish or if he has valid reasons. The author is direct about his discomfort, which might be seen as not being considerate. However, he also points out the wife's lack of effort in his own family relationships. The mother-in-law is in a vulnerable age group and living alone, so there's a need for support. But the author's main argument is about his own well-being and future family plans. \n\nI should evaluate if his refusal is justified. Being respectful but setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. If the mother-in-law is difficult, it's reasonable to consider the impact on family life. However, the wife's perspective might feel ignored. The author did offer alternatives (assisted living), but the mother-in-law rejected them. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother could be a red flag, but the author is using that as a reason to avoid his own mother-in-law. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often split the difference. The author's right to his own home and comfort is valid, but the lack of compassion from his side might make him the asshole. However, the wife's behavior is also problematic. The mother-in-law's loneliness is a concern, but the author isn't obligated to take her in if it causes him significant distress. The fact that he's planning another child adds to the living situation considerations.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The author's resistance is based on personal comfort and practical considerations, but he might come off as dismissive of his mother-in-law's needs. The mother-in-law's strong reaction to assisted living is a problem too, as it's a valid concern if that's her perception. The wife's role in pushing for this without effort in other relationships complicates things, but the author's stance isn't entirely without merit. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't force his wife to have a bad relationship with his mother, but he's using that as a justification. His refusal isn't necessarily the worst thing, especially if the mother-in-law is hard to live with. But the way he handled it, maybe being too quick to shut it down without more discussion or compromise could make him the asshole. However, the mother-in-law's own rejection of alternatives might also play a role. \n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author is honest about his reasons, which is good, but the wife's side might feel unaddressed. In AITA, the focus is on the person's actions and whether they're being unfair. The author's main issue is the mother-in-law's personality, which is a personal struggle. He's also planning a child, so space is a factor. But the mother-in-law is alone and the wife is concerned about her loneliness. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's being upfront and has valid concerns about his own comfort and future family. However, the user might expect A because the mother-in-law is in a vulnerable situation. But the author isn't ignoring her; he's offering alternatives. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother could indicate that the wife might not be handling family dynamics well, which might affect the perception of the author's stance. \n\nWait, but the question is about the author's decision. If the wife is making the request, the author can say no. The problem is whether he's being unreasonable. The mother-in-law's behavior is described as difficult and judgmental, which the author has experienced. So it's a personal choice about what the author can handle. The answer is likely B because he's in his right to set boundaries for his home, even if the mother-in-law is alone. However, maybe some would argue he's not being compassionate enough, hence A. \n\nBut given the details, the author is not being inconsiderate; he's expressing his limits. He's also considering the future child. So I lean towards B. However, the user's own opinion is A, so I need to make sure. The key is whether the author is being selfish without valid reasons. If the mother-in-law is hard to get along with, the author's reasons are valid, so he's not the asshole.\n"
