My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The answer needs to be either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is refusing his wife's mother from moving in. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in, but the husband feels he can't handle her being around because she's difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons, but the wife is upset, calling him selfish. The husband mentions they have a free room and plan to have another child, so space is a consideration. He suggests assisted living, but the wife disagrees strongly. Also, the wife has a poor relationship with the husband's mother, to the point of not allowing them to stay with her.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. The key factors here would be: the husband's right to feel comfortable in his home, the wife's push to include her mother, the potential strain on the marriage, and the alternative solutions proposed. The husband is asserting his home as his own, which is a valid point. However, the wife's mother's situation is also a concern\u2014living alone and elderly. The husband's suggestion for assisted living might be a reasonable alternative, but the wife is against it. The wife's behavior towards the husband's mother adds complexity, indicating possible imbalance in her approach to family relations.\n\nIs the husband being selfish? He's prioritizing his own well-being and the potential future of the family (another child) over accommodating his wife's mother. However, the wife's loneliness and concern for her mother's welfare are also valid. The husband's refusal isn't out of malice but personal discomfort, which is a common issue in such family dynamics.\n\nThe user might be leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the husband is being honest about his feelings and considering alternatives. But there's a risk of the wife feeling neglected or the mother-in-law being left in a vulnerable situation. The husband's stance on his own home's comfort is a significant factor. However, the wife's lack of effort in her own family relationships (with his mother) might mitigate the blame towards the husband, as it shows the wife's own issues. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably or without consideration. The husband did communicate his reasons and proposed alternatives, which shows he's not entirely dismissive. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
