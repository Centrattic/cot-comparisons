My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife is pushing for her to move in because she's lonely. The husband is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions they have a free room but are planning to have another child. The wife accuses him of being selfish. He suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. Also, the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to his perspective.\n\nSo, the key points here are about family dynamics, personal boundaries, and caregiving responsibilities. The husband is standing his ground, prioritizing his mental well-being and family planning. The wife is pushing for her mother's move, possibly due to guilt or a desire for more support. The mother-in-law's strong personality and the wife's strained relationship with the husband's mother add layers to the conflict.\n\nI need to assess whether the husband's refusal is justified. Factors like the mother-in-law's behavior, their future plans for another child, and the wife's treatment of his mother are important. The husband is being honest about his limits, which is reasonable. However, there's also the consideration of supporting a family member in need. But given that the wife isn't making efforts in her own family relationships, maybe the husband's stance is more about personal boundaries than selfishness. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's setting healthy boundaries for his family's well-being, considering future plans, and the mother-in-law's difficult behavior. Also, the wife's actions towards his mother might influence his decision being more about self-respect than selfishness.\n"
