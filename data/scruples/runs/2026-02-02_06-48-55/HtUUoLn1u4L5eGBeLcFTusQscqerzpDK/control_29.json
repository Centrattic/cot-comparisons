My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The AITA question is about whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is a husband who's refusing his wife's mother to move in. His reasons are that the mother-in-law is difficult, judgmental, and he can't handle living with her. The wife is pushing for this, maybe because she's concerned about her mother's loneliness. The author mentions they have a free room but also plan to have another child. The wife isn't kind to his own mother, which he brings up, but he says it's not tit for tat. He's standing by his decision because he wants to maintain his comfort and home environment.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From the information given, the author is being upfront about his reasons. He's not ignoring the wife's feelings but is firm in his stance. The wife is being unsupportive of his mother, which might add to the tension. The author's concern about the mother-in-law's personality and the impact on their living situation seems valid. He's also considering alternatives like assisted living, but the wife opposes that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. The author here is making a decision based on his own comfort and the potential strain on their household. While the mother-in-law's situation is sad, the author isn't obligated to host her, especially with the existing tensions. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might justify the author's stance. So, the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong here.\n"
