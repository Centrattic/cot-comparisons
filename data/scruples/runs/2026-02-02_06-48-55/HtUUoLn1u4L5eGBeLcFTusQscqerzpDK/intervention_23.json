My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author explains that their mother-in-law is difficult, judgmental, and that living with her would be hard. They also mention that they have a free room, but they plan to have another child. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law was against that.\n\nThe wife is upset and the author feels that his home should be a comfortable space for him too. He doesn't want to sacrifice his comfort for his wife's mother. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and might need support. The wife's refusal to even visit the author's mother might suggest a lack of effort on her part, which could affect the dynamics here. The author is standing his ground because he doesn't want to lose his home's comfort and stability with another child coming.\n\nBut is it wrong? It's about boundaries. The author has a right to his home and his emotional well-being. The mother-in-law's needs might be valid, but if she's a difficult person, the author isn't obligated to take her in. However, suggesting assisted living was met with hostility, so maybe there's a need for compromise or more support. \n\nBut the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. I think it's not wrong because he's respecting his own comfort and the future plans with another child. The wife's mother's situation is unfortunate, but the author isn't responsible for that. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
