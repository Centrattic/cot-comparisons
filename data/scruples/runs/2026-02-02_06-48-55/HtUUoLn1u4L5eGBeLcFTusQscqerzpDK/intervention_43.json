My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, so I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He's being upfront about his reasons\u2014his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions they have a free room but plan to have another child. He's concerned about losing his home's comfort. He also points out that his wife is unkind to his own mother, staying at a hotel instead of his parents' house. That adds context to his decision.\n\nOn the flip side, his wife's side: She's trying to help her lonely mother, especially since she's in her 70s. The mother-in-law feels her son-in-law is selfish for not allowing her to live with family and is considering assisted living, which she compares to prison. The mother-in-law's argument is that family should take care of her, not institutions.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. Family relationships can be complex. The author has a right to his living space and comfort. However, the wife's mother is elderly and may need support. The author's wife's behavior towards his mother might influence his stance. But the key is whether he's being unreasonable. He's clear about his reasons and suggests alternatives like assisted living. His wife's mother might not want those options, but the author is respecting his own boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether prioritizing his own comfort and family planning (another child) over his wife's mother's needs makes him the asshole. There's no legal obligation, but social expectations vary. If he's being respectful and offering alternatives, maybe he's justified. However, if the wife feels neglected and the mother-in-law is truly in need, others might see it as selfish. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's being honest about his limits and considering future family needs. However, there's nuance if the mother-in-law's situation is dire, but the story doesn't indicate that. His wife's lack of effort with his mother might also justify his stance. So, the answer is B.\n"
