My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation got ugly when he explained his reasons, and the wife accused him of being selfish. He also points out that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. On one hand, the wife's mother is elderly and lonely, and family support is often expected. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about his well-being and the potential stress of living with someone difficult. He also mentions plans for another child, which adds to the living situation complexity. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might affect the author's stance. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to have family live with you. Emotionally, it's a family conflict. The author is standing his ground for personal reasons, which could be seen as selfish by others, but it's his home too. The answer likely depends on cultural expectations and personal boundaries. Since the author is prioritizing his mental health and family planning, many might side with him. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
