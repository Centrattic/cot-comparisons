My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The wife got upset, calling the author selfish. The author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother and refuses to improve that relationship. The author feels it's their home too and not comfortable with the mother-in-law living there.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's reasons for refusing. They mention the mother-in-law is difficult and that they don't want to live with her. They also suggest alternatives like assisted living. The wife's actions towards the author's mother are brought up as context.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often have conflicting priorities. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, but the author's comfort and the home environment matter too. The author is being honest about their feelings, which isn't inherently wrong. However, there's a social expectation to support family, especially elderly relatives. But the author is setting boundaries, which is valid if the mother-in-law's presence would cause significant stress.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother is part of the dynamic, but that doesn't directly make the author right or wrong. The author's stance is about their own comfort and family planning (another child), which are legitimate considerations. The mother-in-law's opinion that assisted living is worse than prison is a strong statement, but the author's suggestion is based on their assessment of the situation.\n\nSo, the author is not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their household's well-being. They are not forcing the mother-in-law to stay with them but offering alternatives. The key is whether the author's refusal is selfish. Since they are being honest and considering alternatives, it's more about personal boundaries than selfishness. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
