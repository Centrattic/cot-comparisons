My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. The author's main reasons are that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they want to keep their home comfortable, plus they plan to have another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upfront about their reasons, which is good. They mention respecting the mother-in-law but can't handle living together. The wife is pushing for the move, citing loneliness, but the author feels it's not feasible. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's mother, which adds context. \n\nThe author suggests assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. The user is asking if the author is wrong for saying no. In terms of family dynamics, it's common for in-laws to have differing opinions. The author is standing by their decision based on personal comfort and future family plans. They aren't being cruel; they're being honest. The wife's reaction might be seen as unfair, especially since she's also not making an effort with the author's mother. \n\nSo, the author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and communicated them upfront. The wife's perspective is also valid, but the author isn't the asshole here. They're prioritizing their home environment and future plans, which is their right.\n"
