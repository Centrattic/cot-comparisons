My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's wife wants the mother-in-law to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that the mother-in-law has a bad relationship with their wife's side, especially the wife's own mother. The author is also planning to have another child, so space is an issue.\n\nThe author feels that their home is a place where they should be comfortable, and they think the mother-in-law's presence would make that difficult. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law and wife rejected that idea, viewing it as inhumane. The wife is also not making an effort to improve her relationship with the author's mother, which adds to the author's stance.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author is standing their ground about their personal space and comfort. They're not being selfish just for wanting to maintain their home environment. The mother-in-law's character is described as difficult, so the author's reluctance isn't without reason. However, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which could make others see the author as not compassionate.\n\nBut the key here is the author's right to their home and their well-being. The wife is pushing for this, but the author is clear that their home is a shared space. The author is also being practical about future family planning. The mother-in-law's own behavior and the wife's lack of effort towards the author's mother might make the author's position more understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both sides. Here, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because their reasons are valid and they're standing up for their needs. The mother-in-law's situation is unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her living arrangements over their own family's comfort and future plans. So, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
