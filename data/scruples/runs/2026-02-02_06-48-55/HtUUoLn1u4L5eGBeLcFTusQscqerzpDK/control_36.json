My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation as presented. The author's mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife (author's spouse) has been lonely and wants her mom to move in. The author is against it because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. They had a fight about it, with the author suggesting assisted living, which the wife rejected. The author also mentions that his wife isn't nice to his own mom, not even allowing them to stay at her place when visiting his hometown. The author feels his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and he's worried that the mother-in-law's presence would make that impossible.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in are based on his own comfort and the potential stress of dealing with a difficult person. He's also considering future plans like having another child. The wife, on the other hand, feels the author is being selfish and not compassionate. The author points out his wife's own lack of effort in maintaining a good relationship with his mom as a counterpoint, but he says it's not a tit-for-tat situation.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, people often look at whether there's a balance of empathy, respect, and practicality. The author is upfront about his reasons. He's not trying to hide that he finds his mother-in-law difficult. He's also considering future family plans. However, the wife's perspective is that he's not being compassionate to her mother's loneliness. \n\nBut then there's the part where the author's wife isn't kind to his own mother, which he brings up. That might suggest that the wife has a pattern of being difficult with in-laws, which could support the author's stance. However, using that as a justification might complicate things. But the author says it's not a tit-for-tat, so he's not holding it against her for her mom's sake but rather his own comfort.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to host his mother-in-law. It's his home as much as his wife's. If they're in a partnership, they should negotiate such things. But the author's reasons are valid because living with a difficult person can be stressful. The wife's arguments about compassion might not outweigh the author's need for a comfortable home environment, especially if there are other solutions like assisted living (though the wife rejected that because she thinks it's harsh). However, the author's suggestion of assisted living might be a better alternative if it's suitable, but the wife's rejection complicates that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not being disrespectful but is standing his ground for his own well-being. The wife is pushing for something that he genuinely can't handle. Unless there's a clear obligation (like a cultural expectation), the author's decision seems reasonable. People often cite their own mental health as a valid reason in AITA posts. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he's being selfish if the wife is genuinely concerned about her mother's well-being. But given the author's explanation and the wife's own behavior towards his mom, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The key is that the author isn't ignoring his wife's feelings but is stating his own boundaries. So, probably B.\n"
