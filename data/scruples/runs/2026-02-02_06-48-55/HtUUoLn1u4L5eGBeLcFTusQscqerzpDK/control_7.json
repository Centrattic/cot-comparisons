My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The situation involves the mother-in-law being 70, living alone, and the wife wanting her to move in. The husband is against it because she's difficult and judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's prioritizing his own comfort and the potential future of having another child. He's also suggested alternative solutions like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. He values his home as a shared space and doesn't want to lose his comfort.\n\nThen there's the wife's side. She's concerned about her mother's loneliness and feels the husband is being selfish. The wife also has a poor relationship with her own mother, not even allowing visits to the husband's hometown. The author points out that the wife hasn't tried to repair that relationship, which might affect her credibility in expecting the husband to take in her mother.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's reasons are personal boundaries and future planning, the wife's demands might be unrealistic given the mother's personality, and the wife's own behavior towards her mother complicates the situation. \n\nIs the husband being selfish? Maybe not. He's making a valid choice about his living situation. The mother-in-law's character and the wife's lack of effort in her own family dynamics might justify his decision. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
