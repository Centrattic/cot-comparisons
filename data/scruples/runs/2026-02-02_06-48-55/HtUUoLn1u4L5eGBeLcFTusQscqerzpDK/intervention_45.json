My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The scenario is presented in an AITA format. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author resists, saying the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions the free room but also plans to have another child. The wife gets upset, calling him selfish. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea. Also, there's a mention of the wife being unkind to the author's own mother, which might add context to their relationship dynamics.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and lonely. The wife is trying to help her. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about the mother-in-law's personality making cohabitation stressful. He also mentions plans for another child, which means space and resources are a factor. The author is standing by his decision, emphasizing his home should be comfortable for him too.\n\nIn AITA cases, it's common to consider both sides. The author's reasons are practical and emotional. He's not being cruel but setting boundaries. The wife's mother's needs are real, but the author's well-being and family planning matter too. The wife's past behavior (not allowing the author to visit his mother) might show a pattern of imbalance, which the author is trying to correct.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has legitimate concerns about living with a difficult relative, family planning, and past issues with the wife's treatment of his mother. He's not being inconsiderate but asserting his own needs. The mother-in-law's rejection of assisted living complicates things, but the author's suggestion was an alternative. \n\nIn many cases, it's not a black-and-white wrong. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his family's current situation. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries for a healthy home environment.\n"
