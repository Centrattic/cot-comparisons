My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author is at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's concerned about his own comfort and the possibility of having another child. He also mentions that his wife has been unkind to his own mother, which he feels strengthens his resolve. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a vulnerable situation. The wife wants her mom to move in, arguing that the house has a free room. The author's refusal is seen as selfish by his wife, especially since he suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting her to move in versus the wife's and mother-in-law's perspective on the situation. The author is prioritizing his own and his family's well-being, but the mother-in-law's need for companionship and support is also a factor. \n\nThe author is upfront about his reasons, which he believes are valid. However, the wife's family situation is also a consideration. The author's wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, as it shows a lack of mutual family support. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's being honest about his ability to handle the situation. But maybe there's a middle ground, like exploring other options for the mother-in-law besides moving in. However, the author did mention considering assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected. \n\nSo, the author's main argument is about his own comfort and the family's future. While it's a tough situation, it's his home too, and he has the right to feel that. But the emotional aspect is high here. \n\nIn the end, I think it's a complex situation, but the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest and considering practical aspects like the possibility of another child. The wife's perspective is also valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own well-being. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
