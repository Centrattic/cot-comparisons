My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is that the wife wants her mom to move in because the mother is in her 70s and feels lonely. The author is against it because his mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The wife got upset, called him selfish, and there's some back and forth about their plans for another child and assisted living. The author also notes that his wife isn't kind to his mother, not even staying with her when visiting her hometown.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author is concerned about the mother-in-law's personality traits (difficult, judgmental) and how that would affect their home life. They have a free room but also plan for another child. The wife is pushing for the move, maybe without fully considering the husband's perspective. The author suggests alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. Also, the wife's treatment of the husband's mother might be relevant, though it's not directly related to the main issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not obligated to have his mother-in-law live with them. Family dynamics are complex, and each person's comfort is important. The wife's expectations might be unrealistic if she's not addressing the husband's valid concerns. The author is being honest about his feelings and the potential impact on their family. While the mother-in-law's situation is unfortunate, the decision to live together should consider both partners' well-being. The wife's refusal to visit the husband's mother could indicate a pattern of prioritizing her own family's needs without reciprocity, but that's a separate issue. \n\nThe main issue here is autonomy and mutual agreement in a marriage. If the husband isn't comfortable with the arrangement, especially given the mother-in-law's traits and future plans for a child, it's reasonable for him to say no. The wife might feel her mother needs support, but the husband's right to a comfortable home shouldn't be dismissed. The author isn't being mean-spirited; he's setting boundaries. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
