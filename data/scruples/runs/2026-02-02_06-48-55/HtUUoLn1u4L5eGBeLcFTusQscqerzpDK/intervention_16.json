My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The author explains that their mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they're concerned about having another child and the free room. They also mention that their wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is standing their ground, saying it's their home and they can't handle living with her. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which raises concerns about her well-being. The wife feels the author is being selfish, while he thinks he's being reasonable. \n\nThe key points here are the dynamics of family relationships and personal boundaries. The author's reasons are based on their own comfort and future plans (another child), and they offered alternatives like assisted living. However, the mother-in-law feels rejected and the wife is upset. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to balance respect for one's own space and the needs of aging family members. The author isn't necessarily being cruel; they're asserting their right to a comfortable home. However, maybe they could have found a middle ground or shown more empathy. But the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother complicates things. \n\nI think the author has valid reasons, especially considering the impact on their family. They tried to suggest alternatives, even if those were met with resistance. The mother-in-law's strong reaction might be part of her being difficult as described. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
