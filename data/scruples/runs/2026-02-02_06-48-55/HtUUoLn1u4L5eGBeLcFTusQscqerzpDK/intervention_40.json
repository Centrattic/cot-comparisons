My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The writer explains that their wife's mom is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The writer feels that she's difficult and judgmental, so they don't want her to live with them. The discussion got ugly, and the wife accused them of being selfish. The writer mentions their own home and the possibility of another child, suggesting that moving in isn't feasible. They also mention that the wife is unkind to his own mother, which makes him more resolved.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is about family dynamics and personal boundaries. The writer's position is that they have the right to be comfortable in their home, and the mother-in-law's presence would make that impossible. The wife, on the other hand, feels the mother is lonely and deserves family support. The writer is also considering the future with another child and a free room. But they also mention that the wife isn't making an effort to improve her relationship with the writer's mom, which might add context.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to say no to family moving in? Well, family support is important, but so are personal boundaries. The writer is honest about their feelings, which is crucial. However, the wife's mother's well-being is a concern. The writer suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that, seeing it as worse than prison. That's a tough spot. The writer's reasoning includes practical aspects like space for a future child and the home being their place, which seems valid. On the other hand, the wife's mother's loneliness and need for support can't be ignored. \n\nBut then there's the dynamic with the wife. The wife isn't making an effort with the writer's mom, which might influence the situation. If the wife is unkind to the writer's mom, that could justify the writer's reservations about her mother-in-law. The writer is standing up for their own comfort and the home's environment, which is a personal right. However, maybe the writer could explore other options, like helping find a supportive living arrangement that the mother-in-law might accept, rather than just saying no. But the writer did mention that the wife dismissed those options, calling them worse than prison. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They are being honest about their feelings and considering practical matters. The wife's mother's needs are valid, but the writer's right to a comfortable home and their own relationship dynamics (with the wife being unkind to his mom) add complexity. The writer's refusal is based on genuine concerns, not just selfishness. They're also considering future family plans. However, the way the discussion went down might have been handled better, but the stance itself isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations too, but since this is a general question, I should focus on the ethics and practicality. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons and are standing up for their own family's needs and comfort. They are also considering the wife's mother's well-being by suggesting alternatives, even if those weren't accepted. The wife's behavior complicates things, but the writer's position is justified.\n"
