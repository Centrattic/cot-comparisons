My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they should let their mother-in-law move in with them. The user is asking if they are at fault here.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the user is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The user says they tried to be respectful but can't handle it. They also mention that their wife is unkind to his own mother, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe user's main argument is that it's their home too, and they should feel comfortable. They're worried about losing that comfort if the mother-in-law moves in. On the other hand, the wife is pushing for this, and the mother-in-law feels it's a family obligation. The user suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea, thinking it's harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault. In terms of rights, the user has a right to their own living space and comfort. They have a valid reason to prioritize their own well-being and family's needs. However, there's also a consideration of family duty, especially with an aging parent. But the mother-in-law's difficult personality complicates things. The user is also considering future children, which adds another layer.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the user's own mother might make the user feel justified in not wanting to accommodate her mother-in-law. It's a balance between compassion and personal boundaries. Since the user is honest about their feelings and offers alternative solutions (like assisted living), they're trying to be responsible. The mother-in-law's judgmental nature might make the living arrangement problematic regardless of intentions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, it seems the user is not in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns about their own family's comfort and future. The answer should be B.\n"
