My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. But the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. They tried to explain their reasons but the conversation got ugly. The wife accused them of being selfish, but the author argues that they have a right to their home and comfort, especially since they might have another child soon.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting the author's boundaries versus the wife's concern for her mother. The author is clear that they don't have a problem in principle with helping, but the mother-in-law's personality makes cohabitation problematic. They also mention that the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, which might add to the tension.\n\nThe wife's argument is that the author lacks compassion by suggesting assisted living, but the author counters that they do care and want to find a solution that works for everyone. However, they feel that forcing the mother-in-law to live with them would compromise their own living situation and comfort.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They have valid concerns about their well-being and the potential impact on their family dynamics. It's important to balance family obligations with personal boundaries. If the wife is being unkind to the author's mother, that might also affect the overall family dynamic negatively, so the author's stance could be justified as self-preservation. However, there's a cultural aspect to consider where some people expect adult children to care for their parents, but the author is making a choice based on their own circumstances. So, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
