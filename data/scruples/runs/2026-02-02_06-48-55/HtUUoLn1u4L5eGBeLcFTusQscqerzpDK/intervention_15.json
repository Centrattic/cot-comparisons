My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the mother-in-law move in with them. The author explains that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they have a free room but plan to have another child. The wife is upset, calling the author selfish, and the author feels it's about their comfort and the home being shared equally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons: the mother-in-law is hard to be around, and the author wants the room for a future child. The wife is pushing for her mom to move in, which the author resists. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which adds to the emotional aspect.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Family dynamics can be tricky. On one hand, the author has valid concerns about their living space and personal comfort. They mention the mother-in-law's personality as a challenge. On the other hand, the wife's mother is in a vulnerable situation, and the author's refusal might be seen as not supporting their spouse's needs. However, the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother (refusing to stay with her) might affect the balance here too. The author argues that it's their home as much as the wife's and they should be comfortable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions, fairness, and potential for resolution. The author is being upfront and has alternative solutions (assisted living), which shows they're not entirely dismissive. However, the wife's perspective is also valid. But given the author's reasons are based on their own well-being and practical considerations, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. Since the mother-in-law is challenging and the author has a legitimate need for space, perhaps the answer is B. But I need to check if there's a cultural expectation where supporting the mother-in-law is mandatory. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about cultural norms. The author is standing up for their own home and comfort, which is a right. So the answer might be B.\n"
