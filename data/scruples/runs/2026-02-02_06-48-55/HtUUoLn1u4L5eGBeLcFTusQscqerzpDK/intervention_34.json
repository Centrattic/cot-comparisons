My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is resistant because the mother-in-law is described as difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they tried to be upfront about their reasons, but the wife was upset. The author also brings up that they plan to have another child and that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which he says makes him more resolute.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nSo, considering family dynamics. The author is in a position where they're making a decision that affects their spouse's family. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, but the author is also considering their own comfort and future plans (another child). The wife's reaction might be influenced by her own feelings of loneliness and perhaps a history of tension with the author's mother.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their living space versus the wife's wishes and the mother-in-law's needs. The author argues that the mother-in-law is difficult and that they can't handle living with her. The wife, on the other hand, feels that the author is being selfish and not compassionate. The author suggests assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. \n\nIn terms of fairness, is it reasonable for the author to refuse? It's a personal decision, but it's part of a family arrangement. The author's home is shared with their spouse, so both should have a say. However, the author's spouse might feel that the author isn't considering her mother's well-being. The author's past interactions with the wife's mother and the wife's lack of effort with his mother might add to the tension. \n\nThe author's resolve is strengthened by the wife's behavior towards his own mother. That could be a factor in his decision, but maybe the focus should be on the current situation rather than past issues. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to their living environment. However, the way they handled the discussion might be an issue. Being upfront is good, but dismissing the wife's concerns as selfish could be part of the problem. Also, the author's own stance on the wife's mother versus his own mother might come across as biased. \n\nBut the main question is about the decision to not let the mother-in-law move in. The author's reasons are based on personal comfort and the impact on their family plan. In that case, it's their home as much as the wife's, so they have a valid point. However, the wife's feelings and the mother-in-law's isolation are also valid concerns. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area, but I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they can't be expected to sacrifice their own well-being for the wife's mother, especially given the mother-in-law's difficult nature. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
