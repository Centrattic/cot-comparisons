My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether they're at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details given. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. \n\nThen there's a conflict when the wife brings it up. The author points out that they have a free room but plan to have another child, which makes the space an issue. The wife accuses him of being selfish and not having compassion. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea, comparing it to a prison. \n\nAlso, the wife has been unkind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her and not trying to improve the relationship. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and the mother-in-law's presence would take that away. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is standing his ground because of valid concerns. He's not being cruel for no reason; there's a history of the mother-in-law being difficult. The wife is pushing for this, but her own behavior towards his mother is problematic. The author's reasons seem justified\u2014personal comfort, family planning (another child), and the mother-in-law's personality. \n\nThe key here is whether refusing is selfish. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is offering alternatives like assisted living. The wife, on the other hand, is dismissing those solutions. The author's stance isn't about not caring but about realistic living conditions and his own well-being. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong here. His reasons are legitimate and he's considering future family needs. The answer should be B.\n"
