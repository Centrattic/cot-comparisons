My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his mother-in-law to move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author feels he can't handle living with her because she's difficult and judgmental. He was upfront about his reasons, but his wife called him selfish. He also tried suggesting assisted living, which she rejected. Additionally, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, not even trying to repair that relationship.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid concerns about his own comfort and the potential for family tension. Living with an in-law can be stressful, especially if there are existing strained relationships. He also wants to have another child, which uses up a room and might complicate the living situation further. On the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which raises concerns about her well-being and need for care or companionship.\n\nThe wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer. If she's not trying to improve her relationship with his mother, it might indicate a pattern of not valuing family ties. However, the author's refusal to let his mother-in-law move in could be seen as neglecting her needs, even if he's honest about his reasons.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation for adult children to provide housing for elderly parents unless specified by law or cultural expectations. But culturally, there might be pressure to support aging parents. The author is asserting his right to a comfortable home, which is understandable. However, the wife's loneliness and the mother's isolation are also factors.\n\nThe key points are the author's personal boundaries versus the mother-in-law's needs. The author's reasons are about his own ability to cope, not malice. He's considering future plans (another child) and has offered alternatives (assisted living), though the wife rejected them. The wife's actions might be influencing the situation, but the author is standing his ground.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no clear right or wrong, the author's decision is based on his own well-being and practical considerations. He isn't obligated to host his mother-in-law, especially with the existing tensions. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
