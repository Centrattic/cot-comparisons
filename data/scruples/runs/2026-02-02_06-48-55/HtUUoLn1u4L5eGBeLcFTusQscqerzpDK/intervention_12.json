My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation involves some family dynamics and personal feelings.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in, but the author is reluctant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the wife's mother doesn't get along with his own mother either, leading to past issues like not staying with her during a visit. The author is also planning to have another child, so space is a consideration. He suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate based on the details.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns about his living situation and comfort. He's being honest about his feelings and limitations. The mother-in-law's behavior is described as difficult and judgmental, which could make cohabitation stressful. The author is also considering future family needs with another child.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is that her mother is lonely and needs family support. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her in a time of need. However, the mother-in-law's history of being unkind to the author's own mother complicates things. The author isn't obligated to host someone who has been unkind to his family.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The author is setting boundaries to maintain his home environment, which is reasonable. The wife might need to take more responsibility in addressing her mother's needs through other means, like assisted living or other support systems. The author isn't necessarily being selfish if he's upfront about his limitations and suggests alternatives. His resolve to protect his home and future family plans is understandable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his well-being and family's future, which is a valid consideration. The mother-in-law's actions and the wife's lack of effort in her own relationships also play a role here. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
