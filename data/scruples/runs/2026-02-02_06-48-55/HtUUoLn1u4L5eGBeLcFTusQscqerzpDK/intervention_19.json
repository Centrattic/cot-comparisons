My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The author shares that his wife's mother is in her 70s, lives alone, and the wife has been expressing loneliness. The author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation turned ugly, with the wife accusing him of being selfish. The author also notes that his wife isn't kind to his own mother, which he sees as reinforcing his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has valid reasons based on his personal experience with his mother-in-law. He's concerned about the impact on his family, especially since they plan to have another child. He's offered alternatives like assisted living, which he was met with strong resistance. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother adds context about possible imbalance in how the wife handles her relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, not letting family live with you isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to set boundaries for their home and family life. The author's concerns about his mother-in-law's personality and the potential strain on their household are legitimate. He's also thinking about future family planning, which is a practical consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which might evoke feelings of responsibility or empathy. The wife's perspective is that the author is being selfish, not considering her mother's loneliness. However, the author's response to the wife's mother's judgmental behavior isn't just about being selfish; it's about managing a potentially toxic environment. Also, the wife's own lack of effort in mending her relationship with the author's mother complicates the situation, showing a pattern where the wife may not be fostering good family dynamics.\n\nThe author's resolve is strengthened by the wife's own behavior. He feels his home is just as much his as hers, and he's right to prioritize his comfort and family's well-being. While it's important to support elderly relatives, it's equally important for individuals to maintain their own mental health and family stability. The author isn't refusing without cause; he's making a choice based on his experiences and future plans.\n\nTherefore, considering the context, the author is not in the wrong. He's making a decision that balances his responsibilities and personal well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
