My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife wants her mom to move in because the mother is lonely and in her 70s. The author is resistant because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's worried about the impact on their home, especially since they plan to have another child. The wife is upset, calling him selfish, and there's some history of her not getting along with his own mother. \n\nThe author argues that it's his home too and he should be comfortable there. He suggested assisted living, which the wife rejected. Now, I need to evaluate if he's wrong here.\n\nOn one hand, the wife's mother has a legitimate need for companionship and care. The author's wife is trying to address that, so the author might come off as dismissive. But on the other hand, the author has valid concerns about his own well-being and the family's future. Living with someone difficult can strain a marriage, especially if there's already tension between the wife and his mother.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author was upfront about his reasons, which is important. However, maybe he could have explored other solutions together, like looking at assisted living options the wife is more comfortable with. The fact that the wife has a history of being unkind to his mother complicates things. It might make the author's resistance more understandable, as he's trying to protect his home environment.\n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author isn't being cruel; he's setting boundaries for his family's well-being. However, he could have been more empathetic to his wife's perspective. But given the circumstances, I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong. He's prioritizing his family's comfort and future, which is a valid stance.\n"
