My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. They don't want a long explanation, just a quick A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a person whose wife wants their mother-in-law to move in with them. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife feels she's lonely. The author is against this because the mother-in-law is difficult, judgmental, and he doesn't want to handle living with her. He mentions that his wife has a bad relationship with her own mother and didn't even allow them to stay with her. The author is firm that moving in would make him lose his home comfort.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is standing up for his own comfort and mental health, which is valid. The wife's mother's needs are real, but the author is not in a position to handle it. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother is also mentioned, which adds context to why the author is resistant.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, people often expect adult children to support aging parents. However, the author is not neglecting the mother-in-law; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living. The tension here is between the wife's desire to help her mother and the author's personal boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his limitations and offers alternatives, he's not being selfish. On the other hand, if he were completely dismissive without considering solutions, that might be different. Since he proposed assisted living, even if the wife rejected it, he's trying to address the issue within his comfort zone.\n\nThe fact that the wife has a strained relationship with her own mother complicates things. It might indicate that the wife's push for the mother-in-law to move in is more about her own feelings of guilt or responsibility, not necessarily the mother's well-being. The author's resolve to protect his home and his family's future (planning another child) makes sense.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being honest about your boundaries and not forcing others to overstep them is usually seen as reasonable. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
