My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation got ugly, and the wife accused him of being selfish. The author suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law disagrees. Also, the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which adds to the author's perspective.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is standing his ground on a personal living arrangement. He's not forcing his wife's mother to live alone; he's just not willing to have her in his home. The wife's mother is an adult, so she can make her own decisions. The author is also planning for another child, which uses up the available space. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a rights perspective, the author has the right to his home and should be comfortable there. The mother-in-law isn't a minor, so she can't be forced to live with them. The author's reasons for not wanting her there are personal, but they're valid because it's his home. The wife's judgment about him being selfish might be her opinion, but the decision is ultimately his and his wife's to make. However, since it's a joint decision, maybe there's some nuance if the wife is pushing for it despite his objections. But the author is clear that he's made his stance and is standing by it. \n\nAlso, the wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things. If she's being unkind, maybe the author's resolve is justified. The author isn't denying care or support\u2014he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own living environment and comfort, especially when the mother-in-law isn't in a critical situation requiring immediate family intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
