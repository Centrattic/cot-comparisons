My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should let their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author's main points: They don't want their difficult and judgmental mother-in-law to live with them. They mention that the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is upfront about their reasons, saying they can't handle it and that they plan to have another child. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea. The wife also doesn't get along with the author's mom and refuses to stay with her.\n\nSo, the author is saying they have valid reasons: their own comfort, potential for another child, and the mother-in-law's personality. They also mention that the wife isn't making an effort to improve relationships with the author's mom. The key question is whether the author is being selfish or doing the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which raises concerns about her well-being. Assisted living is an option, but the mother-in-law resists that. The author might be seen as avoiding responsibility by not wanting to take her in. On the other hand, the author has their own family considerations and a strained relationship with the mother-in-law. The wife's behavior towards the author's mom complicates things further, showing that the wife isn't making things easier on either side.\n\nThe author argues that their home should be a place where they feel comfortable. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries, especially if living with someone would cause significant stress. However, there's a balance between personal comfort and family obligations. The author is suggesting alternatives (assisted living), but the mother-in-law sees that as a negative option. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they have legitimate reasons and are considering the whole family's future. However, they might also be seen as not making enough effort to include the mother-in-law in the family, especially if the wife is also contributing to the tension. \n\nBut given the mother-in-law's difficult nature and the wife's role in not repairing relationships, the author's stance might be justified. They're prioritizing their family's well-being and their own mental health. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
