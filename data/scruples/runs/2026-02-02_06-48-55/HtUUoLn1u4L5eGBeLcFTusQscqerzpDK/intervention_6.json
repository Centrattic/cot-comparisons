My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is resistant because they find her difficult and judgmental. When they had the talk, the wife got upset, saying the author is selfish. The author mentions that the wife is also unkind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her even though they're in her hometown. The author feels that their home should be a place where they're comfortable, and they're worried about losing that if the mother-in-law moves in.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in. They cite her being difficult and judgmental. The wife's reaction is emotional, but the author is firm in their stance. Also, there's a history of the wife being unkind to the author's mother, which adds context to the tension.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of family responsibilities versus personal well-being. On one hand, taking in an elderly relative might be seen as a family duty, especially if they're in need. But on the other hand, the author is concerned about their own mental health and home environment. They mention that the wife hasn't made efforts to repair her relationship with the author's mother, which might indicate a pattern of one-sidedness from the wife's side.\n\nThe author is planning for another child, so space is a factor. Suggesting assisted living was a point of contention, but the mother-in-law sees that as worse than prison. The author's position is that they should have a say in their own living situation, as it's their home as much as the wife's.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Or are they protecting their household? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's reasons are based on their personal experience with the mother-in-law's behavior. They're not just saying no without cause. The wife's demands and lack of effort in her own relationships might make the author's stance more defensible.\n\nBut then again, family support is important. The mother-in-law is elderly and alone, which could be a valid concern. However, the author is considering alternative solutions like assisted living, even if the mother-in-law doesn't like them. That shows they're trying to find options, just not the one the wife wants.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. It's a matter of balancing family obligations with personal well-being. Since the author has valid reasons and the wife's behavior isn't helping, perhaps the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
