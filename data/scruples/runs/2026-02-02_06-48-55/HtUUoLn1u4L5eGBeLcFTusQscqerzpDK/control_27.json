My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and their wife is pushing for her to move in. The author is against it because they find her difficult and judgmental. The wife is upset, calling the author selfish. The author mentions that their wife is also not kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her and having a bad relationship with her. The author feels that their home should be comfortable for them, and they don't want the mother-in-law living there because it would make them uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the key points. The author is being honest about their feelings and boundaries. They have valid reasons\u2014finding the mother-in-law hard to live with. The wife is pushing for her to move in, possibly without considering the author's feelings. The author also mentions that their wife isn't kind to his mother, which adds context. The author is not dismissing the mother-in-law's loneliness but is suggesting alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects. \n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often get called out for not being considerate, but in this case, the author is setting boundaries. The wife isn't making an effort to fix her relationship with the author's mother, which might be a red flag. The author's concern about their own well-being and future family planning (another child) is also valid. \n\nHowever, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and alone, which could be seen as needing support. But the author is clear that they can't handle her personality. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a legal or ethical obligation, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and home environment. \n\nThe wife's reaction and her lack of effort with the author's mother might indicate a pattern of behavior. The author is standing up for their own space, which is a reasonable stance. So, in the context of AITA, where people are often judged for not cooperating, but here the author is protecting their own boundaries, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural or other expectations I'm missing. In many cases, family support is expected, but if the author's well-being is at stake, boundaries are justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
