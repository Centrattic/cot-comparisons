My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he tried to be respectful but doesn't think he can handle living with her. He also points out that they have a free room but plan to have another child. The wife got upset, thinking he's selfish and not compassionate. He suggested assisted living, but she rejected that idea, comparing it to prison. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her.\n\nThe author argues it's his home as much as hers, and he should be comfortable there. The key points here are about the dynamics between the couple, their respective family relationships, and the author's right to his living space.\n\nFirst, is the author being selfish? The wife's mother is in a vulnerable situation, but the author has valid reasons for not wanting her to move in. The author is concerned about his own comfort and the future child. However, the wife's stance on her mother's well-being and the author's mother being excluded complicates things. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer isn't straightforward. On one hand, the author has a right to his home and his boundaries. On the other hand, the wife might feel he's not supporting her family's needs. However, the author did consider alternatives like assisted living, which shows some effort to solve the problem. The wife's lack of effort in her own mother-in-law's relationship (the author's mom) might indicate a pattern where the author is reacting to her previous behavior.\n\nIn many cases, family decisions require compromise, but if the author clearly communicates his boundaries and tries to find solutions (like assisted living), maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the wife's perspective is also valid, as she's concerned for her mother's well-being. The author's refusal might be seen as not fully supporting his wife's family needs, but if the living conditions would be harmful for everyone involved (including the author's own mother), then his stance is reasonable.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and individual circumstances. However, since the author is being upfront and considering alternatives, and the wife's own behavior towards the author's mother is problematic, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
