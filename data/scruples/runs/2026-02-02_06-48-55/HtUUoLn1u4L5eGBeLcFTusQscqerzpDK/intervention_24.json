My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is a bit complex. The mother-in-law is alone and in her 70s, which is a concern. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is being upfront about his reasons, which is good. He mentions that the wife has been critical of his mother and even refused to stay with her. That adds context. The author's home is a shared space, so both partners should have a say. However, the mother-in-law's well-being is also a factor. The wife feels that the author is being selfish, but he's concerned about his own comfort and future plans, like having another child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, not allowing a family member to live with them could be seen as not showing compassion, especially for an elderly parent. On the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about his living situation and his relationship with the mother-in-law. The wife's behavior towards the author's mother complicates things further. It might be a two-way issue, but the author's stance is about his own home and well-being. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author is being honest and firm, he might need to explore other solutions for his mother-in-law, like assisted living, which he mentioned. But his refusal isn't necessarily wrong because it's his home. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might also be a point. However, the author's tone could be seen as dismissive or selfish, but given the context, maybe not. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing his ground for his home and personal comfort, even if it's a tough decision. But I'm a bit conflicted because there's a balance between family support and personal boundaries. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
