My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the author explains that the mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and is difficult and judgmental. The wife wants her mom to move in, but the author is against it because he feels he can't handle living with her. He also mentions their plans for another child, which might affect the living space. \n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons: the mother-in-law is hard to be around, and the author's concern about their own family's needs (space for another child). The wife is being critical, calling the author selfish, and the mother-in-law feels the author is cruel for suggesting assisted living. \n\nI need to consider if refusing to have a parent move in is inherently wrong. The author is standing by his own boundaries, which is important. However, there's a family obligation angle, especially since the wife's mother is in need. But the author isn't the one with the strained relationship with the mother-in-law; that's the wife's issue. The author's own mother isn't mentioned being treated well by the wife, but the author is taking a stand for his own household's dynamic. \n\nThe mother-in-law's perspective is also important, but the author is prioritizing his family's well-being. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with her mother might make the author's hesitation more understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the middle ground is expected, but if someone is setting boundaries for their own mental health and family, that's usually seen as justified. The author is clear that he's respectful but can't handle the situation. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because he's maintaining his household's needs and personal comfort.\n"
