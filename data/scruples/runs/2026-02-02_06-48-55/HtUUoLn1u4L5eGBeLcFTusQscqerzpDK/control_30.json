My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. They had a conflict where the author was upfront about his reasons, but the wife thought it was selfish. The author mentions that they have a free room but also plan to have another child, so maybe space is an issue. The wife suggested assisted living, but the author's mother-in-law thinks that's worse than prison. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her when they visit. The author feels that his home is as much his as hers and that living with the mother-in-law would make him uncomfortable.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main argument is about his own comfort and the potential stress of living with someone who's difficult. The wife, on the other hand, is concerned about her mother's well-being. The author also points out the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother, which adds to the tension. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to prioritize one's own well-being and family's space? On one hand, taking in an elderly parent might be seen as a family duty. On the other hand, if the living situation would cause significant stress or conflict, it's understandable to decline. The wife's insistence and the author's discomfort with the mother-in-law's personality are valid points. \n\nThe author is not refusing without any consideration\u2014they mentioned looking into assisted living as an alternative, which shows they want a solution. However, the mother-in-law herself is against those options. The fact that the wife isn't making an effort with the author's mother might indicate a pattern where the wife is prioritizing her own mother's needs over building a relationship with the author's family, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has a right to feel that their home should be a comfortable place for them and their partner. If the mother-in-law's presence would make that impossible, then the author's refusal is justified. It's a balance between family responsibility and personal well-being. The key is whether the author is being selfish without considering alternatives, but he did suggest alternatives, even if they were rejected. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They are asserting their boundaries for their own mental health and family planning. The wife's actions (not staying with the author's mother) and the mother-in-law's difficulty add context that supports the author's stance. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
