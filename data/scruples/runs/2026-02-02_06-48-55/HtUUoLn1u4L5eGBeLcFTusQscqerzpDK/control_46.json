My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, the writer explains that their wife wants her mother to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The writer is resistant because they find the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. They mention that the wife has a poor relationship with her own mother and isn't trying to fix it. The writer also points out that they plan to have another child, so space is a consideration. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea.\n\nThe key points here are the writer's reasons: personal discomfort with their mother-in-law, the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with her mother, and practical considerations like the extra child. The writer is standing their ground, feeling that their home should be comfortable for them as well.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out if they're perceived as being selfish without valid reasons. But in this case, the writer has legitimate concerns. They're not avoiding responsibility entirely\u2014they offered alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law dismissed. Also, the wife's own behavior towards the writer's mother and the lack of effort to mend that relationship might tip the scales in the writer's favor.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family support is important, especially for an elderly parent. But the writer's experience with the mother-in-law being difficult and the wife's own problematic behavior could justify their stance. The home is shared, so both partners' comfort matters. The writer isn't rejecting all responsibility but is prioritizing their own well-being and future family needs.\n\nConsidering all factors, the writer's position seems reasonable. They're not inconsiderate but are setting boundaries based on personal experience and practicality. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
