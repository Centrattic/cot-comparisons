My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. I need to analyze the situation based on the given details.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that the mother-in-law has a poor relationship with the author's own mother, and the wife hasn't made an effort to fix that. The author is planning to have another child, which might require using the extra room. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law doesn't like that idea.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for not allowing the move. They value their home and personal comfort, and they have valid concerns about the mother-in-law's behavior. The wife seems to be pushing this without considering the author's feelings or the existing relationship issues. The author isn't being selfish, they're setting boundaries. They also considered alternatives like assisted living, which shows they're trying to find a solution that's not just about rejecting the idea outright.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law's loneliness is a valid concern, but it's not the author's responsibility to solve that by having her move in if it's going to cause more problems. The wife's lack of effort in her own relationships might be part of the issue here, but the author is standing up for their needs. The author's home is shared, so both should have a say. The author's resolve is strong because they feel their comfort and home life is at stake.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their own well-being and practical considerations, even though it's a difficult situation. The answer should be B.\n"
