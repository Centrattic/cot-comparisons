My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. The wife got upset when he refused, and he offered alternatives like assisted living, which she rejected. Also, the wife isn't kind to his own mother, which the author points out as a reason for his stance.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's discomfort with his mother-in-law's personality, the wife's insistence, and the wife's previous behavior towards the author's mother. The author feels that his home should be a space where he's comfortable, and he doesn't want to compromise that. \n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, there's a balance between family obligations and personal well-being. The author isn't being cruel; he's stating his reasons clearly. He even suggests alternatives, which shows he's trying to be considerate. The wife's mother's loneliness is a valid concern, but the author's mental health and comfort in his own home are also important. \n\nThe wife's behavior towards his own mother adds another layer. If she's unwilling to put effort into her relationship with his mother, maybe it's inconsistent for her to push for her mother's move-in. The author's point about the home being shared and his need for comfort is reasonable. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family support for elderly parents. But the author doesn't owe it to his mother-in-law to host her if it's causing him significant stress. The key here is mutual respect and understanding both sides' perspectives. The author isn't being selfish; he's setting boundaries for his own well-being, which is something people should have the right to do. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. He's justified in his decision based on his comfort and the existing tensions with his wife's family dynamics.\n"
