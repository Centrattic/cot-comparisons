I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by breaking down the details provided.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been expressing loneliness, leading to the discussion about her mother moving in. The author is against it because he finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He's respectful but feels that even a little of her is too much. The conversation got ugly when he was upfront about his reasons. The mother-in-law argues that they have a free room and that assisted living is like prison. The wife also has a bad relationship with the author's mother, not allowing visits. The author feels it's his home too and would lose comfort if she moves in.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reasons are based on his personal comfort and the potential impact on their family dynamics. He mentions planning for another child, which adds to the space issue. He's also considering alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law strongly opposes. The author is standing by his decision, emphasizing that it's his home as much as his wife's.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and living alone, which might raise concerns about her well-being. The wife's comments about loneliness might indicate that she wants to help her mother. However, the author's past experiences with the mother-in-law being difficult and the wife's own estrangement from the author's mother could affect their living situation negatively. The wife's refusal to even visit the author's mother might suggest a pattern of conflict in the family, making the author's stance more about protecting their home environment.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to host his mother-in-law. The decision to let someone live with you is a personal choice. The author's concerns about the mother-in-law's personality and the potential stress it could bring are valid. He's also considering the future with another child, which is a practical concern. The mother-in-law's strong opposition to assisted living might not be the best solution, but the author's alternatives might be what's necessary for the family's mental health.\n\nHowever, the wife's side of the story isn't fully known. If the mother-in-law is truly in need and there are no other options, the author might be seen as prioritizing his comfort over her mother's needs. But given the information, the author is not being unkind; he's being realistic about the situation. The key points are the mother-in-law's difficult nature, the wife's own issues, and the practical aspects of their home. So, I think the author is justified in his decision. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
