My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been talking about how lonely she is, hinting that she wants her mom to move in. The author is against this because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. When they had the talk, it got ugly. The author was upfront, but the wife thinks that's selfish. The mother-in-law's daughter (the wife) says they have a free room and that they're planning another child. The author suggested assisted living, which the wife found terrible. Also, the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, not allowing them to stay with her. The author feels it's his home too and doesn't want to lose comfort.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He's honest about not being able to handle that. He's not denying the mother-in-law's loneliness but suggests alternatives like assisted living. The wife is upset, feeling he's selfish and not compassionate. The author's own relationship with the wife's mother is already strained, and the wife isn't trying to fix that. Also, the author's own mother isn't welcomed by the wife.\n\nThe author's argument is about his comfort and the potential for another child. The wife wants family support but isn't providing reciprocal support for the author's mother. The author is standing his ground, but is that wrong?\n\nPossible angles: Is the author being selfish? Does he have a responsibility to take in his mother-in-law? Is the wife being unreasonable? The author's mother isn't given the same consideration. The author is trying to set boundaries. But maybe he should be more considerate of his wife's feelings and her mother's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to his home and comfort. If the mother-in-law is difficult, forcing her to live together might create more conflict. Assisted living is an option, but the wife rejects that idea. The wife's lack of effort in her own family relationships might indicate a pattern of being self-centered, which could make the author's stance more justified.\n\nBut does that make the author in the right? It's a balance between family support and personal well-being. The author is honest about his limitations. The wife's anger might stem from feeling unfulfilled in her own relationships. The author could be seen as standing up for himself, which is important. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground or communicated better. But given the wife's history with the author's mother, perhaps the author is protecting his own family dynamics.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is not being inconsiderate; he's acknowledging the mother-in-law's loneliness but realistically can't handle living with her. The wife's refusal to consider the author's mother and her own mother's situation might indicate her own issues. The author's resolve seems reasonable given the circumstances. So I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
