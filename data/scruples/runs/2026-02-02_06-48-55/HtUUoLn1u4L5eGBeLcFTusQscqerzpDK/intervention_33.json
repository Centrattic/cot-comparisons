My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the husband is against it because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that the wife has been unkind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her and not making efforts to improve that relationship. The husband feels that if they let the mother-in-law move in, it would affect their plans for another child and his own comfort in the home.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and might need support, which is a valid concern. However, the husband's reasons are that he can't handle living with her, and there's a history of tension with the wife's treatment of his mother. The husband also mentions they have a free room but plan to have another child, which is a practical consideration. It's about balancing family obligations against personal well-being and space. The husband feels strongly about maintaining his home environment, which is understandable. The wife's insistence and the mother-in-law's difficult personality might make the situation untenable. So, the husband isn't being selfish if he's considering his own mental health and future family planning. The fact that the wife hasn't made efforts to improve her relationship with his mother could also affect the dynamics. Therefore, the husband's decision not to let the mother-in-law move in might be justified given the circumstances. Answer B for No.\n"
