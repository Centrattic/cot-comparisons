My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants their 70-year-old mother to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that their wife has a poor relationship with her own mother and won't even stay with the author's mom. The author is worried about their own comfort and future plans, like having another child. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that idea.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries and respect. The author is standing their ground because they feel the mother-in-law would make their life uncomfortable. However, the wife's mother is elderly and possibly in need of care. The wife's actions toward her own mother (refusing to stay with the author's mom and not trying to improve the relationship) might indicate some underlying issues in their family dynamics.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's decision to not let the mother-in-law move in. The author is being honest about their feelings and has valid reasons related to their own well-being and family planning. The mother-in-law's refusal to accept assisted living as a better alternative might be her own issue. The author isn't ignoring the mother's situation but is considering their own circumstances. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted respectfully and with valid reasons. The author seems to have done both. They tried to find an alternative (assisted living) but were met with resistance. The wife's push for the move might be adding stress to an already tense situation. Since the author is clear about their reasons and isn't being malicious, they might not be in the wrong here. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
