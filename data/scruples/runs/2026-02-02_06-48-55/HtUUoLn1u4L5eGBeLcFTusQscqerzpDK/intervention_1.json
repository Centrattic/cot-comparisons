My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their mother-in-law to move in with them. The author's reasons include the mother-in-law being difficult and judgmental, potential future plans for another child, and concerns about their own home environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upfront with their wife about their reasons, which is important. The wife is pushing for the mother-in-law to move in, possibly out of loneliness and to provide care. However, the wife has a history of not being kind to the author's mother, even avoiding interactions by choosing hotels instead of staying with her. This could indicate a pattern of behavior that the author is justifiably wary of when it comes to their own mother-in-law.\n\nThe author mentions that the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a valid concern for her well-being. However, the author is clear that they would lose their comfort in their own home if the mother-in-law moves in. The wife's argument that they have a free room is countered by the author's plans for another child. It's a practical consideration, as a growing family might need more space.\n\nThe wife's reaction, calling the author selfish and suggesting that assisted living is worse than prison, might be an overreaction. The author is also offering alternatives, like assisted living, which is a responsible approach to ensure the mother-in-law's safety and well-being. The wife's refusal to even consider alternatives or make efforts to improve her relationship with the author's mother suggests that her motivations might be more about her own desires than the mother's best interest.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but upon closer examination, the author is being honest about their limitations and is considering the future. They are not ignoring the mother-in-law's needs but are proposing other solutions. The wife's behavior, on the other hand, seems to be driven by personal resentment or a desire for companionship, which might not be the healthiest approach for all parties involved.\n\nIn family dynamics, it's important for all members to feel respected and comfortable. The author is standing their ground to maintain their home environment, which is a valid personal choice. The wife's insistence without considering the author's perspective could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
