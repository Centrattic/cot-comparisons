My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The author's main points are that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and the author feels their home is their space. The wife is pushing for the mother-in-law to move in, and there's some mention of the wife not being kind to the author's own mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. The author is saying they don't want to live with someone who is hard to be around, which is a valid concern. They also mention planning to have another child, so space might be an issue. On the other hand, the wife and mother-in-law might feel that the author is being selfish, especially since the mother is elderly and living alone. The wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother could add to the tension here.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about balancing respect and personal boundaries. The author is upfront about their reasons, which is good. They also offered alternatives like assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejected that. The key here is whether the author's refusal is within their right. Since it's their home, they have the right to decide who lives there. However, the emotional aspect is significant\u2014family dynamics can be complicated. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. If the mother-in-law is in her 70s and alone, there's a concern for her well-being. But the author's comfort and the potential for conflict are also important. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're setting boundaries for their home. They're not being cruel; they're just choosing not to have someone who causes tension. However, maybe there's room for compromise, but the question is about being in the wrong. So I would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
