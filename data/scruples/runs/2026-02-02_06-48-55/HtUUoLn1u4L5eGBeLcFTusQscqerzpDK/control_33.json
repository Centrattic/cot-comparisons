My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed situation. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but finds her hard to handle. The wife thinks he's selfish, and there's been some conflict.\n\nHe also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her. The author feels his home is his space and that moving in the mother-in-law would take that away. He suggests assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is wrong. Let me break down the factors. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern. The wife's loneliness and the mother-in-law's age might make people feel the author should be more accommodating. However, the author's own comfort and the existing tension with his wife's mother are valid. Also, the wife's treatment of his mother could be a red flag, but the author isn't the one responsible for that. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to his home and the potential impact of his mother-in-law's presence on the household. If the mother-in-law is difficult, it could lead to more conflict. The author is upfront about his reasons, which is important. The wife's insistence might not consider the author's perspective. \n\nAssisted living was suggested, but the wife dismissed it. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's mother's situation. However, given the mother-in-law's personality, it's a practical decision. Also, the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might affect how the author perceives the situation, but that's more about the wife's actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. There's no absolute right or wrong here. However, the author is being honest about his boundaries. Since it's his home and he's explaining his reasons without being disrespectful, it's more about personal boundaries. The wife's perspective is valid too, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate if it causes him significant distress. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
