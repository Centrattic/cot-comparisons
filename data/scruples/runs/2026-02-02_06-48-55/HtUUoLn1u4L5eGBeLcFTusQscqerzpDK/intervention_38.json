My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the writer's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife has been talking about her loneliness, and the writer is against her moving in because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. They had a conflict when discussing it, and the wife accused him of being selfish. The writer suggests assisted living, but the mother-in-law rejects that idea. Also, the wife isn't kind to the writer's own mother, not even allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown. The writer feels this strengthens his resolve to keep his home as his own.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The writer is standing his ground on a personal boundary. He's explaining his reasons, which include his own comfort and future plans (another child). The mother-in-law's insistence and the wife's harsh treatment of his mother add context. But the main issue is whether not allowing the mother-in-law to move in is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the writer has a right to his living space and to feel comfortable. He's not obligated to take someone in if he finds it unbearable. On the other hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and alone, and the wife is pushing for her to move in. However, the wife's behavior towards the writer's mother complicates things. If the wife isn't making efforts to maintain her own relationships, maybe the writer isn't entirely responsible for the mother-in-law's situation either.\n\nThe key points are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The writer is clear about his stance, and while it may be difficult for the mother-in-law and wife, the writer isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his own well-being and family planning. The wife's actions might be contributing to the tension. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that he's being upfront and has valid reasons, I think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
