My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife is pushing for her to move in. The husband is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife has a bad relationship with her own mother, even to the point of not allowing them to stay with her. The husband argues that they have a free room but also plan to have another child. He suggested assisted living, which the wife rejected.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband's reasons for not wanting the mother-in-law to move in are about his own comfort and the potential stress from her personality. On the other hand, the wife is concerned about her mother's loneliness and wants her to live with family. The husband feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and he's worried about losing that if the mother-in-law comes. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, people often have different opinions on in-law living arrangements. Some might argue that family should support each other, especially in times of need, like aging parents. Others might say that a couple's home is their own, and they have the right to decide who lives there without pressure. \n\nThe wife's behavior towards the husband's mother (refusing to stay with her) adds another layer. The husband points out the hypocrisy, which could make his stance seem more justified. However, the main issue is whether his refusal to let his mother-in-law in is wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is being upfront about his reasons. He's not hiding his feelings and has proposed alternatives like assisted living. His wife, however, is dismissive of those solutions. The husband's concern about the impact on their family planning (another child) is a practical consideration. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say he's being selfish for not considering his wife's mother's well-being, while others might say he's standing up for his own living environment. Since there's no clear right or wrong, but the husband's reasons are valid and he's not being cruel, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong). The mention of his wife's poor relationship with her own mother also supports his resolve, suggesting that the wife's demands might be more about her own issues than genuine concern for her mother. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
