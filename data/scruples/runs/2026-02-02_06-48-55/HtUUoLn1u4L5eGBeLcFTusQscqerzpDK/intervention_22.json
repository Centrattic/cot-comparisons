My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that his mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in, but the author feels that she's difficult and judgmental. He's concerned about handling the situation and also planning to have another child. The wife gets upset, calls him selfish, and the author suggests assisted living, which the wife rejects. Also, the author's wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, which adds to his perspective.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key factors here. The author is making a personal choice about his living situation. While the mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, the author is entitled to set boundaries in his home. He's not in a position where he's refusing to help entirely\u2014he's proposing alternatives like assisted living. The wife's resistance to those options and her own lack of effort in her relationship with the author's mother might indicate that the tension isn't entirely the author's fault. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is being honest about his feelings and the potential impact on their family dynamics. It's reasonable for him to prioritize his own comfort and the family's future. The wife's judgment of him as selfish might be misguided, especially if she's not making efforts to accommodate the author's family. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a responsibility to care for elderly relatives. However, the author isn't neglecting his mother-in-law; he's suggesting alternatives. The fact that the wife isn't reciprocating in her relationship with the author's mother complicates the matter. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's expressing his needs and limitations, which is valid. The main conflict arises from differing viewpoints and the wife's inability to compromise or understand his perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
