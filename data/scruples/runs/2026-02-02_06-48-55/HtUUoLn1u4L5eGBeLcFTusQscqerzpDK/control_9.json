My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they did the right thing by not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the user provided the story where the author's wife wants the mother-in-law to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, and they also plan to have another child. The wife gets upset, thinking the author is selfish. The author offers alternatives like assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, what factors should I consider? Well, the key points are the author's reasons for not letting her in. They mention that the mother-in-law is hard to handle, and they want to have another child. It's important to respect the author's comfort and the household dynamics. On the other hand, the wife is pushing for her mom to move in, maybe out of genuine concern for her mother's loneliness. But the author is clear that it's not about not caring; they suggested alternatives.\n\nIn many cases, family situations like this are complex. The author is being upfront about their feelings and boundaries. They are not forcing the mother-in-law out without options but are considering other solutions. The wife's resentment might be part of the issue, especially since she has a strained relationship with the author's own mother. However, the author's stance seems reasonable given their own family plans and the potential stress of living with someone difficult.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they are asserting their right to a comfortable home, especially when there are valid concerns about the mother-in-law's behavior and future family plans. It's a personal decision that affects their household, and they aren't ignoring the mother-in-law's needs entirely by suggesting alternatives. The answer should be B, No.\n"
