My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The key points here are his reasons: he finds his mother-in-law difficult, judgmental, and that living with her would make him uncomfortable. He also mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother and that there's a conflict there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which might make people feel he should be more accommodating. However, the user is upfront about his reasons and is concerned about the impact on their home, especially with plans for another child. He also suggests alternatives like assisted living, which shows he's trying to be considerate. His wife's behavior towards his mother adds another layer, possibly justifying his stance since the wife isn't making efforts in other family relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law feels rejected and the wife is upset, thinking he's being selfish. The user might be seen as not showing enough compassion, but he's standing by his decision for valid personal reasons. It's a balance between family obligations and personal well-being. Since he's honest and has plans for the extra room, it's not entirely his fault. The wife's own issues complicating things might shift some blame away from him. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
