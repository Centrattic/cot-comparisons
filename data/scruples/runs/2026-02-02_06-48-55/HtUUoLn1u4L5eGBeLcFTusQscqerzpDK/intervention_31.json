My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the person should let their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone, which is a valid concern. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is against it because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they are planning to have another child, so space might be an issue. They also suggested assisted living, which the wife rejected.\n\nThe author's wife is being critical of the author's stance, calling it selfish. On the other hand, the author points out that the wife isn't kind to the author's own mother, like not wanting to stay at their home. That seems like a point the author is using to justify their position.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics, there's a balance between respecting a spouse's wishes and personal boundaries. The author is expressing their discomfort with living with an in-law, which is a personal boundary. However, the wife's mother might need support, and the wife feels it's important for them to provide that. \n\nThe author's argument that the home is a shared space and they should feel comfortable is valid. But is it wrong to not want to take in a family member in need? It's a tough call. The key points are mutual respect and communication. The author was upfront, even if the conversation got ugly. The wife might feel neglected or that their family obligations are being ignored. \n\nThe fact that the wife isn't reciprocating kindness towards the author's mother might make the author feel justified. However, that doesn't necessarily exonerate the author from considering their mother-in-law's needs. \n\nIn the end, whether it's right or wrong could depend on cultural expectations, the specific dynamics of their relationship, and how the decision is handled. But the author is stating their position based on personal well-being and future family plans, which are legitimate concerns. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, since they have valid reasons and communicated their stance.\n"
