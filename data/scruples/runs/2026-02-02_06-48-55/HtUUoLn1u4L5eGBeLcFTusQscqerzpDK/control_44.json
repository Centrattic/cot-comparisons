My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The situation is that the mother-in-law is in her 70s, living alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author is against it because they find the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental, and they also want to use the room for a potential future child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mention that the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental, which could make living together stressful. The author also wants space for a new child, which is a valid family planning consideration. However, not letting an elderly parent move in with their child can be seen as a lack of support, especially if the parent is isolated.\n\nBut the author is also concerned about their own comfort and the existing dynamics. The wife has a poor relationship with the author's mother and hasn't tried to mend it. The author feels that their home should be a comfortable place, and they might lose that with the mother-in-law moving in. \n\nThe wife is arguing that they have a free room and that assisted living is worse than family. The author counters that by suggesting alternatives, but the mother-in-law rejects those. The author's position is that they can't handle the living arrangement due to personality conflicts.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to have their mother-in-law live with them, especially if it's going to cause significant stress. However, refusing without considering other solutions might be seen as selfish. But the author does mention looking into assisted living, which is a valid alternative. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to their own home's comfort, the wife's pressure, and the mother-in-law's needs. Since the author has valid reasons related to their own family's future and their own well-being, it's a complex situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have legitimate concerns about their living situation and family planning. The mother-in-law's needs are important, but so is the author's right to a comfortable home.\n"
