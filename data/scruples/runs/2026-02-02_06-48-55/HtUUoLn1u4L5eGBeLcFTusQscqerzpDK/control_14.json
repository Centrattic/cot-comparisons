My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should let their mother-in-law move in with them. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for not allowing that.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their mother-in-law is in her 70s, lives alone, and their wife is concerned she's lonely. The author is resistant because they find the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. They were upfront about their reasons, but the wife felt it was selfish. The author also points out that they have a free room but plan to have another child, so space is an issue. They suggested assisted living, but the mother-in-law compared that to prison and insisted on living with family.\n\nThe author also mentions that the wife isn't kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay during a visit and refusing to improve their relationship. He feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable, and having the mother-in-law move in would take that away.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key points are: the mother-in-law's needs vs. the author's comfort, the wife's behavior towards his mother, and the space for another child. \n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law's situation is concerning\u2014loneliness, aging, and needing support. The wife might feel she's not getting enough family support. The author's suggestion of assisted living might be seen as cost-effective but could be invalid if the mother-in-law strongly opposes it. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns about his living conditions and his own mother's treatment by his wife. His right to feel comfortable in his own home is a consideration.\n\nBut the author's refusal might seem harsh if the mother-in-law needs help. However, he's being honest about his limitations. The wife's behavior towards his mother complicates things, possibly indicating a pattern of prioritizing her mother over his. The author might be justified in setting boundaries to protect his own family's well-being. However, there's a responsibility to consider the mother-in-law's needs, but maybe not at the expense of his own family's situation. \n\nIt's a tough balance. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his family's space and his comfort, especially given the wife's past actions. But maybe there's another solution, but he's stated he can't handle her. So, considering all factors, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
