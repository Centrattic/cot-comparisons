My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided. The author's mother-in-law is 70, lives alone, and the wife wants her to move in. The author finds her difficult and judgmental, and he's concerned about future plans for another child. The wife is upset, thinking he's selfish, and the author suggests assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break down the key points.\n\n1. **The Author's Perspective**: He feels his home is his as much as his wife's. He's worried about the mother-in-law's personality affecting their household. He mentions future plans for another child, which might mean space is an issue. He's also concerned about his own relationship with his wife's mother, as she's been unkind to his mom and didn't let them stay with her.\n\n2. **The Wife's Perspective**: She's worried about her mother's loneliness and wants to provide care. She feels the author is being selfish by not considering her mother's needs. She thinks assisted living is worse, implying family should take care of her.\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Family dynamics can be complex. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to live with his mother-in-law, especially if she's difficult. However, the wife's mother needs support, and the author is part of a family unit that might be expected to help. But does that obligation override the author's comfort and future plans?\n\n4. **Possible Biases**: The user might be leaning towards A (author in the wrong), but I need to remain neutral. The author is upfront about his reasons, which shows he's not being passive-aggressive. He's also considering alternatives (assisted living), but the mother-in-law rejects that. The wife's actions towards the author's own mother add context\u2014maybe she's not entirely blameless.\n\n5. **Legal/Ethical Standpoint**: There's no legal obligation to house a parent-in-law unless specified. The decision is personal. The author's right to a comfortable home is a factor. However, the wife's needs and the mother's well-being are also important. But if the author can't handle the situation emotionally, it's a valid reason to say no.\n\n6. **Conflict Resolution**: The author tried to discuss it upfront, which is good. The wife's response being \"ugly\" suggests miscommunication. The author's resolve is strengthened by the wife's lack of effort in his own family relationships, which might be a point in his favor as justification for his stance.\n\n7. **Final Judgment**: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a personal choice based on his comfort and family planning. However, the situation is nuanced. The mother-in-law's well-being is a concern, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own happiness. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest and has valid reasons, especially with future children in mind. But it's a close call depending on cultural expectations of family support.\n"
