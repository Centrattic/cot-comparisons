My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because he finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that his wife isn't kind to his own mother either, which might influence his decision. They also plan to have another child, so space is a consideration. The wife reacts negatively, saying assisted living is like prison and the author is selfish for not letting her mom come. \n\nNow, the key points here are the author's reasons: his mother-in-law is hard to be around, they have a free room but also future plans for a child, and the wife's own behavior towards his mom. The author feels that his home should be comfortable for him as much as his wife, so taking in his difficult mother-in-law would affect that.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, personal boundaries, and the validity of the author's concerns. On one hand, family support is important, and not allowing a parent to live with you might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, the author's well-being and the home environment matter too. If the mother-in-law is toxic, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize his mental health. Also, the wife's lack of effort in her relationship with his mother might justify his stance.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to say he's in the wrong? He did offer alternatives like assisted living. Was that a mistake? The mother-in-law rejected that. The author is upfront about his reasons, so maybe he's not wrong. The wife's reaction might be emotional, but the author has valid reasons. However, there's a balance. If the mother is alone, maybe the son-in-law has some responsibility. But in many cultures, a husband isn't expected to take in his wife's parents unless they agree. The wife's role is key here since she's the one pushing for her mother to move in. The author is asserting his right to his home's atmosphere.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a choice based on his personal comfort and future family plans. His wife's criticism might be unfair, especially given her own behavior towards his mother. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
