My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the person should have let their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the user (the author) is in a situation where his wife wants her mom to move in because she's lonely and in her 70s. The author is against it because he finds the mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. The wife got upset, calling him selfish. The author also brings up that they plan to have another child and have a spare room, but the mother-in-law thinks assisted living is bad. \n\nThen there's some context about the wife not being kind to his own mother, not allowing them to stay with her when visiting his hometown. The author feels that his home should be a place where he's comfortable.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law is elderly and possibly in need of support. The wife is concerned about her mother's loneliness. The author is being honest about his feelings towards the mother-in-law, which might be seen as not supportive of the wife's needs. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to live with someone who is difficult. The wife's lack of effort towards his mother might also be a factor in the author's resolve.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and the right to a comfortable home. The author is upfront about his reasons, which is honest. However, the wife might feel unappreciated or feel that he's not supporting her family. But the author's own experience with the wife's inconsiderate behavior towards his mother could be justifying his stance. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, I think it's more about personal boundaries and mutual understanding. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he has a right to his comfort and to set boundaries. The wife might need to consider his feelings as well. The author isn't being cruel, just honest. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
