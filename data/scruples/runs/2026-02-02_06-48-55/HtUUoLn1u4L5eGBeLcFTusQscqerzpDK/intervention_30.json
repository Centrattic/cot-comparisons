My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his mother-in-law move in with them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author's mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. His wife wants her to move in because she's lonely. The author is against it because he finds his mother-in-law difficult and judgmental. He mentions that he's respectful but can't handle living with her. He also points out that they have plans for another child, so space is an issue. When discussing this, the wife got upset and accused him of being selfish. The author suggested assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejected, comparing it to prison. Additionally, the wife has a poor relationship with the author's mother, not even visiting her.\n\nHmm, the author is standing his ground because he wants his home to be comfortable. But on the other hand, the wife's mother is in a vulnerable position. The author's reasons are based on personal discomfort and practical considerations like space. But is that a valid reason? Also, the wife's behavior towards the author's mother complicates things. Maybe the author is justified because he's not responsible for fixing his wife's relationship issues. However, not allowing the mother-in-law to move in could leave her without support. But the author's own comfort and future family planning (another child) are factors. \n\nThe key points are the mother-in-law's well-being versus the author's personal and family needs. The author isn't being cruel; he's making a firm decision. The wife's actions towards the author's mother might indicate that the wife isn't putting in effort, which could affect the mother-in-law's potential move. The author's resolve seems reasonable given these points. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
