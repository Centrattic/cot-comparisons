My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife wants her 70-year-old mom to move in. The author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions they have a free room but are planning to have another child. The wife is upset, feeling the author lacks compassion. The author also notes that the wife is unkind to his own mother, which might add to his discomfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the points. The mother-in-law is alone and needs care, which is a valid concern. However, the author has valid reasons too. Living with someone difficult can cause a lot of stress. The author is trying to balance their own mental health and family planning. The wife's previous behavior towards the author's mom might make the situation more tense. The author suggests alternatives like assisted living, which the mother-in-law rejects, but the author isn't obligated to agree with her views. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation for adult children to support their parents unless specified by law, which varies. Emotionally and ethically, it's a tough spot. The author's right to a comfortable home versus the mother-in-law's need for care. The author isn't being uncompassionate by suggesting alternatives. It's about personal boundaries and family dynamics. The wife's behavior might be contributing to the conflict, but the author's stance is about their own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate concerns about their living situation and mental health. The answer should be B.\n"
