My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law is alone and in her 70s. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because he finds her difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that he's been respectful but can't handle living with her. The conversation turned ugly when he was upfront about his reasons. The wife argues that they have a free room and could use assisted living, but the mother-in-law thinks those places are like prison. The author also notes that the wife has a poor relationship with his own mother and won't make an effort to improve it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's discomfort with the mother-in-law's personality, his wife's insistence, the wife's own family dynamics (her lack of effort with his mom), and the author's right to feel comfortable in their home.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider typical family expectations. In many cultures, adult children are expected to care for their aging parents, but that can vary. The author is not the child of the mother-in-law; he's the spouse. So, the question is whether the wife is placing an unreasonable expectation on him to accommodate her mother, especially when it affects their living situation and future plans (like having another child). \n\nThe author argues that it's his home as much as hers, and he has a right to feel comfortable. On the other hand, the wife might feel that family support is important, especially for elderly parents. The mother-in-law's perspective is also that family is more reliable than assisted living. \n\nBut the author's wife isn't even making an effort with his mother, which could imply a double standard. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish if it's about his comfort versus his wife's mother's needs. However, if the mother-in-law is difficult, it's also a valid reason for the author to not want to live with her. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are justified. Since he's not the one with the parental responsibility (he's the husband, not the son), his right to his own home's environment is a factor. However, supporting a spouse's parent is a common expectation in some contexts, so refusing might be seen as inconsiderate. The wife's lack of effort with his mother adds complexity, possibly justifying his stance more. \n\nBut the author's wife is the one who initiated the request, and the author is being honest about his feelings. If he's being respectful and offering alternatives (like assisted living), maybe he's not in the wrong. The conflict is more about differing priorities and expectations in the marriage rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for his own comfort and the home they share. But some might argue A if they believe family responsibilities should take precedence. However, since the author is not the parent of the mother-in-law, his obligation is not as direct. The wife's expectations might be unreasonable, especially since she's not reciprocating with her mother-in-law. \n\nFinal thought: The author is in the right to prioritize his own well-being and family planning, so B."
