My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their mother-in-law move in with them. \n\nFirst, the mother-in-law is 70 and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author finds her difficult and judgmental. He's upfront about his reasons, but the wife sees it as selfish. The author mentions they have a free room but plan to have another child, so space is a consideration. The wife pushes back against assisted living, calling it worse than prison. Also, the author notes that the wife isn't kind to his own mother and didn't want to stay with her, which makes him more resolved.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author is being honest about his feelings towards his mother-in-law, which is important. He's not ignoring her needs; he's suggesting alternatives like assisted living. The wife's actions towards his mother add another layer\u2014maybe showing inconsistency. But the main issue is the mother-in-law's request. The author is prioritizing his comfort and the family's future (another child) over the wife's wishes. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own well-being in a shared home? In relationships, both partners need to consider each other's comfort. If the mother-in-law is difficult, it's reasonable to say it's not feasible. However, the wife's perspective is that the author lacks compassion. But the author is offering alternatives. The key points are honesty, consideration of future needs, and the wife's own behavior towards his mother. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's being upfront and has valid reasons. The wife's insistence might be more about her own feelings of guilt or loneliness than the mother's actual needs. The answer is B.\n"
