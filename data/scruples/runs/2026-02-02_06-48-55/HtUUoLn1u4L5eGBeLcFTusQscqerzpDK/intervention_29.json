My wife has been making comments about how lonely she\u2019s been and right away I knew what was coming, but I really don\u2019t think I would be able to handle living with her.  She is a very difficult and judgmental woman.  I\u2019ve always been respectful, but seriously a little bit of her goes a long way.   \n\nWhen we actually had \u2018the talk\u2019 about her moving in it got ugly pretty quick.  I was upfront about my reasons, but apparently that\u2019s selfish.  She mentioned that we have a free room, but we are also planning on having another child at some point as well.  She thinks I have no compassion for her mother\u2019s situation and I told her that that\u2019s not true and we could look into assisted living places.  That was a mistake.  She said those places are a step above prison and how could I even consider sending her mother there when she could be with family. \n\nMy wife has been less than kind to my own mother.  She wouldn\u2019t even allow us to stay with her when we went to my home town.  She insisted we get a hotel because she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her and refuses to put even the tiniest effort into repairing that relationship.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a tit for tat though, it really just makes my resolve about the situation a little stronger.  This is my home as much as hers and I should be comfortable here.   If her mother were to come live with us I would lose that.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is being asked if they're at fault for not letting their mother-in-law move in. The mother-in-law is in her 70s and lives alone. The wife wants her to move in, but the author is resistant because the mother-in-law is difficult and judgmental. The author mentions that they tried to explain their reasons, but the conversation got ugly. The wife feels it's selfish, and the author points out they could look into assisted living, but the wife rejects that idea. Also, the wife has a bad relationship with the author's mother, which the author feels strengthens their resolve.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother-in-law's well-being. She's in her 70s, lives alone, and the wife feels she's lonely. The author is concerned about their own comfort and the potential for conflict. They mention that the mother-in-law is difficult, so it's understandable that they don't want to take her in. However, the wife's perspective is that family support is important and that assisted living is akin to \"prison.\" The author is caught between their mother-in-law's needs and their own boundaries.\n\nFamily dynamics are tricky here. The author's refusal isn't out of a lack of compassion, as they suggest looking into other options. But the wife sees it as selfish. The author also points out that they're planning another child, which might affect space. The wife's own behavior towards the author's mother adds another layer\u2014maybe the author feels justified in not wanting to have more family conflicts at home.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, not wanting to live with a difficult relative is a personal choice. People have the right to their own living space and comfort. On the other hand, there's a social expectation to support aging family members. However, the author isn't refusing support entirely\u2014they're considering alternatives like assisted living. The wife's judgment of the author as selfish might be harsh, especially since the author is not ignoring the mother-in-law's situation entirely.\n\nThe wife's actions, like not allowing the author to stay with his mother, could be seen as contributing to the tension. The author's resolve is strengthened by her behavior, which might indicate that the wife isn't exactly fostering a cooperative environment. The author's stance is about maintaining their home's comfort, which is a valid concern. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries, especially when there's a history of conflict. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonably selfish or just asserting their own needs. Since they're open to other solutions, it's more about personal boundaries than neglect.\n"
