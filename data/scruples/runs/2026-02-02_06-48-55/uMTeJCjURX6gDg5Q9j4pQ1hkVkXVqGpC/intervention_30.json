In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who bullied his sibling in childhood and now the sibling hasn't forgiven him. The author is frustrated that after 10 years, their brother is still holding a grudge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully, specifically teasing their brother about anime and video games. They claim it wasn't malicious, but the brother ended up crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. Now, the brother confronts the author, and the author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nSo the main issues here are: 1) Did the author do something wrong in the past? 2) Is the author in the wrong for being angry at their brother for not letting go of the past?\n\nFor the first point, even if the author didn't mean harm, teasing someone to the point where they cry and feel like a \"weirdo\" can be harmful. Bullying isn't just about physical actions; emotional and verbal can be just as damaging. The fact that the brother was affected this much suggests the author's actions had negative consequences.\n\nSecond, the author is upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The brother's reaction seems valid because the emotional impact lasted years. The author might think the teasing was harmless, but if it caused long-term emotional distress, the brother's feelings are justified. The author's frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings could indicate a lack of understanding of the lasting effects of their actions.\n\nAlso, the brother's current popularity and confidence don't negate the past trauma. People can have different experiences in different life stages. The brother might have built up resilience later, but the childhood experiences still left a mark. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might come off as dismissive, not taking responsibility for the harm caused.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have acknowledged the harm, apologized sincerely, and made efforts to repair the relationship. The fact that they're still defensive (\"what I teased him about was never that bad\") shows a lack of taking accountability. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't diminished by the author's intentions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, even if unintentional, caused significant emotional harm. Their current frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings shows a failure to take responsibility and understand the long-term impact. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
