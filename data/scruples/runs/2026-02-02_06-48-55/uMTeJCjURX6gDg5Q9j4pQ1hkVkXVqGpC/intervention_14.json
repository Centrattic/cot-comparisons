In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after their brother still hasn't forgiven them for teasing him as a child. The author is upset that their brother is holding a grudge after 10 years and thinks the teasing wasn't that bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author admits they were a bit of a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about anime, which was a hobby the brother was into. The brother felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep because of the teasing, which the author didn't realize. Now, after a decade, the brother confronts the author, and the author is angry that their brother hasn't moved on.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt their brother, but their actions did cause emotional harm. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, the effect it had on the brother is real. The brother feeling like a weirdo and crying shows that the teasing was more hurtful than the author realized. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction to the brother's anger is important. Instead of acknowledging the harm, they seem to dismiss it by saying the brother should have moved on. The author is angry that the brother hasn't let go, but they don't take responsibility for their part in the situation. \n\nIn relationships, especially between family members, how we handle past issues matters. The author could have reached out earlier to apologize and make amends. The fact that the brother is still upset after 10 years might indicate that the wounds are deep, and the author's lack of remorse or effort to reconcile could be the issue here. \n\nHowever, the brother's response is also extreme in holding a grudge for so long. But the question is about the author's actions. Even if the brother is overreacting, the author's teasing caused harm, so there's a responsibility there. The author's anger at the brother not letting go might stem from not taking full ownership of their actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because their actions had a negative impact, even if unintended, and their reaction to the brother's hurt is dismissive rather than empathetic. They haven't taken steps to address the issue properly, leading to ongoing damage in their relationship. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
