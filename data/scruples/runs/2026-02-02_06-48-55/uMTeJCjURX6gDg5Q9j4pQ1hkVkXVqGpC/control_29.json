In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who was teased for liking anime and now, years later, the other brother is annoyed that he hasn't forgiven him. The author says they didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to sleep upset, but the brother still holds a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author admits to being a bully through teasing about anime, but claims it wasn't malicious. The brother was affected deeply, crying himself to sleep and feeling like a weirdo. Now, the author is angry that after 10 years, the brother hasn't forgiven him. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong for their childhood behavior or for being angry now. Let's break it down. Bullying, even if not malicious, is still harmful. Teasing about someone's hobbies can lead to feelings of embarrassment and low self-esteem. The brother's reaction shows that it had a lasting negative impact. The author might have thought the teasing wasn't a big deal, but the brother clearly felt it was. \n\nThe author is now 26 and still hasn't made amends. The brother's response at the birthday was probably a culmination of years of hurt. The author might feel justified because they think the teasing wasn't that bad, but the key here is the effect it had on the brother. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the actions still caused pain, which makes them at least partially responsible. \n\nAs for the author being annoyed at the brother for not forgiving, that's another angle. Not everyone can let go of past hurts easily. The brother has the right to feel upset if the teasing was harmful. The author's anger might stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt or feeling that the brother should move on. However, the author's current reaction could be seen as dismissive of the brother's feelings. \n\nSo, the author's initial actions (teasing) were wrong because they were bullying, even if not malicious. The current annoyance with the brother's lack of forgiveness might be lessening the impact of their actions. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their past behavior was harmful, and their current reaction doesn't take into account the lasting effect on their brother.\n"
