In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who's upset that his sibling hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger. \n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child and making fun of his brother's interests. Even though he didn't mean it maliciously, the brother was deeply affected, crying and feeling embarrassed. Now, even after years, the brother hasn't let it go, leading the author to feel angry because he thinks it's time to move on.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's past behavior and his current reaction. The author acknowledges that his teasing was harmful, even if not intended. The brother's emotional response was significant, and the author's current anger is towards his brother for not forgiving him after a long time.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for his past actions. Even if it was not malicious, bullying is wrong and can have lasting effects. However, the brother's refusal to forgive after years might also be a point, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's current reaction of being angry at his brother for not moving on could be seen as not taking responsibility for his past actions. Instead of understanding his brother's feelings, he's upset that the brother hasn't let go. That might indicate he's not fully owning up to his mistakes.\n\nSo, considering both the past actions and the current reaction, the author might be in the wrong because he was a bully (even if not malicious) and is now angry at the brother for being hurt. The brother's response is about past trauma, which is valid, and the author's anger is misplaced. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
