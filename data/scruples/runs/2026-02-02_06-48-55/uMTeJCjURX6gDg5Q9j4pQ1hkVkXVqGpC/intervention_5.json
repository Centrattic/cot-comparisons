In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing their brother about anime during their childhood and young teens, and now the brother hasn't forgiven them even years later. The author feels annoyed that their brother is still upset and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. They admitted to being a bully, but claim it wasn't malicious. However, bullying, even if not intended, can have lasting effects. The key points here are the impact on the brother. The brother was teased about his hobbies, which made him feel embarrassed and led to crying himself to sleep. Even if the author thought it was harmless teasing, the effect on the brother was real and significant. \n\nThe author mentions that they never meant any of it maliciously and didn't let the brother go to bed upset. But the brother's experience was different\u2014he felt that his teenage years were miserable, and the teasing made him feel like a \"weirdo.\" The author might not have seen the harm, but the emotional damage is there. \n\nNow, considering the current situation: the brother is still hurt after 10 years and confronted the author. The author is angry that the brother hasn't let go, but the brother's feelings are valid. The author's reaction to being upset that the brother is still holding a grudge might be part of the issue. They might not be taking full responsibility for their actions, instead being defensive about their behavior as a child. \n\nThe author's justification is that they didn't mean to be cruel and that the brother is now more accepted in university. However, that doesn't negate the brother's past pain. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. The fact that they got the brother a present but the brother still felt conflicted shows that the emotional wound is still there. \n\nThe brother's reaction is a valid expression of his hurt, and while it's unfortunate that the relationship is strained, the author's actions as a child contributed to that. The author needs to take responsibility for their past behavior, even if it was unintentional. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their past actions or their current anger. Since the original question is about the past behavior, the answer would hinge on whether the teasing constituted bullying and if it caused harm. \n\nGiven that the brother was affected deeply and the author's actions, even if not malicious, were hurtful and contributed to the brother's feelings of being a \"weirdo,\" the author is in the wrong. Their current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings suggests a lack of acknowledgment of the harm caused. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
