In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a brother who, as a child and young teen, teased his brother about his anime interests. He claims he didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to bed upset. But now, when he's 26 and his brother 23, the brother hasn't forgiven him and expressed deep hurt, saying he cried himself to sleep because of the teasing. The author is upset that his brother hasn't moved on after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the actions of the author as a child. Bullying can be tricky because sometimes people don't realize the impact of their actions. The author says he teased his brother about anime, which his brother was into. Even if it wasn't malicious, the fact that it caused emotional harm is important. The brother felt embarrassed and cried, which is significant. The author now feels angry that his brother hasn't let it go.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he was a child himself and might not have realized how hurtful his words were. On the other hand, the impact on his brother was real and long-lasting. The brother's reaction shows that the teasing had lasting emotional effects. The author's defense is that he didn't mean harm, but intent matters less than the actual harm caused. \n\nAlso, the author is now upset about his brother's lack of forgiveness. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of how serious the issue was for his brother. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author might need to take responsibility for the pain he caused, regardless of his intent. \n\nSo, considering the harm done and the fact that the author didn't see the depth of the issue until confronted, it seems like the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
