In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their brother not forgiving them for bullying as a child.\n\nFirst, the author admits to teasing their brother about anime, which the brother was into. They say they never meant it maliciously and didn't let him go to bed upset. But the brother now reveals that he was crying himself to sleep because of the teasing. That's a big deal. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the effect on the brother was real and emotional.\n\nThe author is annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years. They think the teasing wasn't that bad and are angry that their brother is holding a grudge. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent might have been playful teasing, but the impact caused significant emotional pain. \n\nThe brother's reaction is valid because he felt embarrassed and isolated in his interests. Even if others later accepted him, the author's actions as a sibling, who should be a supportive figure, contributed to that distress. Siblings have a duty to support each other, not make each other feel like outcasts. The fact that the brother is still upset after a decade shows the lasting effect of those actions. \n\nThe author is now angry that the brother isn't over it, but that's ignoring the depth of the emotional trauma. The brother is justified in needing time to process and heal. The author's frustration doesn't negate the brother's experience. So, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions were indeed harmful, making them at least partially responsible. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their teasing, even if not malicious, caused lasting harm and they're not taking full responsibility for the impact.\n"
