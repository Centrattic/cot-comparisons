In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for being a bully as a child. The situation is that the author used to tease their younger brother about his anime hobby, but now, even after years, the brother still holds a grudge and confronted them on their birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was actually a bully. They mention teasing their brother about his hobbies, specifically anime. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author claims they didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to bed upset. However, the brother felt so affected that he would cry himself to sleep and felt like a \"weirdo.\" Even though the author might not have intended harm, the effect on the brother was negative. That's a red flag. Bullying isn't always about physical harm; emotional and psychological effects matter too.\n\nNext, the time frame. The brother is 23 now, and the teasing took place during his childhood and teenage years. The author is 26, so it's been around 10 years since the incidents. The brother's reaction now is significant because even if the behavior stopped, the lingering effects can last into adulthood. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt they caused, but that doesn't negate the fact that their actions had a lasting impact.\n\nThe author's current frustration is about the brother not letting go of the past. They feel angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them and that it's affecting their relationship. But here's the catch: the brother's feelings of embarrassment and being made to feel like a weirdo could have contributed to long-term emotional issues. The author might be in the wrong for underestimating how their behavior affected their sibling's self-esteem and mental health.\n\nAlso, when the brother confronted them, the author got defensive instead of listening. The author was \"really fucking pissed off\" and felt like the brother was throwing away the relationship. That defensiveness could be seen as not taking responsibility, which is part of the problem. Even if the author didn't intend harm, responding with anger to the brother's valid feelings now isn't constructive.\n\nAnother angle is the brother's current popularity in university. The author mentions that the brother isn't shy or introverted now, but that doesn't mean the past teasing didn't affect him. People can outgrow their hobbies or develop confidence over time, but the emotional scars from being bullied by a sibling might still linger, especially if the sibling never apologized or acknowledged the impact.\n\nSo, the author's actions as a child were harmful, even if unintentional. The fact that the brother felt so ashamed that he cried suggests that the author was indeed a bully in a way that caused real emotional damage. The author's annoyance at not being forgiven might stem from not recognizing the seriousness of their past behavior. The brother's right to feel hurt is valid, and the author's current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings could be their way of avoiding accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions had a negative impact on their brother, and their defensiveness now might make them the asshole, even if their intentions were different back then. The key is that intent doesn't always matter as much as the effect, especially in relationships. The author should consider apologizing for the past behavior and understanding the brother's feelings rather than being angry about the ongoing issue.\n"
