In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author was teasing their brother about anime and hobbies when they were younger, and now the brother hasn't forgiven them even after 10 years. The author is upset because they think the teasing wasn't that bad and they didn't mean it maliciously. They got angry when the brother brought it up again, especially after giving a thoughtful gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author claims they never meant harm, but they were a bully. Bullying, even if not malicious, can have lasting effects. The brother was teased about something he was passionate about, which made him feel ashamed and cry. That's significant emotional impact. The author's actions, even if not intended, caused long-term harm. \n\nThen, when the brother finally confronted him, the author got angry instead of empathizing. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's reaction of being \"really fucking pissed off\" shows a lack of understanding. The author is also dismissing the brother's experiences by saying it's ridiculous that he felt embarrassed, not realizing that the brother's perception is real and hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are the lasting emotional impact on the brother, the author's failure to acknowledge the damage, and their anger at being confronted. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the effects are real. The brother's right to feel hurt and not forgive after 10 years is valid. The author's annoyance at not being forgiven and their anger instead of empathy might indicate they are in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be Yes (A), the author is in the wrong because their teasing caused lasting harm, and their reaction to the confrontation lacks empathy and understanding.\n"
