In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who feels the other brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if they didn't mean it maliciously. They teased their brother about his anime interests. The brother is now upset and has been cold towards him for years. The author is annoyed because their brother hasn't forgiven him after so long and even got a gift for his birthday, which the brother appreciated but still took the opportunity to confront him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions as a child\u2014teasing about something the brother was passionate about\u2014could have made the brother feel embarrassed or ashamed. Even if it wasn't intentional, the impact was negative. The brother's reaction, holding a grudge for 10 years, might seem excessive, but it's also valid that he felt hurt and that the teasing affected him deeply. \n\nThe key points here are intention vs. impact. The author might not have meant harm, but their actions did cause significant emotional pain. Being a bully, even in a light-hearted way, can have long-lasting effects. The brother's feelings are legitimate, and the author's frustration at the ongoing tension might not outweigh the brother's right to feel hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's annoyance at the brother not moving on could be seen as dismissing the brother's feelings. The author might not fully grasp how the teasing affected him. However, the brother's approach\u2014confronting him after being thankful for the gift\u2014might not be the healthiest way to address the issue, but it doesn't negate the author's role in the conflict.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's initial actions were wrong, even if unintended. They should take responsibility and work on mending the relationship. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
