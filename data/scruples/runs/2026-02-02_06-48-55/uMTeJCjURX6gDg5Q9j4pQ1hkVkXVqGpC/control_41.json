In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer A or B based on the situation described. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author, let's call him Person A, is a 26-year-old who is upset because his 23-year-old brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him as a kid. The teasing was about anime and other hobbies. Person A says he never meant it maliciously and didn't make him sleep upset. But the brother, Person B, says that he was made to feel like a weirdo and would cry himself to sleep because of the teasing. Now, even after 10 years, the brother is still hurt and lashed out after receiving a gift from Person A.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if Person A was in the wrong for the original teasing. Bullying is a serious issue, even if it's not physical. Teasing can be a form of emotional bullying, especially if it targets someone's interests and makes them feel embarrassed. Person A admitted to teasing, even if he thought it was harmless. The key here is the impact on the brother. Person B felt embarrassed and was emotionally affected, which is a clear sign that the teasing was harmful, even if Person A didn't intend it.\n\nNow, the second part is about the current situation. Person A is annoyed that his brother hasn't let go of the past and is angry about the brother's outburst. The question is whether Person A is in the wrong for being angry at his brother for not moving on. Well, the brother is still hurt, so maybe the expectation that someone should move on in 10 years isn't realistic. People process and heal from emotional wounds at different rates. The fact that the brother felt the need to confront Person A after so long indicates that the hurt was significant. \n\nIn terms of the current conflict, Person A is upset that the brother is still holding a grudge, but if the original teasing was indeed harmful, then Person A might have some responsibility. The brother's reaction isn't unreasonable if the teasing had a lasting negative impact. So, Person A's anger at the brother for not moving on might be misplaced, especially if he contributed to the problem in the first place.\n\nAlso, the brother's statement about feeling like a weirdo and crying suggests that the teasing was more than just harmless fun. Even if the author didn't mean it maliciously, the effect was there. So, maybe the original action was in the wrong, making the answer A. But then, the second part is about being angry now. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. If the brother is justified in still being hurt, then Person A's anger might be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering both parts: the original teasing caused lasting harm, and the brother is justified in his feelings. The author's annoyance at the brother for not letting go might be invalid because the brother's feelings are real and justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong both for the original behavior and for being angry at the brother's current reaction. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
