In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main points are:\n\nThe author, as a child and young teen, teased their brother about his interests, mainly anime. They admit to being a bully, but claim it wasn't malicious and they never let him sleep upset. Now, the brother is still holding a grudge, and after 10 years, he confronted the author about how it made him cry and feel embarrassed. The author is upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them and is angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was in the wrong initially. Bullying, even if not malicious, can still be harmful. Teasing someone about their hobbies can lead to embarrassment and low self-esteem, especially if it's repeated over time. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep, which indicates emotional harm. Even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, the impact matters. So the initial actions were wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nNow, the current situation: the author is angry that their brother hasn't let go of this after a decade. The brother finally opened up about how deeply it affected him. The author's reaction is frustration, but maybe they should take responsibility instead of getting angry at the brother for still being hurt. Holding a grudge is valid if the hurt was real. The author's anger at their brother's unresolved feelings might be misplaced. The brother's feelings are legitimate, and the author's initial bullying is the root issue. So the author is in the wrong for both the past actions and the current reaction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
