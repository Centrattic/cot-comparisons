In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author, let's call him Brother A, is 26, and his brother, Brother B, is 23. As kids, Brother A used to tease Brother B about his anime hobby. He admits to being a bully but claims it wasn't malicious and that he never let Brother B go to sleep upset. They grew apart when they went to university, and Brother B has been cold towards him. For Brother B's birthday, Brother A gave him a gift related to anime, which Brother B appreciated but then later expressed deep hurt, saying he felt embarrassed and cried because of Brother A's teasing. Now, Brother A is angry that his brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years and feels the brother is throwing away their relationship over past teasing.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the nature of the bullying. Brother A says it was teasing but not malicious. However, Brother B's response indicates that the teasing had a lasting negative impact, causing him emotional distress and affecting his self-image. Even if the teasing was light-hearted, if it made someone feel like a \"weirdo\" and caused them to cry, that's significant. The fact that Brother B is now at university and is popular suggests that maybe his confidence improved, but the past trauma still lingers.\n\nBrother A is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on. He's angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him after a decade. But the question is whether Brother A is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, and I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Brother A acknowledges his behavior as bullying, even if unintentional. The effects on Brother B were real and harmful. Even if Brother A didn't mean harm, the consequences were there. Also, giving a gift related to the same hobby that was a source of teasing might not have been the best approach, as it could have triggered Brother B's negative feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, Brother A didn't continue the behavior and even tried to reconcile by giving a gift. He might not have realized the extent of the hurt. However, the key issue is whether the past actions were wrong and if the current anger is misplaced.\n\nIn terms of accountability, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, if it caused lasting harm, there's a responsibility to acknowledge that and make amends. Brother A's anger at Brother B for not letting it go might be dismissive of Brother B's valid feelings. Holding a grudge is tough, but the original behavior had real consequences. The fact that Brother B is still upset after 10 years shows the depth of the hurt.\n\nSo, Brother A's actions as a child/teen were harmful, even if unintended. His current anger at the brother not forgiving him seems to be minimizing the brother's experience. The correct approach would be to take responsibility, seek reconciliation, and not be angry that the brother is still hurt. Therefore, Brother A might be in the wrong for both the initial bullying and his current reaction.\n"
