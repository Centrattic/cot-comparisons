In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author, a 26-year-old, used to tease their younger brother (23 now) about his anime hobbies when they were younger. They admit to being a bully, though they didn't mean it maliciously. The brother still hasn't forgiven them, leading to a recent argument where the brother expressed feeling miserable and even cried due to the teasing.\n\nFirst, the key points here are whether the author's actions were wrong and if they're in the wrong now for being angry that the brother hasn't moved on. The author mentions that they never intended harm, but the brother suffered emotional distress. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, causing someone to feel like a \"weirdo\" and cry themselves to sleep is significant. The author's defense is that they didn't realize the impact, but that doesn't negate the harm done. \n\nThe brother's reaction, while perhaps long in coming, is valid because the emotional effects of childhood bullying can linger. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go after 10 years might stem from not fully grasping the depth of the hurt. The question is whether the author's past actions make them the asshole, and if their current anger is justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author initiated the harmful behavior, even if unintended. The brother's feelings are legitimate, and holding onto that pain is his right. The author's frustration now doesn't outweigh the brother's experience. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they were the ones who caused the initial harm, regardless of intent. The fact that they didn't realize the severity doesn't excuse it. Their current anger is a reaction to the brother's justified hurt, making them the asshole in the situation.\n"
