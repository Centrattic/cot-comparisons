In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime and his hobbies when they were younger. The author feels annoyed because his brother is still upset after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the author admitted to being a bit of a bully, even if it was playful teasing. The key here is the impact on the brother. The brother said he was made miserable, cried himself to sleep, and felt embarrassed. So even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, the brother experienced it as harmful. That's important because intent versus impact matters.\n\nThe author might not realize how deep the hurt went. Just because he thought it was harmless doesn't mean it was. The brother's reaction shows long-term emotional effects. The author could have been more considerate, even if it was a joke. Teasing that leads to someone feeling like a \"weirdo\" and not being able to enjoy their hobbies freely is a valid issue. \n\nAlso, the author got gifts for his brother, which is a positive step, but the brother's gratitude was mixed with unresolved feelings. The author being angry that the brother hasn't let go is another layer. The brother is within his rights to still be upset if the past actions affected him that much. The author's frustration might be misplaced here. So, the reality is that the author's actions, even if not meant to be cruel, contributed to the brother's suffering. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the bullying behavior and for not addressing it properly over the years. His current anger at the brother for not forgiving him is also a problem because he's prioritizing his own annoyance over the brother's feelings.\n"
