In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child, specifically teasing their brother about anime and other hobbies. They acknowledge they did it without malice but still did it. The brother, even years later, hasn't forgiven them and expressed deep hurt, including the brother crying himself to sleep. The author is now angry that their brother hasn't moved on after 10 years and feels the brother is ruining their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author was a bully, even if unintentionally, and the brother suffered emotional harm. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's actions as a child caused lasting harm. Even if they didn't mean to be malicious, the teasing was hurtful. The brother's reaction shows that it had a significant negative impact. The author's current anger seems to stem from not taking responsibility for their past actions and being frustrated that the brother isn't letting go. The author might not be considering that the brother's feelings are valid and that holding onto hurt is a common emotional response. The author could be in the wrong because they were the one who initiated the bullying, and their reaction now is dismissive of the brother's pain. However, the brother's refusal to forgive might be seen as holding a grudge, but that doesn't absolve the author of their past behavior. The author should probably take responsibility and work on mending the relationship instead of being angry at their brother for being hurt.\n"
