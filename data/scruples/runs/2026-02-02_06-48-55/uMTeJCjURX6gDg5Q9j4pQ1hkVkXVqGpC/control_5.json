In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling who was teased about their interests (anime) as a child, leading to a long-standing resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of the author. They admit to being a bit of a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious. The key points here are that the bullying happened over a long period, even if not with ill intent. Teasing about someone's hobbies, especially when they're a child, can have lasting emotional impacts. The brother felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep, which indicates serious emotional harm.\n\nThe author mentions that they didn't realize the extent of the hurt they caused. However, even if the teasing wasn't intended to be malicious, the fact that it caused significant emotional distress over the years is important. The brother's reaction at 23, after 10 years, shows that the effects of those actions have lingered. The author's frustration at the brother not moving on might be valid, but it doesn't negate the harm done.\n\nThe question also asks if the author is in the wrong for being angry now. Their anger at the brother not forgiving them after so long could be seen as a reaction to feeling blamed, but considering the brother's experience, the author's past actions are a key factor here. The author's initial teasing, even if not malicious, contributed to a hostile environment for their sibling.\n\nIn terms of accountability, even if the teasing wasn't overtly cruel, persistent teasing can still be harmful. The author's failure to recognize the impact of their actions until the brother's outburst suggests a lack of awareness. While they tried to make amends with a gift, it's unclear if there was genuine reconciliation efforts beyond that. The brother's feelings of embarrassment and isolation are valid, and the author's actions, whether intentional or not, played a role in that.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions as a child had a negative impact on their brother, and even if unintentional, they contributed to long-term emotional damage. The author's current anger might be valid in feeling hurt by the lack of forgiveness, but the root issue is their past behavior. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong for their past actions, making them the Asshole in this scenario.\n"
