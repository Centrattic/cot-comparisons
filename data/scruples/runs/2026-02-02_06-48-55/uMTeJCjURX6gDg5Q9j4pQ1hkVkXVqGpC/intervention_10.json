In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling for liking anime. The author admits to bullying, even if not maliciously, and now the brother hasn't forgiven him after years. The author is annoyed that the brother still hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, the key elements here are bullying, emotional impact, and the passage of time. The author claims they never meant it maliciously and fixed things before bed, but the brother suffered emotional distress, crying himself to sleep. Emotional harm can last a long time, even if the perpetrator didn't intend it. The brother's outburst after 10 years shows that the effects were significant and long-lasting.\n\nThe author is now angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him. They argue the teasing wasn't that bad and that the brother is throwing away their relationship. However, the brother's perspective is that he felt embarrassed and isolated, which affected his self-esteem. Even if the hobbies are now mainstream, the brother's childhood experience was negative. The author's actions contributed to that, so they have a responsibility to acknowledge the harm.\n\nThe author's current annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings seems to minimize the brother's valid emotions. The fact that the brother felt the need to confront the author after such a long time shows that the issue was deeply impactful. The author's anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness might stem from a place of not taking full responsibility for their past actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author did something hurtful that had lasting effects. Even if unintended, the emotional damage existed. The brother's right to feel upset is valid. So, the author is partly in the wrong for the initial bullying and for their current reaction. They should take responsibility and work on mending the relationship, rather than being angry that the hurt hasn't healed yet. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
