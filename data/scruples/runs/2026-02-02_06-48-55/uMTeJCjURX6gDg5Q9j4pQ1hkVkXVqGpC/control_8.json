In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother who used to tease his younger brother about anime and other hobbies when they were younger. Now, the younger brother hasn't forgiven him, and the author is upset that it's been 10 years but the younger brother is still holding a grudge. The author is angry about this and is asking if he's the asshole for what he did or for being angry now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The older brother admits to teasing, which the younger brother took as bullying. Even though the older brother didn't mean it maliciously, the impact on the younger brother was significant. The younger brother felt embarrassed and even cried himself to sleep. That's pretty serious emotional harm. The older brother might have thought the teasing was just fun, but it clearly affected the younger brother deeply.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The older brother didn't intend to harm, but the younger brother was harmed. The author is now upset that the younger brother hasn't moved on. But the younger brother's feelings are valid because he's been dealing with that emotional pain for a long time. The fact that the older brother didn't realize the extent of the damage might mean he was unaware, but that doesn't erase the harm done. \n\nAlso, the author is angry now at the younger brother for not letting go. That reaction could be seen as dismissive of the younger brother's feelings. The older brother is frustrated because he thinks the teasing wasn't that bad, but the younger brother's experience is real. The author might be in the wrong because he's not taking responsibility for the impact of his actions and is instead getting angry at the younger brother for being upset. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't mean to be malicious. But the problem isn't about intent alone; it's about how the actions affected the other person. Even if it was unintentional, the harm is still there. The author also hasn't made amends beyond giving a gift, which the younger brother appreciated but still felt conflicted about. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions as a child caused lasting hurt, and his current reaction is anger towards the younger brother for not moving on. That seems to be a failure to acknowledge the older brother's responsibility and the younger brother's valid feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for both the initial teasing and his current anger.\n"
