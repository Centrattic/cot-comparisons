In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing their brother about his anime hobbies growing up, and now the brother hasn't forgiven them even after years. The author feels annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously, by teasing their brother about his interests. The brother felt this affected him deeply, leading to emotional distress and a strained relationship. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't let go of past hurt after a decade.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the impact of the author's actions. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to harm, the brother clearly suffered. The author's defense is that they didn't mean it maliciously and that the brother's current coldness is just how he is. However, the brother's emotional response indicates that the teasing had lasting negative effects. \n\nThe author's current frustration seems to be about the brother not letting go of the past. The question here is whether the author's actions, though perhaps not malicious, were still wrong in the context of a sibling relationship. Bullying, even in a family setting, can have long-term consequences. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's annoyance at his brother's unresolved anger might stem from not fully understanding the depth of the hurt caused.\n\nAnother angle is the author's response to the brother's outburst. The brother expressed his feelings, and the author became angry, which suggests a lack of empathy or willingness to acknowledge the harm done. The author might be in the wrong for not taking responsibility for their past actions and for being upset that the brother still feels the need to address it after so long. \n\nThe brother's right to feel hurt and not have forgiven the author is valid. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were still harmful. The fact that the brother is now in a better place (popular in university) doesn't negate his past suffering. The author's current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings seems misplaced, especially given that the brother came forward with his feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions contributed to their brother's emotional pain, and their current frustration seems to overlook the brother's valid feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for both their past behavior and their present reaction.\n"
