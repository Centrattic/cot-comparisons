In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased as a child for liking anime and games, and now the older brother is upset that the younger one hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child, even if it wasn't malicious. Teasing someone about their interests can really hurt, especially if it's a sensitive area for them. The younger brother's response indicates that it had a lasting negative impact, leading to feelings of embarrassment and crying. Even if the older brother didn't mean harm, the effects were real and significant.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The older brother thought the teasing wasn't a big deal, but the younger brother clearly felt hurt. The fact that the younger brother is still upset after a decade shows it's a deep-seated issue. The older brother's anger at not being forgiven might stem from not understanding the extent of the harm, which could be part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the older brother's reaction to the apology (getting gifts) and then the younger brother's outburst suggests a lack of active listening or empathy. Calling the younger brother an asshole and being angry about not moving on might be where the author is truly in the wrong. The author should take responsibility for his past actions and work on mending the relationship instead of being defensive.\n\nSo, even if the initial teasing wasn't malicious, the author's failure to recognize the hurt caused and his defensive reaction now make him at least partially responsible. The younger brother's feelings are valid, and the author's anger at the lack of forgiveness shows a lack of understanding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
