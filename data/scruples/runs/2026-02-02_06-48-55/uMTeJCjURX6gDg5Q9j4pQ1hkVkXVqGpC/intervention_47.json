In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's brother not forgiving him for teasing him about anime and other interests when they were younger. The author feels justified because he didn't mean any harm, but the brother is still upset 10 years later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was actually in the wrong initially. Bullying or teasing, even if not intended to be malicious, can still have negative effects. The key points here are that the brother was being teased about his hobbies, which led to him feeling embarrassed and crying. The author might not have realized the extent of the emotional impact, but that doesn't mean the harm wasn't real. Intent vs. impact is a common issue here. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the actions did cause pain.\n\nNow, the second part is about the author being angry that his brother hasn't forgiven him after so long. The author is frustrated that the brother is holding onto past hurt and affecting their relationship. The brother, on the other hand, is still dealing with emotional wounds from childhood. It's possible that the brother needed more time or a genuine apology to move past it. The author might be dismissing the brother's feelings by thinking the teasing wasn't that bad, which could make the situation worse.\n\nSo, considering both sides: The initial teasing, even if not malicious, contributed to the brother's emotional distress. The author might not have recognized the severity, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. Additionally, the author's reaction to the brother's feelings being valid could be seen as dismissive now. When the brother expressed his pain, the author was defensive and angry, which is a problem. The author should have taken responsibility and tried to make amends instead of getting upset that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong both for his past actions and his current reaction. He needs to acknowledge the impact of his teasing and work on rebuilding trust, rather than being angry that the brother is still hurt.\n"
