In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being annoyed that their brother still hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime and other hobbies when they were younger. The brother finally confronted the author, revealing that he felt deeply affected, even crying himself to sleep, and the author is upset that this hasn't been resolved after years.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to being a bully, albeit not maliciously. They teased their brother about his interests, which the brother took seriously. The brother's emotional response now shows lasting effects, even though the author didn't realize the impact at the time. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on, thinking the teasing wasn't that bad.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to assess both sides. The author's actions as a child were bullying, even if not intentionally harmful. Bullying can have long-term effects, and the brother's feelings are valid. The author's current reaction dismisses the brother's feelings, focusing on their own frustration that the brother hasn't let go. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of the lasting harm caused. However, the author did attempt to make amends by giving a thoughtful gift, which shows some awareness.\n\nThe brother's behavior is also extreme, holding a grudge for a decade, but his emotional response is genuine. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might come from not fully recognizing the depth of the harm done. In such cases, even if the initial intent wasn't malicious, the impact matters. The author's current frustration might stem from not taking the brother's feelings seriously enough, which would place them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
