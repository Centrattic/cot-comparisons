In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author admits to being a bully as a child, teasing their brother about anime and hobbies, even if it wasn't meant to be malicious. Now, their brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years, leading to the author feeling angry that the brother hasn't let it go.\n\nFirst, the author's actions as a child were bullying. Even if it wasn't malicious, the impact on their brother was significant. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed, which shows real emotional harm. The author might not have realized the severity back then, but that doesn't negate the effect it had. \n\nThe author is now upset that the brother is still holding a grudge. However, it's important to consider that healing from emotional wounds takes time. The brother's reaction, while intense, is a reflection of the lasting impact of the bullying. The author's anger at the brother for not moving on might stem from not fully acknowledging the depth of the hurt caused. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to cause harm, but the impact was real. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's frustration at the unresolved issue doesn't make them right. The author might need to take responsibility for their past actions, even if unintentional, and work on rebuilding the relationship rather than getting angry about the brother's unresolved feelings. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were the bully, even if unintentionally, and their current anger is misplaced given the brother's justified hurt.\n"
