In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used to tease his brother a lot about his interests, mainly anime, when they were younger. The brother is still holding a grudge even after 10 years. The author is annoyed that his brother hasn't forgiven him and is upset about losing their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author claims the teasing wasn't malicious and that he never let the brother go to sleep upset. But the brother is saying that he cried himself to sleep because he felt like a weirdo and that the author made his teenage years miserable. The author is now angry that the brother isn't over it after a decade.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author might not have intended to hurt his brother, but the effect was harmful. Even if the teasing wasn't physical bullying, the emotional impact is real. The brother's feelings of embarrassment and loneliness leading to tears are significant. Also, the author continued to tease him about the same interests over years, which could be seen as ongoing harm, even if not malicious in intent.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is now upset because he's angry about the brother not letting it go. He's frustrated after the brother's outburst. But holding a grudge for 10 years is a long time. However, deep emotional wounds can take much longer to heal, especially if someone felt isolated or judged by a sibling. The brother might have struggled with self-esteem because of the teasing, which affects him even into adulthood.\n\nThe author's actions as a child were bullying, even if it was in the form of teasing. Bullying isn't always about physical harm; it's about repeated behavior that causes someone to feel targeted. The fact that the brother is now in university and more confident doesn't negate past pain. The author's current anger at the brother for not moving on might be an example of not taking responsibility for his past actions, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he didn't realize the severity of his actions at the time and now expects the brother to forgive him quickly. The brother's reaction is valid if he felt genuinely hurt and unsupported. The author's frustration comes from not seeing the impact of his actions, which could mean he's still not fully understanding how he wronged his brother. So, even if the author didn't mean harm, the effect was harmful, making him at least partially responsible.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his actions, though perhaps not malicious, caused significant emotional harm, and his current frustration shows a lack of empathy towards his brother's ongoing feelings.\n"
