In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling for liking anime and other hobbies. The older brother is now 26 and feels annoyed that his younger brother, now 23, hasn't forgiven him for the teasing from their childhood. The younger brother confronted him on his birthday, expressing that the teasing made his teenage years miserable and he cried because of the embarrassment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The author admits to teasing his brother about his interests, even though he claims it wasn't malicious. The key point here is whether the teasing, even if not intended to harm, actually caused significant harm. The younger brother explains that he felt embarrassed to his own hobbies, which affected him deeply enough to cry. Even if the author didn't mean it, the impact is real.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. The author is now angry that the younger brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. But the younger brother's feelings are valid. The author's actions, even if not malicious, led to emotional distress. The fact that the author didn't realize the extent of the hurt shows a lack of awareness, which could be part of the problem. The author's current anger at the younger brother for not letting go might be a reaction to feeling blamed, but the root issue is his past actions.\n\nBrother relationships are complex. The author might not see the teasing as severe, but the impact on the younger brother's self-esteem and social standing is significant. Even if the hobbies are now mainstream, at the time they might have been a source of vulnerability. The author's failure to apologize or take responsibility could contribute to the ongoing tension. The younger brother's right to feel hurt and seek forgiveness is valid. The author's annoyance at the unresolved issue suggests he may not fully grasp the depth of the harm caused. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for both his past actions and his current reaction.\n"
