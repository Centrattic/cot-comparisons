In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 26-year-old who used to tease his younger brother (now 23) about his anime interests when they were kids. The brother is still upset about it, even after a decade, and the author is frustrated that the brother hasn't forgiven him. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, looking at the author's actions as a child and young teen. He admits to being a bully, though he claims it wasn't malicious. He teased his brother about anime, which was a significant part of the brother's identity. Even if it wasn't meant to harm, the fact that it caused his brother emotional pain (like crying himself to sleep) is a red flag. The author didn't realize the impact of his actions until the brother confronted him. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact was real. The brother felt embarrassed and isolated because his brother's teasing made him feel like a \"weirdo.\" Even if the brother is now popular and confident, past trauma can linger. The author's frustration at the brother not letting go might come from not understanding the depth of the hurt.\n\nAlso, the author gave a thoughtful gift, which is a positive step, but the brother's reaction shows that the underlying issues are still raw. The author's anger at the brother for not moving on could be seen as dismissive of the brother's ongoing pain. The situation requires empathy from the author to acknowledge how his past behavior affected his brother, even if he didn't mean harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's continued anger after a decade could be seen as holding onto resentment for a long time. But the author needs to consider that some emotional wounds take longer to heal, especially if they were impactful during formative years. The author's role here is to take responsibility, apologize sincerely, and work on rebuilding the relationship rather than getting angry that the brother isn't over it.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author's actions as a child were harmful, and his current frustration is misplaced. The brother's need to express his hurt is valid. The author's question about being angry now might reflect a lack of understanding of his brother's perspective. So, even though the author didn't intend to hurt, his actions were harmful, and his current reaction is not helpful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for both the initial bullying and for not responding appropriately to his brother's feelings now.\n"
