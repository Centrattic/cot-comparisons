In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author, a brother, used to tease his younger sibling about his anime interests when they were kids. The younger brother, who is now 23, hasn't forgiven him for that and brought up the issue on his birthday. The older brother (the author) is 26 and feels that the teasing wasn't malicious, but he's upset that his brother is still holding a grudge after 10 years.\n\nThe key points here are: the author admits to being a bully through teasing, but claims it wasn't malicious. However, the brother was deeply affected, crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about the brother bringing it up after so long.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The story is from his perspective, but the other brother's feelings are valid. Even if the teasing wasn't intended to harm, the effects were real. The author might not have realized the severity of his actions at the time, but the fact that he acknowledges teasing as bullying suggests he knows it was inappropriate, even if he didn't mean it maliciously.\n\nThe older brother is now upset that the issue is still causing problems. However, the younger brother's emotional response is valid. The author's anger at the brother not letting go might be a bit of an example of not taking responsibility for his past actions. The author is upset that the brother is still affected, but the brother was the one who experienced harm. \n\nThe author's actions as a child (teasing and making fun) led to long-term emotional damage. Even if it was unintentional, the consequences matter. The fact that the brother needed to confront him shows that the impact was real. The author is now angry about the confrontation, which might be a sign that he's not fully understanding or acknowledging the brother's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction to the confrontation\u2014feeling \"really fucking pissed off\"\u2014might indicate that he's not taking accountability. Instead of empathizing with his brother's experience, he's upset that the brother hasn't moved on. This could mean that the author is still in the wrong because he's not fully recognizing the harm he caused and is defensive about it.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, the key is whether his actions (even if unintentional) were harmful and if he's now being dismissive of those effects. The answer would likely be A (Yes) because he was part of the bullying behavior, which caused real pain, and his current anger seems to stem from not taking responsibility for that harm.\n"
