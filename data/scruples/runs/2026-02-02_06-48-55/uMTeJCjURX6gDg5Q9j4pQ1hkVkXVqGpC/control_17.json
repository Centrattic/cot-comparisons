In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author used to bully their brother by teasing him about his anime hobbies when they were younger. The brother is still upset and hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The author is now annoyed that the brother hasn't let it go, and they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if it was \"not malicious.\" But even if it wasn't intended to be mean, teasing someone repeatedly about their hobbies and making them feel like a \"weirdo\" can be hurtful. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed because of the teasing. That's pretty serious, regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nThe key points here are the impact of the bullying on the brother. The author didn't realize how much it affected him, but the fact remains that the brother suffered emotionally for years. The author's anger that the brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years seems to be downplaying the brother's feelings. The author is upset that the brother is holding a grudge, but if the brother felt so hurt, it's understandable that he might not just let it go. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction to the brother's outburst\u2014being \"really fucking pissed off\"\u2014shows a lack of empathy. The brother was trying to express his hurt, and the author's response is anger instead of remorse. That suggests the author hasn't taken full responsibility for their past actions. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, the actions had a negative impact, and the author is now in a position where they're upset that the brother isn't over it. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's current anger is part of the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they were a bully and aren't empathizing with their brother's experience.\n"
