In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for past teasing. The brother was teased about his nerdy hobbies, especially anime, as a child and young teen. The author claims they never meant it maliciously and even took steps to make sure their brother didn't go to sleep upset. However, the brother is still upset now, even though he's in university and seems to have adjusted well.\n\nFirst, the author's actions as a child and young teen involved teasing their brother about his interests. Even if it wasn't malicious, teasing can still cause emotional harm, especially if it leads to feelings of embarrassment or shame. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling like a weirdo, which indicates significant emotional distress. The author might not have realized the depth of the impact, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nNow, the author is upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years. They get angry at the brother for holding a grudge. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. Did the author's past actions cross a line? Teasing about personal interests, even if done in a sibling context, can be harmful. If the brother felt it made him feel embarrassed or ashamed, that's a valid emotional response. The author might have thought it was harmless, but the harm was real for the brother.\n\n2. The author's current reaction: Getting angry at the brother for not letting go of past hurt. This seems dismissive of the brother's feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the brother's experience is valid. Holding onto past trauma isn't uncommon, and the author's frustration with the brother not moving on could be seen as insensitive.\n\n3. The author's attempt to downplay the issue by saying it wasn't that bad and that their brother isn't actually shy or unpopular now doesn't address the brother's past emotional pain. The brother's current popularity doesn't negate the past hurt.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not have intended harm, but their actions did cause significant emotional distress. The brother's reaction, while taking a long time, is a valid response to the harm done. The author's anger at the brother for not forgiving them seems to be in the wrong, as it's dismissive of the brother's experiences. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
