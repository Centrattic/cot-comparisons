In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child, specifically teasing their brother about anime. They say they didn't mean it maliciously and didn't let the brother go to sleep upset. But the brother still hasn't forgiven them 10 years later and had an emotional outburst on his birthday.\n\nThe key points here are the past behavior and the current reaction. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for either their past actions or their current anger.\n\nFrom the brother's perspective, being teased by a sibling for years led to emotional distress, including crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, it's possible the author didn't realize the impact it had. The brother coming out with this shows that the effects were significant and long-lasting.\n\nThe author's current reaction is frustration that the brother hasn't let it go. However, the brother's feelings are valid. The author might not be in the wrong for being annoyed, but the original bullying is a problem. The author's actions as a child caused harm, and while they might not have intended to be malicious, the consequences are real for the brother. So, the author is partially in the wrong for past actions, but maybe not for being upset now. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall.\n\nThe dilemma is whether the author is the asshole for the past bullying or for being angry about the brother's unresolved feelings. The original behavior was hurtful, even if it wasn't malicious. The author's current frustration might be justified in wanting to move on, but they should also consider the brother's valid emotions. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because the initial bullying caused lasting harm, and they might not have fully acknowledged the impact on their brother. So answer A (Yes) might be the right choice.\n"
