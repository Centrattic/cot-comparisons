In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased about his interests as a child and now, even as adults, the sibling hasn't forgiven him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about anime and other hobbies. The brother, in turn, is still upset, saying it made him miserable and led him to cry. Now, after a decade, the brother confronts the author, leading to the author feeling angry that their brother hasn't moved on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. Let's analyze. Bullying, even if not intended to be malicious, can have lasting effects. The brother's emotional response suggests that the teasing had a significant negative impact on his self-esteem and happiness during his teenage years. The author's defense is that they never meant harm and that they've grown to appreciate anime now. However, the brother's feelings are valid, and holding onto past hurt is a personal reaction.\n\nThe author's own frustration at their brother not letting go might indicate a lack of understanding of the emotional toll their actions had. Even if the jokes seemed harmless to the author, they were harmful to their brother. The fact that the brother is still affected after 10 years shows the depth of the impact. So, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions did cause lasting pain, making them at least partly responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's reaction could be seen as holding a grudge, but that doesn't make the author right. The key here is the initial bullying behavior. The author's anger at their brother for still being upset might be a way of deflecting their own guilt. The author needs to take responsibility for their past actions, even if they weren't malicious. So, considering all this, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
