In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sibling who was bullied a bit by their older brother when they were younger. The older brother now feels that the younger one is still holding a grudge from over a decade ago and is upset that they haven't moved on. \n\nFirst, the author describes his past behavior as teasing his brother about anime and other interests. He claims it wasn't malicious, but the brother felt it deeply and it affected him emotionally. The key points here are the intent versus the impact. The author didn't mean to hurt, but the brother's experience was negative.\n\nNow, when the author gave a gift related to anime, the brother had a strong emotional reaction. He said he used to cry and felt embarrassed. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for either his past behavior or for being annoyed now.\n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, we need to consider both perspectives. The author may not have intended harm, but his actions did cause lasting hurt. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, the fact that it made his brother feel ashamed and affected his self-esteem is significant. The brother's emotional response is valid because the impact of bullying, even if not intended, can last a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on. But siblings have a responsibility to each other, and even if the older brother didn't mean to harm, he has a duty to acknowledge the pain he caused and try to repair the relationship. The author's annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings might be less about the actual issue and more about his own discomfort with being held accountable for past actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he caused emotional harm through his actions, even unintentionally, and the brother is still affected, then the responsibility is on the author to address that. His current anger at the brother for not letting go might be a way of avoiding taking full responsibility for his past behavior. The brother's need for forgiveness and for the relationship to be mended is important here. The author's frustration might be misplaced because the brother's feelings are legitimate, even if the author didn't intend harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his past actions caused lasting harm, and his current reaction is dismissive of his brother's legitimate feelings.\n"
