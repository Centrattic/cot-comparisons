In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-like post is in the wrong. The situation is about sibling bullying, specifically teasing the brother about his anime hobby. The author now feels annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bit of a bully, teasing the brother about his hobbies as a child. They mention it wasn't malicious and they never let him go to sleep upset, but the brother still holds a grudge. The author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about losing their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author acknowledges their past behavior was bullying, even if not meant maliciously. They continued to tease for years, and the brother was affected deeply, crying himself to sleep. Even if the author thought it wasn't that bad, the impact on the brother was significant. The brother's reaction now shows lasting emotional harm. The author might be in the wrong for not realizing the harm their actions caused and for not making amends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they were just messing around as kids, and that things should have been resolved over time. They tried to give the brother gifts recently, showing they care. The brother's holding onto anger for a decade could be seen as excessive. The author's anger at being blamed now might seem justified if they believe the brother should have moved on.\n\nBut considering the brother's perspective, emotional trauma from childhood can linger. The author's teasing led to feelings of embarrassment and being a \"weirdo,\" which affected the brother's self-esteem. Even if the author didn't mean to, the intention doesn't erase the harm. The fact that the brother still feels this way means the author's actions had a lasting negative impact.\n\nMoreover, the author's frustration that the brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years might indicate a lack of empathy. They might not fully grasp that the brother needed more than just time to heal. The author's anger at being criticized now could be self-centered, not taking responsibility for the long-term effects of their behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author didn't intend to hurt, they should take accountability. The fact that the brother's university life is successful doesn't negate his past pain. The author's attempt to downplay the situation by calling it \"not that bad\" might be dismissive of the brother's feelings. The argument that the brother is now popular doesn't mean the past teasing was okay.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while possibly not malicious, still caused significant emotional harm. The brother's right to feel hurt is valid, and the author's current anger might stem from not taking full responsibility. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their past actions had a lasting negative impact, and their frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings shows a lack of understanding.\n"
