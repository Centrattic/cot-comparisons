In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author bullies their younger brother by teasing him about his anime interests as a child and young teen. The brother is still upset 10 years later and had a breakdown after receiving a gift.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if they didn't mean it maliciously. They teased their brother about his hobbies, which the brother now says made his teenage years miserable and caused him to cry. The author is frustrated that the brother hasn't forgiven them after so long and is angry about the rebuke during their birthday.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The author engaged in bullying behavior, even if not with malicious intent. 2) The brother is still affected by it, leading to long-term emotional harm. 3) The author is upset that the brother hasn't let go of the past.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. Bullying, even if it seems harmless to the perpetrator, can have lasting effects on the victim. The author might not have realized the severity of their actions at the time, but the fact that their brother felt isolated and cried over it shows real harm. The author's defense is that they reconciled each day and didn't intend to hurt him, but the brother's experience contradicts that. The author's anger at the brother's lingering resentment is also a factor. It's possible that the author failed to recognize the emotional impact of their teasing, which might make them the asshole for not understanding or addressing their brother's feelings. Alternatively, if the brother is holding onto the past without seeking reconciliation, maybe he's the one being unreasonable. However, the author's actions did contribute to the brother's pain, so their responsibility might still lie with them. \n\nThe brother's current popularity in university doesn't negate his past experiences. People can change, but the damage from childhood can linger. The author not acknowledging the harm their behavior caused and instead being angry at the brother's reaction might be where they're in the wrong. The gifts and attempts to connect now might be seen as good, but without addressing the past, it's not enough. So, considering all that, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
