In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased about his interest in anime and video games by the other brother, who now feels the older brother is being an asshole for not being forgiven after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The older brother (the author) used to tease his younger sibling about their hobbies, which he now admits was bullying, even if he didn't mean it maliciously. The younger brother still holds a grudge, leading to a confrontation. The author is angry that the younger brother hasn't moved on.\n\nSo, the author is asking if he's at fault for the teasing or for being angry that the younger brother hasn't forgiven him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's analyze both sides. Bullying, even if not meant to be malicious, can have lasting effects. The younger brother felt ashamed and cried, which shows significant emotional impact. The author downplays the teasing as not being that bad, but the younger brother's reaction indicates it was harmful. The author's anger at the younger brother not moving on might reflect a lack of understanding of the emotional trauma caused. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did make an effort to connect with the younger brother by giving anime-related gifts recently, but the younger brother still felt hurt. The author's frustration about not being forgiven after 10 years is valid in that people should ideally move on, but if the harm was real and ongoing, that's different. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong to bully his brother, regardless of intent. Even if not malicious, bullying is still wrong. The author's initial actions were harmful, and not acknowledging the full extent of the damage might make him wrong. Also, being angry that someone isn't over a decade-old issue might not be justified if the initial actions were indeed harmful. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for the bullying and perhaps for not taking the younger brother's feelings seriously. The answer would be A.\n"
