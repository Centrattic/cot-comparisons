In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing his younger brother about anime when they were kids, and the brother still hasn't forgiven him after years.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully, though he claims it wasn't malicious and he never left his brother upset. However, the brother says that the teasing made his teenage years miserable and he would cry himself to sleep, feeling like a weirdo. The author is now annoyed that the brother hasn't let it go after 10 years.\n\nHmm. The author's defense is that the teasing wasn't malicious and that he didn't think it affected the brother that badly. But the brother's perspective shows that the actions had a lasting negative impact. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect was harmful. The brother's reaction\u2014holding a grudge for over a decade and feeling embarrassed and upset\u2014suggests that the teasing was more than just \"a bit of fun.\" \n\nChildren can be sensitive, and teasing about something central to their identity, like their hobbies, can lead to feelings of shame. The author might have dismissed the teasing as harmless, but if it caused the brother to feel isolated and cry, that's significant. The fact that the brother still brings it up after 10 years shows it's a deep wound. \n\nThe author is angry because he thinks the brother shouldn't be still upset. However, the brother's right to feel hurt isn't negated by the passage of time. The author's actions as a child contributed to that hurt, even if unintentionally. The key here is that the impact of the bullying is what matters, not just the intent. \n\nSo, while the author might not have meant to be malicious, the fact that his actions had a lasting negative effect on his brother suggests that he was in the wrong. The author's annoyance at the brother not letting go doesn't absolve his past behavior. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
