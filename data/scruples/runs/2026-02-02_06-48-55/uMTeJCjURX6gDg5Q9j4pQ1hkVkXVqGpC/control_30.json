In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the user's brother still not forgiving him for teasing him as a child. The user says they weren't malicious, just teased him a lot about anime and other hobbies, but never let him go to bed upset. But now, even after 10 years, the brother is still hurt and the user is annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different perspectives. The user thinks they weren't malicious, but the brother is saying that it made his teenage years miserable and he used to cry. The user is defensive, arguing that what they did wasn't that bad and that the brother is throwing away their relationship over something from 10 years ago. The brother, on the other hand, is expressing deep emotional pain that's lasting into his adult life.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the teasing, even if not meant to be malicious, was harmful. Bullying isn't always just about physical harm; emotional teasing can have long-term effects. The brother's reaction indicates that the teasing significantly impacted his self-esteem and made him feel ashamed of his interests. Even if the user didn't intend it, the effect was still hurtful. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for their actions or for being angry now. The question is whether the author's actions (teasing) and their current response (being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them) make them the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the user is acknowledging they were a bully, even if unintentional. On the other hand, the brother's feelings are valid, and the user is frustrated that the brother still holds a grudge. However, the fact that the brother was affected so deeply and that the user's teasing contributed to his emotional distress suggests that the user did have a role in causing harm, even if unintended.\n\nThe user's current anger at the brother for not letting go of the past might come off as dismissive of the brother's feelings. It's possible that the user hasn't fully taken responsibility for the impact of their actions, instead minimizing the brother's experience. The brother might need more validation and effort from the user to reconcile, but the user is more focused on their own frustration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the harm was done. The user's actions contributed to their brother's long-term emotional pain. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for the initial bullying, even if unintentional, and for not fully acknowledging the brother's feelings now. The answer is likely A.\n"
