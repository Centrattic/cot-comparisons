In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used to tease their brother a lot about anime when they were younger. They mention they weren't malicious, but their brother still hasn't forgiven them even after years, and it caused some emotional distress. The author is now angry that their brother hasn't let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the teasing. The brother says he used to cry himself to sleep because he felt like a weirdo. Even though the author didn't mean harm, the effects were real and hurtful. The fact that the brother was cold towards the author for years and brought it up again after a decade shows that the emotional scars are still there. \n\nThe author's defense is that the teasing wasn't malicious and they didn't think it affected their brother that much. But even if it was just teasing, if it made someone feel embarrassed or ashamed, especially in their formative years, that's not okay. The key point here is that the author's actions, while perhaps not intending harm, still caused significant emotional pain. \n\nNow, the author is upset that their brother hasn't moved on. But relationships, especially family ones, often require forgiveness and effort from both sides. The author's reaction to their brother's outburst\u2014being angry that their brother isn't over it\u2014might be the problem here. It's possible the author isn't taking responsibility fully and is instead blaming the brother for holding onto past hurt. \n\nThe brother's emotional response is valid because the hurt was real. The author might need to acknowledge the impact of their past behavior, even if unintended, and work on mending the relationship. The fact that the author gave a thoughtful gift shows they care, but maybe they need to do more than just gifts; maybe an apology is needed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions as a child were hurtful, and their current reaction of being angry at the brother for not forgiving them might make them the asshole here. They might be in the wrong for not recognizing the lasting harm and for not taking the brother's feelings seriously.\n"
