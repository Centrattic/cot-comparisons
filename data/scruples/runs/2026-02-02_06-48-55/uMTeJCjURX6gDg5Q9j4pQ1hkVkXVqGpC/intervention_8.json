In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author, a sibling, is upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime and other hobbies when they were younger. The brother eventually confronted them, saying it made him miserable and even cry, which the author didn't realize. Now the author is angry that the brother hasn't let go after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously. They teased their brother about his interests, which led to a rift. The brother's reaction indicates that the teasing had a lasting negative impact, causing emotional distress. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved past it, feeling the issue should be resolved after a decade.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author may not have meant to harm, but the effect on the brother was significant. The brother's feelings of embarrassment and loneliness are real, even if the author didn't intend them. The fact that the brother felt the need to hide his interests and experienced emotional pain is a strong point against the author. \n\nHowever, the author is also expressing frustration now, feeling that the brother is holding onto the past and damaging their relationship. The author's current anger might be a reaction to the sudden confrontation and the realization of the past harm. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the author's actions still caused harm. The brother's feelings aren't invalid just because the author didn't mean to hurt. The author's initial behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, and not taking responsibility for that immediately after the confrontation could exacerbate the situation. \n\nBut the brother has also taken a long time to address the issue, which might be part of the problem. However, the fact that he finally spoke up and shared his feelings doesn't make him wrong; it shows he was affected deeply. The author's anger at the brother not letting go might be a way of deflecting from their own role in the problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions did cause harm, even if unintentionally. The brother's reaction is a valid emotional response to that harm. The author's current anger seems to stem from feeling criticized and wanting the issue to be forgotten, which is not fair to the brother who suffered. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their past actions had a negative impact, and their current reaction dismisses the brother's feelings.\n"
