In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between brothers. The older brother used to tease the younger one about his anime hobbies when they were kids. The younger brother is still upset about it 10 years later and hasn't forgiven him. The author is now angry that the younger brother hasn't moved on and is holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, though he says it wasn't malicious. He teased his brother about something he was into, which made the brother feel ashamed. Even if it wasn't done with ill intent, teasing someone about their interests can be hurtful, especially if it's repeated over time. The younger brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling like a weirdo because of the older brother's comments. That's significant emotional impact.\n\nThe author downplays the teasing, saying it's not a bad thing to enjoy anime now, but that doesn't erase the past hurt. The key points here are the lasting effects on the younger brother and the author's lack of understanding. The author is angry that the brother hasn't let it go, but the brother's reaction is valid because emotional wounds can last a long time. The author might not see his actions as bullying, but if it caused lasting harm, then he is partly responsible. \n\nAlso, the author gave a gift related to anime, which the brother appreciated but was still upset. The brother's outburst after dinner shows the depth of his hurt. The author's frustration is about the brother's holding a grudge, but maybe he should have considered that the brother needed more than just a gift\u2014he might need an apology or acknowledgment of the hurt. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions as a child (even if not malicious) contributed to the brother's emotional distress. Now, the author is upset about the brother's reaction, but the brother's feelings are legitimate. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the severity of his past behavior and for being angry at the brother's justified hurt. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
