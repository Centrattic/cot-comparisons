In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author teasing their brother about anime when they were younger, and the brother still hasn't forgiven them, even years later.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author admits they were a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious and that they never let the brother go to bed upset. They teased him about his hobbies, specifically anime, even though they both played video games together. The brother became distant after going to university, and the author thought that's just his nature. The brother finally confronted the author after receiving a gift, revealing that he was miserable and even cried because of the teasing. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I read, the author acknowledges they were a bully. Even though they didn't mean it maliciously, the effect on the brother was significant. The brother felt embarrassed and cried, which suggests that the teasing had a lasting negative impact. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm caused, but the fact remains that their actions contributed to their brother's emotional pain.\n\nEven if the author didn't intend to hurt, the consequences are there. The brother's reaction indicates that the past behavior was hurtful and affected his self-esteem. The author's frustration that the brother hasn't let go might be because they don't see their actions as that harmful, but the brother's experience is valid. However, it's also important to consider that the author is now trying to make amends with gifts, but maybe that's not enough. The key issue is that the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, were still harmful, and they might need to take more responsibility and make a genuine effort to reconcile.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, their actions were hurtful. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for the teasing. But the second part is about being angry that the brother hasn't let it go. The author is upset that the brother is still holding a grudge. Is that their fault? Well, the brother has the right to feel hurt, so the author's anger might be misplaced. They need to take responsibility for their actions rather than being upset that the brother is still affected.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions caused harm, even if unintentional, and their reaction is not taking full responsibility.\n"
