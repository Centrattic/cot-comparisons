In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is a 26-year-old who, as a child and young teen, teased their younger brother about anime and other interests. He claims he didn't mean it maliciously and never let the brother go to bed upset. But now, the brother is still upset and unforgiving, leading the author to feel annoyed and question if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to bullying behavior, even if not malicious. Teasing about hobbies, specifically anime, which the brother was into. The brother felt it affected him deeply, leading to crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The author is frustrated that after 10 years, the brother hasn't moved on, and the author is angry about the ongoing tension.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The author acknowledges their past behavior but might downplay its impact. The brother's reaction suggests that the teasing had a significant emotional impact, even if the author didn't intend harm. The fact that the brother was crying and felt embarrassed for years indicates that the teasing wasn't just harmless fun. The author's current anger at the brother for not letting go might be a defense mechanism or a sign of not fully understanding the long-term effects of their actions.\n\nBut wait, the author did try to apologize and even gave a gift, which the brother appreciated but still expressed his hurt. The author might be in the wrong for the initial bullying, and their anger now could stem from not taking responsibility or not understanding the brother's perspective. The brother's right to feel hurt because of past actions is valid, even if the author didn't mean to be malicious. The author's frustration might be misplaced here\u2014maybe they should focus on understanding their brother's feelings rather than being angry about the lack of forgiveness.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions as a child were harmful, even if not malicious. The current issue is the author's reaction to the brother's unresolved feelings. The author might not be in the wrong for being annoyed, but the original bullying is definitely on them. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The main question is about the author's current stance\u2014being angry at the brother for not forgiving them. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were wrong and if their current anger is justified.\n\nIn the context of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" genre, the community often looks at intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the impact was significant. So the author might be the asshole for the bullying and for not recognizing the lasting harm. Their current anger could also be part of the issue if they are dismissing the brother's valid feelings. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the initial behavior was harmful, and their current reaction doesn't address that.\n"
