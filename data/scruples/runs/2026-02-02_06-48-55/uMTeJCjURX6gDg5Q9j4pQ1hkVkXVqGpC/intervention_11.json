In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves sibling bullying from childhood and ongoing resentment.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully towards his brother, teasing him about anime and other hobbies. He claims it wasn't malicious, but the brother felt it affected him deeply, leading to crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The brother hasn't forgiven him even after 10 years, causing a rift in their relationship.\n\nThe author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on and even got angry when the brother confronted him. He's questioning if his anger is justified or if he's the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's past behavior, the brother's emotional impact, and the current conflict over forgiveness. \n\nEven if the teasing wasn't meant to be harmful, the effect on the brother was significant. The author's actions as a child had real consequences, and holding onto resentment for a decade is understandable for the brother. However, the author's current frustration about the unresolved issue might be valid. But the initial bullying is a clear wrong-doing. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his actions were harmful regardless of intent. Since the brother was deeply affected, the author's behavior was wrong, even if unintended. Also, his reaction now\u2014being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him\u2014might show a lack of empathy towards the lasting impact of his actions.\n\nSo, likely answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his past actions caused harm, and his current anger overlooks the brother's justified feelings.\n"
