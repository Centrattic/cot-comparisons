In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who teased his sibling about anime and other interests when they were younger. Now, years later, the brother hasn't forgiven him, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits they were a bully as a child, teasing their brother about his hobbies, mainly anime. They say it wasn't malicious, but the brother still hasn't forgiven them. The brother opened up after the author gave him a gift related to anime, showing that he's still hurt. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics of bullying. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, if it caused emotional harm, that's still an issue. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author downplays the impact, thinking it wasn't that bad because they didn't intend harm. But the effects on the brother's self-esteem and emotional well-being matter.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction to the brother's feelings is problematic. Instead of acknowledging the hurt and taking responsibility, the author feels angry that the brother hasn't let it go. That's a key point. If someone is hurt by past actions, it's not the victim's fault for not forgiving. The onus is on the person who caused the harm to make amends.\n\nAnother angle: the author's justification that they never meant it maliciously. But intent isn't the only factor; impact is. Even if the intention wasn't to harm, the teasing had a lasting negative effect. The author should take responsibility for that impact, regardless of intent.\n\nMoreover, the author is upset about the brother's continued resentment. But the brother's feelings are valid. Holding onto past hurt isn't uncommon, especially if the apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing was missing. The author hasn't shown they've truly apologized or made efforts to reconcile beyond the gift. The brother's reaction is a response to years of unaddressed hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for their actions as a child and for their current reaction. The bullying had real consequences, and the author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings shows a lack of empathy. The right approach would have been to apologize sincerely and understand the brother's perspective, not to dismiss the hurt caused.\n"
