In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B, so I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child towards his brother, teasing him about his anime hobbies. He claims it wasn't malicious and he never let him go to sleep upset. But the brother is still holding a grudge 10 years later, even after getting a gift from him. The brother felt that his teen years were miserable, crying himself to sleep, and now the author is upset that the brother hasn't forgiven him.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions as a child and his current reaction. The author's actions as a child were teasing, which can be a form of bullying. Even if it wasn't malicious, the effect on the brother was significant\u2014leading to emotional distress, crying, and long-term resentment. The author might not have realized the impact, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nNow, the author is angry that the brother hasn't moved on. The brother's reaction is valid because he had a bad experience. The author's current anger seems to be about the brother not letting go, not acknowledging his past wrongs. The brother hasn't received an apology from the author, as far as the story goes. The author gave a gift, but the brother's emotional pain wasn't addressed properly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who caused the hurt (author) has a responsibility to acknowledge the harm, apologize sincerely, and make amends. If the author hasn't done that, then he's at least partially in the wrong. The fact that he's angry the brother is still upset suggests he's not taking full accountability. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother holding onto a decade-old grudge could be seen as extreme, but it's also his right to feel that way. The author's current anger at the brother not letting go might be a form of deflecting responsibility. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he engaged in bullying behavior, didn't address the harm properly, and is now resentful that the brother hasn't forgiven him. The author's actions as a child and his current lack of accountability make him the asshole. So the answer should be A.\n"
