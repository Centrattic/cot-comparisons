In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were kids. The brother is still upset after 10 years and had a big emotional outburst. The author feels like the teasing wasn't that bad, didn't mean harm, and even gave him a gift related to anime. Now the brother is cold, and the author is angry about being blamed years later.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. They admit to teasing their brother about his hobbies (specifically anime) when they were younger. They say it was done without malice, but they also acknowledge that they used to tease him a lot. The key points here are that they were teasing, even if not maliciously, and that it caused emotional harm. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling like a weirdo, which indicates that the teasing had a significant negative impact.\n\nThe author might think they're not in the wrong because they didn't intend to hurt their brother and they stopped when they went to university. They also gave a gift that's related to the brother's interests, which they thought was a nice gesture. However, the brother's reaction suggests that the emotional impact lasted a long time and that the author's actions contributed to his brother's feelings of embarrassment and insecurity.\n\nNow, considering the brother's perspective, even if the teasing wasn't physical or overtly cruel, constant teasing about something a person cares about can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem. The fact that the brother still hasn't forgiven them after 10 years shows that the effects were lasting. The author's response to the brother's outburst was to get angry, which might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding for the brother's pain.\n\nOne thing to note is that the author didn't apologize or take responsibility when the brother confronted them. Instead, they got defensive and angry. That can be seen as a problem because it doesn't address the brother's feelings and might make things worse. The author might not realize how their actions affected their brother, but once confronted, the appropriate response would be to listen, apologize, and try to make amends. The author's anger at the brother for not moving on might show a lack of accountability.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their past actions or for being angry now. The key here is whether the teasing was harmful. Even if it wasn't malicious, if it caused significant emotional harm, then the author could be at fault. Additionally, their reaction to the brother's outburst is problematic because they didn't take responsibility but instead got angry.\n\nAnother angle is the brother's current behavior. He did confront the author, which is valid because he was hurt. However, holding a grudge for 10 years might be excessive, but it's understandable given the impact. The author's frustration at the brother not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's feelings.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions did cause harm, and their reaction to the brother's confrontation was not helpful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong both for the past teasing and for their reaction now.\n"
