In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who, as a child and young teen, was a bit of a bully to his younger brother, teasing him about his anime interests. Now, even after 10 years, the younger brother hasn't forgiven him, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they never meant it maliciously and didn't let the brother go to bed upset. But the key point is that the younger brother was affected deeply\u2014crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author is now upset that after a decade, the brother hasn't let it go and is estranged from him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for their past actions and current anger. The author's actions as a child were bullying, even if not malicious. Bullying can have long-lasting effects, even if the perpetrator didn't intend harm. The younger brother's reaction is valid; emotional trauma from childhood can persist. The author's frustration about the brother not moving on might be valid, but they still have responsibility for their past behavior.\n\nThe author is also angry now because the brother hasn't forgiven him. But holding onto resentment is a choice, but the author can't control how the brother feels. The author's current anger might come from their own perspective, not considering the depth of the hurt caused.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong: the author did act in a way that harmed their brother, even unintentionally. So they might be in the wrong for the bullying, but the brother's ongoing anger is his choice. The question is whether the author is the asshole for being angry at the brother's lack of forgiveness. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for either the past actions or the current reaction.\n\nThe answer would hinge on whether the author's actions were wrong. If bullying is considered wrong, even if not malicious, then the author is in the wrong for the past actions. However, the brother's reaction might be excessive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now for being angry. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall.\n\nThe answer is likely A (yes) because even if the author's intentions were good, the actions were harmful and the brother's feelings are valid. The author's current anger might be justified in some way, but the initial bullying is where the wrong occurred. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their past actions, making them the asshole.\n"
