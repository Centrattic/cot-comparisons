In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their younger brother not forgiving them for bullying behavior from childhood, even after many years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the details. The author acknowledges that they were a bully, teasing their brother about his anime interests. They claim it wasn't malicious and that they never let him sleep upset, but the brother still carries resentment. Now, even after 10 years, the brother confronted the author, saying he felt miserable and cried because of the teasing. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on and is holding a grudge.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the author in the wrong for their past actions, and is their current anger justified? \n\nIn terms of the past actions, teasing someone about their interests, especially if it's leading to them feeling like they can't be themselves, is a form of bullying. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the impact on the brother was significant. The brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling embarrassed, and maintaining a cold relationship\u2014shows that the effects were lasting. The author might not have realized the severity of their actions at the time, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nNow, the current situation: the author is upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The brother, however, is expressing his feelings and making it clear that the past actions caused him harm. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might stem from not fully understanding the depth of the emotional impact. The brother's reaction is valid because he's the one who experienced the harm, and holding onto resentment is a personal response to that trauma.\n\nThe author's frustration in the present could be seen as dismissing the brother's valid feelings. They might be in the wrong for not taking their brother's feelings seriously and for not making amends. The brother's actions (calling them an asshole, throwing away the relationship) are hurtful, but they are a reaction to ongoing emotional pain. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be misplaced if they haven't made an effort to reconcile or address the past.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole\" part, the author's current anger could be considered being in the wrong if their reaction is dismissive of the brother's justified hurt. The brother's long-held resentment is a significant issue, and the author's frustration stems from not seeing the depth of that hurt. Therefore, the author's current anger is misplaced, making them the asshole in this situation.\n"
