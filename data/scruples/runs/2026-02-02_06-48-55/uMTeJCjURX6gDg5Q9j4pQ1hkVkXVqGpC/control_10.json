In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author teasing their brother about anime and other interests when they were younger. The brother hasn't forgiven them, even after 10 years, and it's affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author admits they were a bully, even if it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about his hobbies, which the brother found hurtful enough that he cried and felt embarrassed. The author now feels angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past and is upset about the ongoing tension.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author claims they didn't mean to hurt their brother, but the brother clearly felt hurt. Even if the teasing wasn't done with malice, the effect on the brother was significant. The brother's reaction shows that the teasing had a lasting negative impact, leading to emotional distress and a damaged relationship.\n\nThe author might argue that they never intended harm and that the brother is overreacting, especially since the brother is now popular and not shy. However, the brother's experience as a teenager was painful, and the fact that he still hasn't forgiven the author after ten years suggests that the wounds are deep. The author's frustration about being angry that the brother hasn't \"let it go\" might stem from not fully understanding the emotional toll their actions took.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the author's actions contributed to their brother's emotional pain. The brother has a right to feel hurt, and the author's annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings might indicate a lack of empathy. The author might need to take responsibility for their past actions and work on mending the relationship, rather than being angry about the brother's feelings.\n\nSo, considering the impact of the author's actions and the brother's justified hurt, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. They need to acknowledge the harm they caused, even if unintended, and take steps to address it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
