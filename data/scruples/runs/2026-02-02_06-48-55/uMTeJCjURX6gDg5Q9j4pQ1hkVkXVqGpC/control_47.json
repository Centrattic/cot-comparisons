In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author (who is the brother in the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that he used to tease his younger brother about his anime hobbies when they were kids. Now, even as adults, the younger brother hasn't forgiven him, and the older brother is feeling annoyed that his sibling still holds a grudge after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The older brother admits he was a bully, but says it wasn't malicious and he never let their brother go to bed upset. He also mentions they drifted apart after university. The younger brother, on the other hand, says the teasing made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and embarrassment. He's still upset about it even now.\n\nSo, is the older brother in the wrong? Well, bullying, even if not intended to be malicious, can have long-lasting effects. The fact that the younger brother was crying and felt like a \"weirdo\" suggests that the teasing had a real emotional impact. The older brother might not have realized how his actions affected his sibling, but the consequences are there. The key here is whether his actions were wrong, not just his intent.\n\nBut the user is also asking if the older brother is in the wrong for being angry that his sibling hasn't let go of the issue. Here, the older brother is frustrated because a decade later, his brother is still holding onto past grievances. The question is whether the older brother's current anger is justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the older brother's teasing and bullying behavior from years ago is the root of the problem. Even if he didn't mean to hurt his brother, the harm was done. The fact that the younger brother is still upset shows that the older brother's actions had lasting negative effects. The older brother's current frustration might come from not understanding the depth of the hurt, or perhaps he feels the issue should have been resolved long ago. However, holding onto past pain isn't uncommon, especially when it affects one's self-esteem and identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the younger brother might have a responsibility to work towards forgiveness, but that's a personal choice and not necessarily something the older brother can control. The older brother could be in the wrong for not acknowledging the depth of the hurt and for dismissing his brother's feelings by calling the issue trivial.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the older brother's initial actions were harmful, even if unintended. His current frustration might be a way of deflecting from the fact that he contributed to the problem. Therefore, he might still be in the wrong for not taking full responsibility and for not addressing his brother's feelings adequately. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
