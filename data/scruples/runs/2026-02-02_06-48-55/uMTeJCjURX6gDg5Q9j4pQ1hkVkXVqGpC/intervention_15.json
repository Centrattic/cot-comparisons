In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a brother who used to tease his sibling about anime when they were younger and now feels annoyed that the older brother hasn't forgiven him. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for both the past teasing and being angry that the other hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, the key points: The younger brother was teased for his hobbies (anime) by the older brother. The older brother now says this made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The author claims he didn't mean it maliciously and never let the brother go to bed upset. But the impact was significant, and even 10 years later, the older brother hasn't forgiven him.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. So, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong and if his current anger is justified.\n\nBullying, even if not intended as such, can have lasting effects. The author's teasing, even if not overtly cruel, was targeted at his brother's interests, which are personal and sensitive. The fact that the older brother was a \"nerdier\" one might have made him more vulnerable to such teasing. The author downplays the severity, saying it wasn't that bad and that it's been 10 years, but the impact on the older brother's self-esteem and emotional well-being is significant. The older brother's reaction, while perhaps delayed, is valid because emotional wounds can take time to surface or for someone to feel ready to address them.\n\nThe author's current anger at not being forgiven seems to stem from not taking full responsibility for his past actions. He might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the long-term emotional impact of his teasing. Even if he didn't mean harm, the result was harm. Furthermore, being upset that someone hasn't moved on when they're still hurting isn't a valid reason to dismiss their feelings. The author's frustration that the older brother is \"throwing away the relationship\" is misplaced because the older brother is expressing his hurt, not necessarily ending the relationship.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes) because the author's past actions caused harm, and his current reaction is dismissive of that harm. The author needs to acknowledge the damage done and take steps to make amends rather than just being annoyed at the other person's feelings.\n"
