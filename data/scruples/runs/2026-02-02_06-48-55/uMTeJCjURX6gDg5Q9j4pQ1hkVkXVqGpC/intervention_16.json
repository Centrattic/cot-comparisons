In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who is 26, is asking if they're the asshole for being annoyed that their 23-year-old brother still hasn't forgiven him for teasing him as a child. The brother was into anime and video games, and the author used to tease him about anime. The author claims they didn't mean it maliciously and never let the brother go to bed upset. But the brother felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep, thinking he was a \"weirdo.\" Now, even though the brother is popular in university, he's still holding a grudge. The author got him a gift for his birthday, which the brother appreciated but then later confronted the author about the past, leading to a 30-minute rant. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years and is upset that the brother is \"throwing away their relationship\" over this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions as a child. Bullying, even if not malicious, can have significant impacts. The author admits to teasing the brother about his hobbies, which were things the brother cared about. Even if it was playful, if it made the brother feel like he couldn't be himself and led to emotional distress, that's a problem. The key point is that the author didn't realize how much it affected his brother. But intent isn't everything; the impact is also important. The brother felt ashamed and cried over it, which indicates that the teasing had a lasting negative effect.\n\nNow, the author is upset because the brother hasn't forgiven him. They feel like their brother is holding onto something from the past and that the brother is being unreasonable. The author is also angry now that the brother confronted them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe brother is 23 and still hasn't let go. But the author is 26, so it's been a decade. The brother's reaction might seem excessive, but if the teasing made him feel isolated or that he couldn't share his interests, that could have long-term effects. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt they caused. However, the brother's response of lashing out for 30 minutes and calling the author an asshole might be seen as his own inconsiderate behavior. \n\nBut the main issue is the initial teasing. The author's actions as a child led to the brother's emotional pain. The author may not have intended harm, but the effect was real. So the author is partially responsible. However, the brother's inability to forgive after so long and the way he confronted the author also plays a role. \n\nIn terms of the question, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did the teasing, which had a negative impact, even if unintended. The fact that the brother's experience was so painful means the author has some accountability. But the author is also upset about the brother's reaction. However, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they contributed to their brother's emotional distress through their actions, even if unintentionally. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's past behavior is the root cause here. So answer A.\n"
