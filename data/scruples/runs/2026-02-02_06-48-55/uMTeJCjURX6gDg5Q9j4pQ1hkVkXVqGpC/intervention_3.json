In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author, who's 26, was a bit of a bully to his younger brother (now 23) by teasing him about his anime interests when they were younger. The brother still hasn't forgiven him, leading to a recent confrontation on the brother's birthday. The author is annoyed that his brother hasn't moved on after 10 years and feels the teasing wasn't that bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits to being a bully, even if it wasn't malicious. The brother was affected deeply, crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author now gives gifts related to the brother's interests but the brother still holds a grudge. The author is angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's pain is real, even if the author didn't intend it. Bullying, even if not malicious, can have lasting effects. The author's frustration about the brother not moving on might be valid, but the root cause is the author's past actions. The author's current annoyance seems to stem from wanting the brother to forgive him, but the brother's feelings are justified given the impact.\n\nSo, the author's actions as a child/teen were harmful, and while he may not have meant to hurt, the effects are real. The brother's reaction is a result of those actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the initial bullying and for not taking the brother's feelings seriously. Even if the author is upset now, the responsibility lies with him for causing the hurt in the first place. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
