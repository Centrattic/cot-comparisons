In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author admitting to bullying their younger brother by teasing him about his interest in anime and video games during childhood and adolescence. The brother, now an adult, still hasn't forgiven the author and expressed deep emotional pain, including crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed about his hobbies.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that they were a bully, even if they didn't mean it maliciously. Bullying, even if unintentional, can have lasting effects. The brother's emotional response\u2014years of misery and crying\u2014indicates that the teasing had significant negative impacts. The author's defense is that the teasing wasn't malicious and that they didn't realize the effect it had. However, intent doesn't always negate the harm caused. The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nNext, the brother's current reaction: he's an adult and the issue has persisted for 10 years. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on and is cutting off the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for both the past bullying and their current reaction to the brother's unresolved feelings.\n\nThe author argues that the teasing wasn't that bad and that the brother is overreacting. But the brother's testimony suggests real emotional harm. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's trauma. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the fact that they engaged in bullying behavior that caused lasting harm points to their responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the brother's current popularity and confidence at university doesn't negate his past suffering. People can experience embarrassment and internalized shame even if they later become socially accepted. The author's failure to recognize the depth of their brother's hurt and their frustration at the ongoing tension suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nIn terms of the current conflict, the author is angry because their brother hasn't forgiven them, but the brother's feelings are valid given the history. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset about the brother's coldness, but they are in the wrong for the initial bullying and for not taking their brother's feelings seriously enough. The key is that the author's actions caused harm, and their defensiveness now compounds the issue.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions as a child were harmful, and their current reaction shows a lack of accountability. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
