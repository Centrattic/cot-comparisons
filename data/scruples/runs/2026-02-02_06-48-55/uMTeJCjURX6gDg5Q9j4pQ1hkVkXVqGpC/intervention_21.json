In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author used to tease their brother about anime when they were younger, and now the brother hasn't forgiven them. The author feels annoyed because they think it's been 10 years and the brother is still holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were a bully as a child, even if it wasn't malicious. Bullying, even if not intended to be, can have lasting effects. The brother was teased about his hobbies, which made him feel embarrassed and cry. The author's actions, while maybe not done with malice, did cause emotional harm. \n\nNow, the brother finally opened up about how he felt. The author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on. But the brother's reaction shows that the teasing had a significant impact on his self-esteem and social life during their teenage years. The author's reaction is anger at the brother for not letting go, which seems to downplay the brother's feelings. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's past actions caused emotional distress, the brother's valid feelings about being embarrassed, and the author's current frustration with the unresolved tension. \n\nThe author might think their teasing was harmless, but the brother's experience was harmful. The fact that the brother is now in university and popular doesn't negate his past struggles. People can have lasting effects from childhood experiences, especially when it's a sibling relationship. \n\nThe author's anger at the brother for not moving on could be seen as dismissive. They are upset that their brother isn't forgiving them, but maybe they should focus on understanding the brother's perspective. The author might need to take responsibility for their actions and work on mending the relationship rather than being angry about the brother's unresolved feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. They were a bully, even if unintentionally, and their reaction to the brother's hurt feelings is to be angry rather than empathetic. Answer A.\n"
