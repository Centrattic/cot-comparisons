In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being a bit of a bully as a child and now being annoyed that his brother hasn't forgiven him. \n\nFirst, the author admits to teasing his brother about his interests, specifically anime. He says it was never malicious, but the brother was affected deeply. The key points here are intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the effect on his brother was significant\u2014he cried himself to sleep and felt embarrassed. That's serious emotional harm.\n\nThe author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. But the brother explains that the trauma from those years made his teenage years miserable. The author downplays the teasing, saying it wasn't that bad, but the brother's reaction shows it had lasting effects. \n\nThe author's main argument is that he didn't realize the harm and that they haven't been close for a while. However, being a sibling, especially a brother, there's an expectation of mutual respect and support. Teasing to the point of making someone feel like a \"weirdo\" and causing emotional distress is not okay, even if it's seen as harmless by the teaser. \n\nAlso, the author gifts the brother an anime poster, but the brother's reaction indicates that the underlying issues are still present. The author's frustration at the brother not letting go might stem from not fully understanding the depth of the hurt. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who caused the harm usually needs to make amends, not just wait for the other to forgive. The author might still be in a place where they don't see their actions as harmful, which is part of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did do something wrong by teasing his brother in a way that caused lasting emotional damage. He's also wrong for being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him, as it's not up to the victim to let go. The answer should be A.\n"
