In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased by their sibling for liking anime and video games, leading to long-term resentment. The author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously, and now the brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The author is angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledged that they were a bully. Even if they didn't mean to be malicious, the effect on their brother was significant. The brother experienced emotional distress, crying himself to sleep, and feeling embarrassed. These are serious consequences. The author's actions, while maybe not intended, caused lasting harm. \n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable. People can hold onto emotional wounds for a long time, especially siblings. The author's frustration about being angry that the brother hasn't moved on seems a bit self-centered. They're upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them after a decade, but they were the ones who caused the hurt in the first place. The author also gave a gift, which the brother appreciated but still had an emotional outburst. \n\nThe key points here are the author's acknowledgment of their past behavior, the brother's emotional impact, and the author's current anger towards the brother for not letting go. The author might be in the wrong because even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the damage was real. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be misplaced. \n\nBut wait, the author did say they never meant harm and tried to make amends by giving the gift. However, the brother's feelings aren't just about the teasing but the long-term effect on his self-esteem. The author's frustration could stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt. So, the author's current anger is part of the issue here. They're upset because their brother hasn't forgiven them, which might not be their place to decide how the brother should feel. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions as a child caused real harm, and their current anger at the brother for still being upset shows a lack of understanding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
