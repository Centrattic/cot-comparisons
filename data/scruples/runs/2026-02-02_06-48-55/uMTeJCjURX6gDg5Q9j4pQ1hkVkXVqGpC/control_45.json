In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a brother who used to tease his sibling about being into anime and games. Now, years later, the brother is still upset and the author feels annoyed that the issue hasn't been resolved.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to being a bully as a child, even if not maliciously. The brother's feelings were hurt, leading to a cold relationship. The author gave a gift related to anime, which the brother appreciated but there was underlying tension. The brother confronted him, expressing that he felt embarrassed and cried, and the author is now upset that the issue hasn't been resolved after 10 years.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions as a child were bullying, even if not intended to be malicious. The brother's emotional response is valid\u2014childhood experiences can have long-lasting effects. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on, but the brother's feelings are real and justified. The author might not have realized the impact of their actions at the time, but the harm was done. The brother's decision to be upset is his right, and the author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might make them the asshole because they're dismissing the brother's valid emotions. The author should take responsibility for their past behavior and work on mending the relationship, rather than getting angry that the brother is still hurt.\n"
