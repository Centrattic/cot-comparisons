In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is between two brothers where the older one (26) is being accused by his younger brother (23) of bullying him as a child by teasing his interest in anime. The author is now annoyed that the younger brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the nature of the teasing and how it affected the younger brother. The author says he never meant it maliciously and didn't let his brother go to bed upset. But the younger brother claims it made his teenage years miserable, causing him to cry and feel like a \"weirdo.\" Even though the author didn't intend harm, the impact on the younger brother was significant. Teasing someone about their hobbies, especially when it affects their self-esteem, can be harmful. So maybe the author was wrong in his actions.\n\nNext, the author's reaction: he's angry that his brother hasn't let it go. The younger brother expressed his hurt feelings years later, which the author took as being ungrateful, especially since he gave a gift. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the emotional impact. But holding a grudge for 10 years is also an issue. However, the fact that the younger brother felt he had to vent all his anger at the author suggests that the emotional pain was real and unresolved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. His actions as a child were bullying, even if unintentional. The fact that his brother still feels affected shows that the behavior had a lasting negative impact. The author's current anger at the brother not letting go might stem from not taking responsibility for the harm caused. So, the author's actions were wrong, and his reaction to the brother's feelings is also problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
