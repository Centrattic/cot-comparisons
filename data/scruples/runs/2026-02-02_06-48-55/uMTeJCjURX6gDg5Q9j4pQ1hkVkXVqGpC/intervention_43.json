In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who used to tease his younger sibling about his anime interests, and now the younger brother still hasn't forgiven him, even after years. The author is upset because he feels the brother is holding onto past teasing that wasn't meant to be malicious, and he's angry that it's affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the bullying. The author mentions that he \"never meant any of it maliciously\" and didn't let the brother go to sleep upset. But the key here is the impact, not the intent. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to harm, it caused the brother to cry and feel embarrassed. That's significant emotional harm over years. The author downplays the severity of his actions, calling the teasing \"not that bad,\" but the brother's reaction shows it was deeply hurtful.\n\nThen, there's the author's reaction now. He's angry that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. This raises the question of accountability. Just because the author didn't mean to be cruel doesn't mean he's not responsible for the effects of his actions. The brother taking time to process and finally confronting him is a valid response. The author's frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings might stem from a lack of understanding of how trauma or emotional wounds can linger.\n\nAnother point is that the author gave a thoughtful gift, which the brother appreciated but still felt conflicted. The author might believe he's made amends, but the brother's emotional response indicates that the healing isn't complete. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's experience. It's important to acknowledge that the brother's feelings are valid, regardless of the author's intent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the author should recognize the harm caused. The fact that the brother felt the need to confront him after years shows that the emotional impact was real. The author's current frustration might be a defense mechanism, avoiding taking full responsibility for his past actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the initial teasing or for his current anger. Since the initial actions had lasting negative effects, the author is at least partially in the wrong. However, the brother's reaction is also valid, but the focus is on the author's accountability.\n"
