In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who used to tease his sibling about anime when they were younger. Now, years later, the brother hasn't forgiven him, and the author is annoyed that the issue is still bringing up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully as a child, though they say it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about his interests, specifically anime. They mention that they never wanted to make him upset and would ensure he didn't go to bed angry. But over time, their relationship grew distant, and now, when the brother finally confronts him, the author is upset that the issue is still lingering after ten years.\n\nThe big question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's actions as a child\u2014bullying, even if not malicious\u2014could have had a lasting impact. The brother's reaction shows that the teasing affected him deeply, leading to feelings of embarrassment and crying. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect was real. The fact that the brother is still hurt suggests that the author's actions were wrong, regardless of intent. Also, the author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on, which could indicate a lack of understanding about the lasting effects of their behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has tried to make amends by giving gifts related to anime. But the brother felt that wasn't enough. The author might feel it's time to let go, but the brother's feelings are valid. The key here is that the author's past actions, even if unintended, caused harm. The fact that the brother is still upset doesn't automatically make the author the asshole for being annoyed, but the original bullying is the main issue. \n\nSo, considering that the author acknowledges the bullying and the brother's valid emotional response, the author is in the wrong for the initial actions. The anger at the brother not letting it go is a separate issue, but the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Since they did engage in behavior that harmed their sibling, even unintentionally, the answer would lean towards A.\n"
