In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased as a child by his sibling about his anime hobby and still hasn't forgiven him. The author is upset because the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously. Bullying, even if not intended, can have long-term effects. The brother's reaction is that he felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep, which is serious. The author downplays the teasing, calling it \"not that bad,\" but the impact on the brother was significant. \n\nThe author also got angry that the brother isn't letting go after a decade. The brother's feelings are valid\u2014being bullied by a sibling can lead to lasting emotional scars. The author's frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings might be missing the point. The brother's current behavior (being cold, lashing out) is hurtful, but the root cause is the past actions. \n\nThe key points are: the author's past behavior had a negative impact, the brother's valid emotional response, and the author's current annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings. The author might be in the wrong for not fully recognizing the harm caused, even if unintended. Also, being angry about the brother not moving on could be seen as dismissive of the brother's pain. \n\nBut there's also the brother's part. He hasn't forgiven, and maybe he's holding onto anger unnecessarily. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author admitted to bullying, even if not malicious, and the brother's suffering was real, the author is partly responsible. So the answer is likely A.\n"
