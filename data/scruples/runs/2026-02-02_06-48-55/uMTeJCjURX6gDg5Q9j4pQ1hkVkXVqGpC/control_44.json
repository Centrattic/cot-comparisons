In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about a brother who's upset that his sibling hasn't forgiven him for past teasing. The author says he used to tease his brother about anime when they were kids but claims it wasn't malicious. Now, the brother is still holding a grudge, and the author is upset that it's been 10 years and the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong in his actions. He admits to being a bully, even if he didn't mean it maliciously. Bullying is generally considered harmful, regardless of intent. The key here is the impact of his actions on his brother. The brother reported crying himself to sleep and feeling like a \"weirdo,\" which indicates serious emotional distress. Even if the author didn't realize the extent of the harm, the fact remains that his teasing caused significant pain.\n\nNext, looking at the current conflict: the author is angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. But the brother had a valid reason to be upset given the long-term effects of the bullying. The author's frustration for being angry about the lack of forgiveness might be misplaced here. It's not the brother's responsibility to move on immediately; healing takes time. Also, the author's actions as a child have lasting consequences. The brother's reaction is a natural response to deep emotional wounds.\n\nThe author sent a gift, which was well-received, but the brother's resentment was still expressed. The author might feel that he's made amends by giving the gift, but the brother might not feel that the past has been properly addressed. The author might need to take responsibility for his past actions and make a more sincere effort to reconcile, rather than getting angry that his brother hasn't forgiven him.\n\nConsidering all this, the author was indeed in the wrong for his past behavior. While the brother's continued anger is understandable, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the initial bullying was harmful, even if unintended, the author is at fault. His current anger at his brother for not forgiving him is also problematic because it's dismissive of the brother's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
