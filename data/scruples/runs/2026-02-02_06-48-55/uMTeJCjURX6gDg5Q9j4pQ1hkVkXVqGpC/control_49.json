In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing their brother about anime and hobbies when they were younger. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully as a child. They say they teased their brother, even though they didn't mean it maliciously. But the brother was affected deeply, crying and feeling embarrassed. The author seems to downplay the impact, calling the brother's reaction \"ridiculous\" and thinking their teasing wasn't that bad. That's a red flag. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the effect was real and hurtful.\n\nThe brother is still upset after 10 years, which shows the emotional toll it took. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go. But the key point here is that the author's actions caused lasting harm. The fact that the author got a gift for the brother's birthday but was called out for making him feel like a weirdo suggests that the brother's feelings were valid and long-standing.\n\nThe author's response to the brother's outburst is to get angry instead of reflecting on their past behavior. They're more upset about the brother not letting go than acknowledging their role in the pain caused. That's where the issue is. The author is in the wrong because they contributed to their brother's suffering, even if unintentionally, and their reaction now is dismissive of that harm.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to hurt, the impact is real, and their current reaction is part of the problem. Therefore, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) is correct.\n"
