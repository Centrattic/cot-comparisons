In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased for liking anime and other hobbies by his older sibling. The older brother now feels annoyed because his younger brother hasn't forgiven him for the teasing, even years later.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the older brother (the one in the post) was a bully as a child, though he claims it wasn't malicious. He teased his younger brother about his interests in anime. Over time, their relationship became strained, and even after the younger brother (now 23) expressed deep hurt, the older brother is upset that the issue hasn't been resolved after a decade.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The older brother's actions as a child could be seen as bullying, even if not malicious. Teasing someone about their interests, especially if it leads to emotional distress, can be harmful. The younger brother's response shows that the impact was significant\u2014he cried himself to sleep and felt like a weirdo, which affected his self-esteem.\n\nHowever, the older brother is now angry that the younger hasn't moved on. The question is whether the older brother is still in the wrong for his past actions, or if his current anger is justified. The younger brother's emotional response is valid because the effects of bullying can last a long time. The older brother, despite his claims of not being malicious, contributed to his sibling's suffering. Even if the teasing seemed minor to him, the impact was real.\n\nThe fact that the younger brother is still hurt after 10 years suggests that the older brother's behavior had lasting negative effects. The older brother's frustration at not being forgiven might stem from not fully understanding the depth of the emotional harm caused. In this case, the responsibility lies more on the older brother to acknowledge the hurt and make amends rather than being angry about it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions as a child caused significant emotional distress, and his current anger is misplaced. The answer should be A.\n"
