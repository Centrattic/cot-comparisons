In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a brother who used to tease his younger sibling about his anime hobby. The younger brother still hasn't forgiven him, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, albeit not maliciously. He teased his brother's interests, which led to emotional harm. The younger brother mentions crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The key points here are the impact of the teasing over time and the author's current reaction to the unresolved tension.\n\nThe author now feels angry that his brother hasn't let go of the past after 10 years. He doesn't see his actions as harmful, thinking they were just jokes. But the harm caused is real to the brother. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for his past actions or his current reaction.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author acknowledged teasing, which was hurtful, even if unintended. The brother's emotional distress is significant and long-lasting. The author's current anger stems from the brother not moving on, which might be a form of deflection from his own responsibility. The brother's right to feel hurt and not have forgiven him isn't something the author can control. However, the author's insistence that it's not a big deal and his anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author's past actions contributed to the hurt, so he's in the wrong there. His current reaction could be seen as dismissive of his brother's feelings, which also makes him wrong. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
