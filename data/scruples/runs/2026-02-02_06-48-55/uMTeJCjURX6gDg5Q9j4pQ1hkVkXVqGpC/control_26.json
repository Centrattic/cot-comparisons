In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 26, used to tease their younger brother, who's 23, about anime when they were kids. They didn't mean any harm, but the brother says he was crying himself to sleep because he felt embarrassed and that the teasing made his teenage years miserable. The brother still hasn't forgiven them, even after 10 years. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past and is upset about their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously. Teasing someone about their hobbies and interests, especially when they're into something that's seen as niche or different, can have a lasting impact. The brother's feelings of being a \"weirdo\" and crying because of it suggest that the teasing was more harmful than the author realized. Even if it was just banter, if it made the other person feel ashamed, that's a problem.\n\nThe author might think the teasing wasn't that bad because they didn't intend harm, but the key here is the impact on the brother. The brother's reaction now, after years of coldness, shows that the emotional scars are still there. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go could stem from not taking responsibility or understanding the depth of the hurt caused. \n\nAlso, the author gave a gift related to anime, which the brother was thankful but still had a negative reaction. The fact that the brother felt the need to confront the author after all this time indicates unresolved issues. The author's frustration might be valid if they feel ignored or if the brother is being unreasonable, but the initial teasing likely had a significant negative effect that the author didn't consider. \n\nSo, even if the intentions were good, causing someone to feel this way over a decade ago and not acknowledging the harm could make the author at fault. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't negated by the author's lack of intent. The question is whether the author should take responsibility and work on mending the relationship instead of being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them yet.\n"
