In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is about whether teasing a brother about his hobbies as a child makes the author the asshole, especially since the brother hasn't forgiven him even after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author admits to being a bully as a child, specifically teasing his brother about anime and video games. He claims it wasn't malicious, and he never let the brother go to sleep upset. However, the brother now says that this teasing made his teenage years miserable, causing him to cry and feel like a weirdo. The brother is still upset even after 10 years, even though they haven't been close since university.\n\nThe author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of this and is upset about the gift he gave (which was related to anime, a known interest). The author feels he's not in the wrong because he didn't mean harm and thinks the brother is being unreasonable for holding a grudge for so long.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions as a child, the brother's long-term emotional impact, and the current conflict over unresolved feelings.\n\nI need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. Bullying is typically characterized by repeated, intentional harm. The author says he didn't mean it maliciously, but the brother experienced it as harmful. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect on the brother is what matters in determining wrongdoing. The brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling embarrassed, and long-term estrangement\u2014suggests that the teasing had a significant negative impact.\n\nThen there's the current issue: the author is angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him. He's upset that his brother is holding onto past actions and that this has led to a strained relationship. But the author's anger at the brother for not moving on might be another layer of the problem. The brother's feelings are valid, even if the author didn't have ill intent. The author's actions as a child contributed to the brother's pain, and now the author is upset about the brother's unresolved hurt. \n\nThe author might not have realized the extent of his actions' impact at the time, but that doesn't excuse the harm caused. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't diminished by the author's intentions. The fact that the brother is still upset after a decade indicates that the healing process is ongoing, and the author's current anger at the brother for not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's valid feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider taking accountability for his past actions and working on mending the relationship, rather than getting angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him yet. The author's frustration in the present might overshadow the brother's need for reconciliation or apology. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions as a child, even if not malicious, caused lasting harm. His current reaction of anger towards the brother for not moving on could be seen as part of the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong both for his past behavior and his present reaction.\n"
