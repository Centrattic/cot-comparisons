In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person, who's 26, used to tease their younger brother (now 23) about his anime hobbies as a child and young teen. They say they didn't mean it maliciously and never let the brother go to bed upset, but the brother still hasn't forgiven them, even after a decade. The brother confronted them on his birthday, saying that the teasing made his teenage years miserable and he used to cry because he felt like a weirdo. The author is now annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about the confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the nature of the past actions and their impact. The author admits to teasing the brother, which is a form of bullying. Even if it wasn't meant to be malicious, teasing can be hurtful, especially when it's about something the person is passionate about. The brother felt embarrassed and ashamed of his interests because of the teasing, which affected him emotionally for years. The author might not have realized how much it hurt their sibling, but the harm was done regardless of intent.\n\nThe brother's reaction is a result of years of emotional impact. The author might think that because it's been 10 years, the brother should have moved on. However, emotional wounds, especially from family, can linger a long time. The brother's feelings of being a \"weirdo\" and crying himself to sleep show that the teasing had a significant negative effect on his self-esteem and happiness during his formative years.\n\nNow, the author is angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions as a child and young teen were harmful, even if not intentionally malicious. The fact that the brother still feels the impact shows that the author's actions had lasting consequences. The author's current anger might stem from not taking responsibility for the past actions and not understanding the lasting emotional trauma.\n\nSo, the author's wrongdoing is the initial bullying behavior. They didn't realize the extent of the hurt they caused, but that doesn't excuse the actions. The fact that they continued to tease about the same interests, even as an adult, when they now appreciate them, could be seen as insensitivity. The brother's valid reaction to years of emotional harm is not the problem. The author's annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings suggests a lack of empathy for the brother's experience.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for the past actions and for not recognizing the impact of those actions, leading to the current conflict. The answer should be A.\n"
