In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The scenario involves the author teasing their brother about anime and other hobbies as a child and young teen. The brother still hasn't forgiven them, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The author admits to being a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious. Teasing someone about their hobbies, especially when it's a core part of their identity, can be hurtful. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed, which indicates emotional harm. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact matters. Bullying often isn't about intent but the effect on the victim.\n\nThe key points here are the duration and the impact. The teasing went on for years, and the brother's emotional response was significant. The author's defense is that they didn't realize the effect and that they didn't let the brother go to bed upset. However, the brother's experience was ongoing misery, leading to long-term resentment. The author's anger at the brother not letting go after 10 years might be misplaced if the brother's trauma is valid. The author could be in the wrong for not taking responsibility and dismissing the brother's feelings. Alternatively, the brother might be holding onto past issues. But the question is about the author's actions. The author's actions had lasting negative effects, so they might be in the wrong. However, the brother's response could also be excessive. But according to the story, the author didn't apologize or make amends, which could contribute to the brother's hurt. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
