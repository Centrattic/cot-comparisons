In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author claims they never meant any harm and that the brother is now being unreasonable after 10 years. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. The brother was affected deeply, crying and feeling embarrassed. Now, even though the brother is 23 and the author 26, the brother still hasn't forgiven them. The author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about the brother's reaction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, from a psychological perspective, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, being a bully as a child can have lasting effects. The brother's reaction shows that the teasing caused significant emotional harm. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is real. The brother's coldness and eventual outburst indicate unresolved issues. \n\nThe author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go, but holding onto past hurt for 10 years is common in such situations. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's frustration might stem from not taking the brother's perspective seriously. The author's actions contributed to the brother's emotional distress, which is a wrong action regardless of intent. \n\nHowever, the author did make an effort by getting a gift, showing some care. But the core issue is the past bullying. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might stem from a lack of understanding of the lasting impact of their behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions as a child were wrong, even if unintentional. The ongoing effects mean the author is still responsible. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't negated by the author's intent. So, the author is in the wrong for the initial bullying and for not properly addressing the brother's feelings now. The frustration the author feels is valid but doesn't excuse the original behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
