In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bullying their younger brother by teasing him about his anime hobby as a child and young teen. The brother hasn't forgiven him even after 10 years, and now the author is upset that the brother is still holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. They mention they were a \"bit of a bully,\" which is an admission of some level of wrongdoing. Even though they say they didn't mean it maliciously, the brother felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep. That's significant. The author's teasing caused emotional harm, even if unintended. The brother's reaction now shows that the impact was real and long-lasting.\n\nThe author is also angry that the brother hasn't moved on. They think the teasing wasn't that bad and are upset about the strained relationship. But from the brother's perspective, the effect was much more severe. The author's defense that the brother isn't shy now might not matter because the emotional damage was done during their formative years. The fact that the brother took 10 years to confront him shows how deep the hurt is.\n\nThe key points here are the lasting impact of the author's actions and their current reaction. The author might not have intended harm, but the consequences were harmful. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's frustration at not being forgiven doesn't negate their responsibility. The author is in a position where they need to take accountability and work on mending the relationship, not just dismiss the brother's pain. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
