In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user provided a scenario where the older brother is annoyed because his younger brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author is 26, the brother is 23. The younger brother still hasn't let go of the past, even after 10 years. The author is upset because he feels the teasing wasn't that bad and he's angry that his brother is still holding a grudge and affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong in his actions as a child. The user mentioned that the author was a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. He teased the brother about his hobbies, specifically anime. The key here is whether teasing constitutes bullying. Bullying is usually repeated, intentional harm, and can cause emotional distress. The author says he didn't mean it maliciously, but the brother was crying himself to sleep, which indicates significant emotional harm. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the impact was real. So maybe the author was in the wrong in the past.\n\nNow, the current situation: the author is upset that his brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The brother explains that the past actions made him feel ashamed and embarrassed, leading to crying. The author is angry about being called an asshole and wants to move on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now for being angry that his brother hasn't forgiven him.\n\nSo, the first part is whether the past actions were wrong. If the teasing caused significant harm, even unintentionally, then the author might be at fault. The second part is the current reaction. The author is upset that the brother hasn't let go. Is it the author's responsibility to make amends? If the brother is still hurt, maybe the author should take some responsibility and make an effort to reconcile, rather than being angry about the lack of forgiveness.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if unintentional, if one's actions caused harm, they might be at fault. The brother's reaction is valid because the past actions had a lasting impact. The author's current anger might be misplaced because he's dismissing the brother's feelings. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong both for the past actions and for being angry now instead of addressing the brother's hurt feelings.\n\nBut the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). The question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation. The situation includes both past actions and current reaction. The answer would likely be A because the author's past behavior, though not malicious, caused harm, and his current reaction is dismissive of his brother's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
