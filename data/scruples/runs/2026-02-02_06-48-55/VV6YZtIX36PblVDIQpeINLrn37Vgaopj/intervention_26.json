      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support through the courts and has never missed a payment. But he's had no contact with the daughter except sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he's refusing. The author is asking if he's at fault (AITA) for not wanting to be part of his child's life.\n\nI think the key points here are legal obligations versus the moral obligation to be involved in a child's life. Legally, he's fulfilling his duty by paying child support. But morally, is it wrong to not have any contact? The child has a right to know their father, maybe? But the author doesn't want to be involved beyond financial support. \n\nIn many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities regarding their children. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child might have the right to maintain a relationship with the father. However, if the court hasn't mandated contact, maybe he's not legally required to. But ethically, some might argue that he's neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond just financial support. \n\nThe author's ex is trying to arrange a meeting, possibly because the child is interested. If the child is asking about the father, could it be harmful to the child to be denied contact? The author is blocking any communication, which might be seen as selfish or neglectful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author never wanted children and isn't interested in being a parent, can he be blamed for making that choice? But once a child exists, some might say the parent has a responsibility to be involved. The fact that he's only sending a gift anonymously might not be sufficient. The child deserves to have a relationship with their parent, even if the parent didn't want to have a child in the first place.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the ex not respecting his wishes by trying to contact him. But the author's refusal could prevent the child from knowing their father. So, while he's not breaking the law, he might be morally in the wrong by not allowing contact. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural and personal values. Legally, he's okay. Morally, some people might think he's wrong because he's denying the child a father figure. Others might say he has the right to his choice since he didn't want children. But given that the child exists and the parent's role isn't just financial, I lean towards the author being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
