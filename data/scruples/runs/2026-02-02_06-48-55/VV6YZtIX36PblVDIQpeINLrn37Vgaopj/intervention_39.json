      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was confirmed and then broke up. He started paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. However, he hasn't had any contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the mother each year. Recently, the ex called him wanting to meet the daughter, but he refused. He's not sure if the daughter initiated the contact or the ex did, but he's not interested in any interaction.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me recall some legal principles. In many jurisdictions, child support obligations are separate from visitation rights. Just because a parent is paying child support doesn't automatically mean they have the right to have contact. However, in some places, the courts might encourage a relationship between the child and both parents unless it's harmful. But if the parent hasn't been involved, the court might not require it unless there's a specific order. \n\nThe author hasn't been in the child's life beyond financial support. He's not missed any payments, but he's avoiding all contact. The ex is reaching out to arrange a meeting, but he's refusing. Now, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some people might argue that a parent has a responsibility not just financially but also emotionally and to be part of the child's life. But others might say that if the parent was never wanted to be involved and the child is with the mother, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the child is now old enough (seven years) that she might be forming questions about her father. \n\nBut the author is refusing contact even after the ex has made contact. Depending on how the situation was handled legally, if there's no court order requiring contact, he might not be in the wrong legally. But morally, some might see it as neglecting the parent-child relationship. \n\nHowever, the user mentioned that the author has been sending a gift each year. That's a minimal form of contact. The key issue is whether refusing the ex's request for a meeting is wrong. If there's no court order for visitation, then perhaps he's not obligated. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal obligation. \n\nIn some cases, if a parent is refusing contact without a valid reason, it might be seen as harmful to the child. But if the parent has no prior contact and the child hasn't expressed a desire to meet, maybe it's different. However, the ex is the one trying to arrange it, and the author is refusing. \n\nI think in this case, the author is not legally in the wrong if there's no court order for visitation. But morally, some could argue he's avoiding responsibility. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and in many contexts, especially in these types of forums, people often debate the morality and emotional aspects. \n\nBut since the question is about being in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, I need to decide. The author hasn't been involved, but hasn't been blocked by the ex. He's paying support. If the ex is trying to facilitate contact, and he refuses, but there's no legal requirement, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the child is old enough to want to know him, refusing could be seen as harmful. \n\nBut I think the answer here might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong) because even though he's paying child support, he's completely avoiding any relationship. Some people might say that a parent should at least be open to contact for the child's well-being. However, if he's been consistent and the child hasn't had any interaction, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nBut I'm a bit conflicted. The user thinks he's in the wrong. Let me check the original scenario again. The author says he has no interest and told the ex not to contact him again. That seems pretty clear refusal. Depending on legal standards, if there's a right to contact, then he's in the wrong. If not, then not. But since the user is asking from a moral standpoint, perhaps the answer is A. But in some cases, people might argue that it's his right to choose. \n\nBut given that the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the community often responds to these types of scenarios, I think the answer might be A. Because even though he's paying support, he's avoiding all contact, which some might see as neglecting the parental role. So I'll go with A.\n"
