      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He never wanted kids, so he offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months before breaking up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and has never missed a payment. However, he's had no contact with his daughter since, except for sending a birthday gift through the mother. Recently, his ex wants to arrange a meeting with the daughter, but the author refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the ethical and legal aspects here. Legally, the author is fulfilling his obligations by paying child support. There's no mention of any legal requirement for him to maintain contact with the child, so from a legal standpoint, he's compliant. However, ethically, is it right for a parent to completely disengage from their child's life? The author hasn't had any contact, not even trying to build a relationship. The daughter might be curious about her father, and the mother might want to facilitate that. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish or neglectful, even if he's paying financially.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was never in favor of having children. He made that clear by offering an abortion when it was still an option. After the breakup, he chose to step back, which he might feel is the best for everyone, especially if he's emotionally unprepared to be a father. The mother might have other reasons for wanting the meeting\u2014maybe the daughter is inquiring about him, or she's trying to create conflict. But the author's stance is firm in not wanting any involvement.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting the author's wishes and the child's right to know about their biological father. If the author was against having the child from the start, he might feel that getting involved now would be hypocritical, especially if he's not ready to be a parent. However, some might argue that even if he didn't want the child initially, he now has a responsibility to be part of her life, regardless of his personal desires.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. If she's old enough to be curious about her father, not having any relationship could affect her emotionally. The author is giving gifts anonymously, but that's a minimal gesture and doesn't fulfill the role of a father. The author's refusal to engage further might be seen as avoiding responsibility beyond financial support.\n\nBut legally, he's done everything required. The question is whether he's ethically in the wrong. If the mother wants to arrange a meeting, and the author is against it, is that wrong? It depends on cultural or societal norms, but in many cases, it's considered important for a child to have a relationship with both parents, even if one parent is not the primary caregiver. So, the author's stance might be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond just money.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that he made his stance clear from the beginning, didn't pressure the mother, and has been consistent. The mother might have known his position and perhaps is now trying to involve him more, which he's not willing to do. If the mother is pushing for contact without the author's consent, that could be complicating things. But the author's refusal to meet could still be seen as inconsiderate towards the child's needs.\n\nIn summary, while the author is legally compliant, ethically he might be in the wrong for not engaging with his child beyond financial support. The child has a right to know about their father, and the author's complete disengagement could be harmful. However, the author's personal wishes and the circumstances of the child's conception (he didn't want children) might mitigate some responsibility. But generally, parental responsibility includes more than just financial support, so the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
