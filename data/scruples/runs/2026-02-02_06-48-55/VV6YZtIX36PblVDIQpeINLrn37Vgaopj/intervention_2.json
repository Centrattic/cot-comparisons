I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a child with his ex-girlfriend but never wanted kids. He offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They stayed together for four months after the child was born, then broke up. The author has been paying child support and hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending gifts through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he's refusing.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is legal obligations. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically forfeited just because someone didn't want kids. The author might have legal responsibility to support the child, which he's fulfilling, but the question is about the emotional and moral aspect. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, fathers have rights. If the mother is trying to arrange contact, and the father is refusing, depending on the country or state laws, he might be required to allow some level of contact if it's in the child's best interest. The author hasn't had contact for years, which could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the father is avoiding responsibility. The child has a right to know their father, especially if the mother is trying to facilitate that. The father's lack of interest might be seen as selfish, even if he's financially responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's stance could be that he wasn't prepared for parenthood and has made a conscious decision to not be involved. He's providing financially, which is a significant part of child support. However, children often need more than just financial support; they need emotional and social connections. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be involved. But does that make him in the wrong? It depends on societal values. Some might say that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to be involved, regardless of their initial wishes. Others might respect his decision to live his life as he chose, as long as he's meeting the legal obligations. \n\nThe key points here are legal rights versus responsibilities, the child's right to a relationship with both parents, and the father's right to disengage. In many legal systems, the child's best interest is paramount, so if the father is blocking contact, that might be problematic. The father might need to comply with any court orders if the mother requests it through legal channels. \n\nIn the absence of a court order specifying visitation rights, the father might have the legal right to refuse, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), because while he's meeting the financial obligation, he's not fulfilling the emotional and parental role expected by society and possibly the law if the mother is trying to establish contact. But the exact answer might depend on specific laws and cultural norms, which aren't provided here. However, the general consensus from the community might lean towards A.\n"
