I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a child with their ex-girlfriend seven years ago. The author didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but the ex wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. The author has been paying child support consistently but hasn't been involved in any other way. Now, the ex wants them to meet their daughter, and the author refuses, asking not to be contacted again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibilities. In many places, even if a parent doesn't want to be involved, they are still legally obligated to pay child support, which the author is doing. However, there's also the aspect of parental rights. The author might be denying visitation rights if they have legal custody. But since they haven't been involved, maybe the ex has sole custody. If that's the case, the author's refusal to have contact might not be legally wrong, but ethically?\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author didn't want the child from the start and has taken the position of a financial provider rather than a parent. Some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility to be involved in their life, not just financially. Others might say that if the parent is uninterested and the child is being raised by the other parent with support, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be more involved. \n\nBut then again, the child has the right to know their father, especially as they get older. The author's lack of involvement could affect the child's emotional well-being. However, the author's stance is that they never wanted children, so maybe they feel it's not their role. There's also the aspect of the ex potentially being the one who initiated the breakup, so maybe the author isn't at fault for the situation.\n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's often a matter of societal expectations. The author is fulfilling the legal duty (child support) but not the emotional or parental role. Some might see this as neglecting a responsibility beyond just money. Others might respect their honesty in knowing they don't want to be a parent. It's a complex issue without clear right or wrong answers. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" I need to consider common perspectives. In many cases, people are criticized for disengaging from their child's life entirely, even if they provide financially. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. However, if the author has no legal visitation rights or if the ex has full custody, maybe not. But the question doesn't specify custody details, so assuming standard legal scenarios where the father has some rights, refusing to engage despite ongoing payments could be seen as being in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
