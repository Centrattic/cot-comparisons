I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting to be part of their child's life. They impregnated their girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion which she declined, they stayed together briefly, then broke up. They've paid child support consistently but have had no contact. Now the ex wants them to meet the daughter, and they refuse.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: Child support is about financial responsibility, not parental involvement. Legally, they might be meeting their obligations by paying, but parental rights and responsibilities can be more nuanced. Depending on jurisdiction, there might be rights for the child to have a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason for restriction. However, since they haven't been involved, the court might not enforce visitation if it wasn't established.\n\nEthically, this is murkier. The child has a right to know both parents, but the father's stance is that he never wanted children. However, the child's existence is a reality now, and the father's refusal might impact the child's well-being. The mother is trying to facilitate contact, which the father is resisting. The father's actions (sending gifts anonymously) suggest some level of acknowledgment but no real engagement.\n\nThe father's argument is about personal choice and not wanting to be a parent. But once a child is born, some legal and moral responsibilities extend beyond finances. The question is whether contributing financially is enough. If the father is blocking contact that the child might want, especially if the mother is open to it, that could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nHowever, if there are valid reasons the father doesn't want contact (like not being ready, mental health issues, or past conflicts), that's different. The scenario doesn't mention any such reasons, just a stated lack of desire for children. In that case, the father might be prioritizing his own wishes over the child's potential needs. So ethically, the father might be in the wrong. Legally, it's possible he's not violating any laws, but morally, there's room to argue he's not fulfilling his parental role beyond financial support. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
