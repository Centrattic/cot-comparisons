I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want kids, his girlfriend wanted to keep the baby, they broke up, and he's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal and moral obligations here. Legally, child support is a requirement, and he's been paying. But in terms of parental rights and responsibilities, even if he's not the primary caregiver, he's still the biological father. Depending on the country's laws, fathers might have legal rights to be involved in their child's life. However, he's been avoiding contact entirely. That's a key point.\n\nMoral-wise, some people might argue that a parent should have a relationship with their child, regardless of their initial feelings. Others might say that if he didn't want to be involved, it's his right, especially since he's fulfilling financial responsibilities. But others could see it as neglectful. The fact that he sends a birthday gift anonymously might be seen as a minimal effort, but not enough for a real relationship.\n\nHe's also blocking the ex's attempts to arrange a meeting. While he has the right to not be involved, the mother might have a say in the child's exposure to the father, especially if the child is old enough to be curious. The conflict here is between the father's right to not be a parent and the child's right to know their father.\n\nI should also consider the child's age. The daughter is 7 years old now. At that age, children might start wanting to know about their father, so the ex's request could be in the child's best interest. But the father is refusing contact. That might be seen as neglecting the child's needs.\n\nHowever, the father's stance is that he never wanted children. That's a personal choice, but once a child exists, there's a responsibility. The question is whether providing financial support alone is enough. In many societies, emotional and parental involvement is considered part of being a parent.\n\nSo, legally, he's meeting his obligations. Morally, there's a gray area. If the mother is pushing for contact and the father is completely refusing, it might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's well-being. The line between personal choice and parental duty is being tested here.\n\nIn some cases, courts might require visitation if it's in the child's best interest. Since the father is not opposing contact but is actively refusing, he might be in the wrong by not engaging, even if he wasn't the one to initiate. The fact that he's not interested in meeting the child despite being financially responsible could be seen as prioritizing his own preferences over the child's needs.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's a parent who is fulfilling only the financial aspect but refusing any emotional or personal involvement, which is necessary for a child's development. The answer should be A.\n"
