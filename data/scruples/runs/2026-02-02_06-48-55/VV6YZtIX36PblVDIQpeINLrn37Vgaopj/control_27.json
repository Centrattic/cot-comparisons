I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months. He's been paying child support, but has no contact, only sends a birthday gift anonymously. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he's the legal father. Not having contact might not be illegal if he's meeting child support obligations, but there might be laws about visitation or the child's right to know their parent. However, since he's not being forced to have contact, maybe legally he's okay.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The child has the right to know their parent, but the father's right to personal choice is also considered. He didn't want to be a father, but becoming a father is a natural consequence of having a child. So there's a conflict between the father's autonomy and the child's interests.\n\nThe father's actions could be seen as selfish, not engaging with his child's life. On the other hand, he's providing financially, which is a responsibility. But emotional and relational aspects are important too. The mother might feel it's in the child's best interest to have a relationship with the father, but the father isn't compelled to agree.\n\nThe community's typical response to such dilemmas often varies. Some might argue the father is wrong for not trying to build a relationship, others might say he's not wrong if he made that choice upfront. The key points here are the father's consistent disinterest, the legal compliance, and the child's age\u2014seven years old, which is old enough to start understanding family connections.\n\nThere might be a cultural angle too. In some cultures, parental responsibility includes more than just financial support. The answer might depend on societal norms about parenting. Also, the mother's role in pushing for contact\u2014maybe she's trying to reconcile the child's need with the father's refusal.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, he might not be in the wrong, but ethically, many might think he is. The question is whether being in the wrong is about legal obligations or moral/social expectations. Since the user is asking if the author is \"in the wrong,\" which usually refers to moral wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. However, the original scenario says he's paying support and not interfering, so maybe some see it as his right. But the child's right to a relationship complicates it. I think the community usually sides with the child's best interest, so the author might be considered in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
