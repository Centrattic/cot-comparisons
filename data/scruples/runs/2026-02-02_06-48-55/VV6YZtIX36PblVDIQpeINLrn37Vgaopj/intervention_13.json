I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with the child. Now his ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is required, but legal custody and visitation rights might be another matter. If the court didn't grant him visitation rights, then maybe he's not legally obligated to have contact. But even if he's not legally required, there's an ethical angle. The child has a right to know their biological father, even if the parent isn't interested. The author might be avoiding his parental responsibilities beyond financial ones.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons. He didn't want children, and maybe the situation was traumatic or he's not ready to be a father. But the fact that he's paying child support but avoiding any relationship could be seen as selfish. The child's well-being should be a priority, even if the author isn't interested in a relationship. The ex is trying to facilitate contact, which the author is blocking.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could affect the child's emotional development. Not having a relationship might lead to questions and confusion for the child later on. The author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate towards both the child and the mother's wishes.\n\nBut legally, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's fulfilling his financial obligations. However, morally and ethically, there's a case to be made that he's neglecting his parental duties beyond just money. The line between legal and moral responsibility is important here. The answer might depend on societal expectations and the impact on the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's choosing not to engage in any relationship with his child, which goes beyond just financial support. Even if it's legal, it's ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
