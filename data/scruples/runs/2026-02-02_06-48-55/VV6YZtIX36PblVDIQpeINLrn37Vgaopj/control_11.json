I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago but didn't want kids, so he offered to pay for an abortion. She decided to have the child, and they stayed together for four months before breaking up. The author has been paying child support and has had no contact with the daughter since. The ex recently tried to arrange a meeting, which he refused. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal obligations to support their children financially, which he's fulfilling, but also have rights. However, if the parent is not the one the child is living with (non-custodial), they might still have rights to visitation. The author hasn't had any contact, so maybe he's giving up his visitation rights. But if he's never been involved, does he have those rights in the first place? Maybe the court established the support without visitation rights. But if the court didn't address visitation, the ex might be trying to facilitate contact now.\n\nEthically, the author is providing financially but not emotionally or in terms of relationship. The child has a right to know their father, even if he doesn't want to be involved. The author's refusal to meet might be seen as selfish, especially if the child is reaching out. However, if the author genuinely doesn't want to be a father and there's no legal requirement for visitation, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might argue that the child's well-being is more important, others might say the author has the right to choose not to be a parent beyond financial obligations. But since he's the biological father, there's a moral argument that he should at least engage. However, he has been supporting the child, which is a key part of being a parent legally. The fact that he's avoiding any contact beyond gifts might be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities. So I'm leaning towards A (in the wrong) because even though he's paying support, a parent has a moral obligation to have some relationship, even if it's not a lot. But maybe the law doesn't require it unless visitation was enforced. Hmm. The answer might depend on cultural or legal norms. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not just legally, but socially or morally, probably A.\n"
