I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He pays child support and hasn't had contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since he's been paying child support and it's through the courts, he might have legal obligations. But maybe he doesn't have custody or visitation rights. If he hasn't been involved, maybe the court didn't order him to have contact. But in some places, even if you're not the custodial parent, you might have rights to see your child unless there's a court order restricting it. So if he's been avoiding contact, that might be legal but could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author says he doesn't want any part in his daughter's life. The child is seven now, and he's sent a birthday gift but no direct contact. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting. The author is refusing. Some people might argue that a parent has a responsibility to be involved in their child's life, regardless of their initial wishes. Others might say that if the father wasn't part of the life, maybe he doesn't want to disrupt the child unnecessarily. But the child might have a right to know her father, even if he didn't want kids.\n\nThe ex's role is also a factor. If the author and ex are amicable, maybe the ex is trying to give the child an option. But if the author is a negative factor, maybe the ex is justified. However, the author hasn't been harmful, just absent. So the question is, does the father have a responsibility to at least allow the possibility of a relationship with his daughter?\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might say yes, he's in the wrong because he's denying the child a potential parent. Others might say he's not in the wrong because he's fulfilling financial support and the mother had the right to the child. But if the child wants to know him, is it right to refuse? Also, the author's lack of interest could affect the child's emotional well-being.\n\nLegally, if there's no court order for visitation, maybe he's not in the wrong. But morally, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parental responsibility. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer would hinge on whether fulfilling financial obligations is enough or if parental involvement is required.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though he's paying support, a parent's responsibility is more than financial. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, unless there's a valid reason to deny it. The author's refusal without a good reason could harm the child. But if there are legal grounds, maybe not. But the scenario doesn't mention any legal restrictions. So ethically, he's in the wrong.\n"
