I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who got his girlfriend pregnant when he didn't want kids. He offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together briefly after the pregnancy was decided, then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently but has had no contact with the child and only minimal involvement, like sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting to be involved. The user thinks he might be in the wrong. Let me think through the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nFirst, legally, child support obligations are clear. He's been fulfilling them, so there's no legal issue there. But child support doesn't equate to parental involvement. Legally, he might not be required to have contact unless a court orders it. However, ethically, it's a different issue. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. There's a moral argument that the father has a responsibility to be part of the child's life, not just financially.\n\nThe father hasn't had any contact beyond the birthday gift. That's very minimal. The ex might be trying to connect the child with the father, possibly because the child is curious. The father is cutting off all communication, which could be harmful to the child's well-being in the long run. Even if he didn't want the child, he became a parent and thus has responsibilities beyond just money.\n\nBut then, the father's stance is that he never wanted children. Maybe he's being honest about his lack of desire to be a parent. However, by fathering a child, he does have a responsibility. The fact that he's been paying support shows some level of accountability, but not engaging emotionally or relationally could be seen as neglecting the child's needs for a parental relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, many would say that parents have a duty to be involved in their child's life. The father's refusal to meet could prevent the child from forming a relationship, which could affect her emotionally and psychologically. On the other hand, if the father is truly not capable of being a present parent and his presence could be harmful, maybe it's better for the child to have a good relationship with the mother and not have a toxic or absent father figure.\n\nBut in this case, the father isn't being toxic; he's just absent. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and the father is rejecting it. It's possible that the child is looking for him, which could lead to confusion if the mother isn't providing accurate information. The father's refusal might be causing more harm than good.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the father is legally compliant with support, he might be ethically in the wrong for not engaging in any meaningful way with his child. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible, unless there's a reason not to. Since there's no mention of abuse or neglect, it seems the father is choosing not to be involved, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n"
