I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had a girlfriend who got pregnant. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was known and then broke up. He's been paying child support every month without missing a payment. He hasn't had any contact with his daughter, except for sending a birthday gift through the mother each year. Now, the ex wants to arrange a meeting with the daughter, and the author is refusing to get involved again.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or socially. The daughter is almost 7 years old now, so she might be curious about her father. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, but the author is against it. \n\nIn many places, parents have rights to their children, but when there's no contact, it can be more complicated. If the author has been absent and not involved in the child's life, a court might see his refusal to engage as a reason to not grant him visitation. However, the ex might want to introduce the father to the child, especially if the daughter is asking about him. \n\nThe author's stance is that he never wanted children and is happy paying support but not involved otherwise. Some people might argue that a child has a right to know their father, even if the father isn't interested. On the other hand, others might say that if he's been a responsible parent by paying support but not wanting to get involved, he's not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut there's a difference between paying child support and being a parent. Parenting involves more than financial support. The author hasn't been present in the child's life, which could affect the child's well-being. Courts often prioritize the child's best interest, which might include having a relationship with both parents if possible. \n\nHowever, since the author is not interested and has refused to meet, he might be seen as denying the child that right. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's not considering the child's needs. But then again, if he's not a willing participant, can the court force him to be involved? That's a legal question, but the Reddit question is about whether he's in the wrong in terms of social norms or morality.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community tends to look at intention and consequences. The author's intention was not to have children, and he's fulfilling the financial responsibility. But the consequence is that the child is without a father figure. However, the mother is the one trying to connect them, so maybe the author isn't the one pushing for contact. Still, the fact that he's refusing when the mother is trying might be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the key points are: he's responsible for child support but not contact, the child might be seeking a relationship, and he's denying that. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could vary. But in the context of AITA, where the community often emphasizes responsibility towards children, he might be considered in the wrong for not wanting to be involved at all. So the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B if the community sees that he's not obligated to be involved beyond support. Hmm.\n"
