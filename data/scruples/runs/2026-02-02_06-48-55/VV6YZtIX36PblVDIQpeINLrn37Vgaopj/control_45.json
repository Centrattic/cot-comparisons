I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. He didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months and then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. However, he's had no contact with the child and only sends a birthday gift anonymously. Now his ex wants to set up a meeting, and he refuses, asking her not to contact him again about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since he's been paying child support, there's a legal obligation there. But legally, does he have a duty to be involved in the child's life beyond financial support? In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities, including visitation. However, if there's no court-ordered visitation, maybe the father isn't obligated to have contact. But if the mother is seeking visitation, maybe the father's refusal could be challenged in court. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nMoral-wise, this is more subjective. The father didn't want the child and took steps to avoid parenthood, but he took responsibility by paying child support. However, completely cutting off contact might be seen as selfish. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want to be a parent. But the father might argue that he never wanted to be a parent and is fulfilling his obligations as he sees fit. \n\nThere's also the consideration of the child's well-being. Being raised without a father figure can have social and emotional impacts. The mother's desire to connect the child with the father might stem from the child's interest or the mother's belief that the father should be part of the child's life. The father's refusal could be seen as denying the child that relationship. However, the father might not be equipped to be a parent and his presence could cause more harm than good if he's not emotionally prepared.\n\nAnother angle is the initial situation: the father didn't want the child and tried to avoid it, which could imply a lack of commitment. Now, after seven years, the mother is trying to involve the father, which the father resists. The father's stance might be considered selfish because he's prioritizing his own desires over the child's potential needs. On the other hand, if the father isn't prepared to be a parent, forcing contact could be harmful.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong if there's no court-mandated contact. Morally, it's complicated. Some might argue that a parent has a responsibility beyond financial support, while others might understand his stance if he didn't want to be a parent. However, the child's right to know their biological father is a strong point. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parental responsibility. In many societies, there's an expectation that biological parents should have some level of involvement, so the father's complete disengagement could be viewed negatively.\n"
