I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, but offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to keep the baby, they stayed together four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support but has no contact otherwise. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting with the author and their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal rights and responsibilities. By paying child support, the author is fulfilling his legal duty, but does that mean he's required to have contact? Some jurisdictions require non-custodial parents to maintain contact, but it varies. If the author hasn't had contact and the ex isn't seeking court-ordered visitation, maybe he's within his rights.\n\nThen there's the moral perspective. The author didn't want the child, but he fathered one. Does he have a moral obligation to be involved? This is subjective. Some people might argue that contributing to a child's life is important, while others might respect his right to not want it. However, completely cutting off contact could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nThe daughter is now seven, so she might be forming questions about her father. The ex might be trying to get the author involved because the child is curious. The author's stance is firm, but maybe he's being selfish. On the other hand, he might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved, perhaps personal issues or not wanting to disrupt the child's life.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong since he's paying support. Morally, it's more gray. The answer hinges on whether the user's question is about legal correctness or moral responsibility. The question says \"AITA\" which often leans into moral judgment. But since the user asks if the author is \"in the wrong,\" without specifying, I need to consider both.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole?\" contexts, the community tends to consider both legal and moral aspects. However, the author's complete disengagement might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's his right, the moral obligation to the child's well-being could make him the AITA. But others might argue his right to autonomy. However, the consensus often leans towards the parent having a duty to engage, so maybe A is the answer here.\n"
