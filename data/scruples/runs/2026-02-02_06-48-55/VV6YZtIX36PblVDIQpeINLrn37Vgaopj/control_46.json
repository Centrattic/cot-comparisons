I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months, he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the child, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's been paying child support, which is his responsibility. However, in some places, the parent can be required to have contact with the child unless there's a court order limiting that. But here, he hasn't been involved at all. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. The child has a right to know her father, but the father claims he never wanted children. \n\nBut maybe there's a point where even if he didn't want kids initially, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The fact that he's been paying support but avoiding contact might be seen as neglecting a parental responsibility beyond just financial. However, if the mother has sole custody and he's not been part of the child's life, maybe he's not legally obligated to have contact unless the court orders it. \n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives. Some might say he's wrong for not wanting any contact, while others might respect his original wishes. But since he's the father, even if he didn't want kids, once the child was born, there's an argument that he should at least be willing to have some relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's been consistent in not wanting contact and there's no legal requirement for him to have it, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the ex is trying to establish contact now, and he's refusing without a good reason, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key points are: financial responsibility fulfilled, no contact, and now refusal to engage. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong, but ethically, some might say he is. The answer might be A (wrong) because as a parent, even if not wanted, there's a responsibility to acknowledge the child's existence. But others might say he's not wrong since he's been paying and not blocking contact entirely (sending gifts through the mother). \n\nHmm. The gift part is interesting. He's acknowledging the child's birthday but not engaging directly. Maybe that's a middle ground. But if the mother wants him to meet, and he refuses, he's not fulfilling any further role. The community in AITA threads often considers the child's best interest. So if the child wants to know the father, the father's refusal could be seen as wrong. But if the child doesn't know about him and the mother hasn't pushed it, maybe not. \n\nBut the ex is trying to arrange a meeting now. If the father refuses, he's blocking the possibility. So maybe AITA would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's denying the child a relationship. However, if the child is young and hasn't expressed interest, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is A because as a parent, even if he didn't want the child, he has a moral responsibility to consider the child's needs. Refusing to engage beyond money is seen as wrong in many communities.\n"
