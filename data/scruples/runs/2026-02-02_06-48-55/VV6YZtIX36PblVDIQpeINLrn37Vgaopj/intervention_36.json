I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author of the post is a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, she chose to keep the baby, they broke up, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks not to be contacted again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is the parent's legal obligation regardless of relationship status. So he's fulfilling that. But legal obligations don't necessarily cover custody or visitation rights. If the mother has primary custody, she might have the right to make decisions about the child's contact with the father. However, if the father has never been involved, there might be complexities. Some jurisdictions allow non-custodial parents certain rights unless there's a court order restricting it.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The father has accepted financial responsibility but emotionally disengaged. The child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The father's refusal might be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's needs. But he might argue that he never wanted children and isn't equipped to be a parent. However, some might say that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility beyond just financial support.\n\nThe mother's role is also important. She might feel it's in the child's best interest to have a relationship with the father, especially if he's willing to be involved now. But if he's been absent and resistant, the mother might need to consider what's best for the child's well-being. The father's sudden disinterest in meeting could be hurtful if the child is curious about him.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's often an expectation that both parents contribute to their child's life, not just financially. The father's position that he never wanted children could be seen as a personal choice, but once a child is born, responsibilities extend beyond finances. His lack of engagement might be viewed as neglectful, especially if the child is seeking a relationship.\n\nHowever, there might be valid reasons for his stance. If he truly never wanted children and feels unprepared, it's a difficult situation. But as the child grows, his absence could impact her emotionally. Some might argue that he's in the wrong because he's denying the child a relationship with a parent, while others might empathize with his lack of desire for parenthood.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The key points are the legal obligation vs. emotional/ethical responsibilities. The father's refusal to engage could be harming the child's well-being. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there are exceptions, like if a court has already established no contact. Since the post doesn't mention that, maybe not. So, the author is in the wrong because he's denying the child a relationship with a parent, even if he didn't want the child initially.\n"
