I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author impregnating his girlfriend seven years ago, not wanting children, offering an abortion, then breaking up after four months. He pays child support but has no contact with his daughter, only a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. The user pays child support, which he hasn't missed. Legally, that's his duty, so he's fulfilling that. But what about parental rights? In many places, once you're a parent, you have certain rights and responsibilities. By never being involved, he might be neglecting those rights, but legally, he might still be meeting the financial part.\n\nEthically, the author is choosing not to have any relationship with his child. Some might argue that a parent has a moral duty to be involved in their child's life, regardless of personal desires. The fact that he sends a gift anonymously might be a small gesture, but it's not a relationship. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, which could be the child's way of reaching out, but the author is refusing contact. \n\nHowever, the author wasn't the one who wanted the child. He didn't want kids, and the mother did. The breakup was after four months, so maybe he felt justified in stepping back. There's also the aspect of consent and the mother's decision. But once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities aren't optional in most ethical frameworks. \n\nThe key points are: legal compliance (child support), emotional/ethical neglect (no relationship), and the child's potential right to know their father. The author is legally okay but ethically questionable. Some might say he's in the wrong for not engaging, others might say he's not, given his initial stance against children. But the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong because parental responsibility goes beyond financial support.\n"
