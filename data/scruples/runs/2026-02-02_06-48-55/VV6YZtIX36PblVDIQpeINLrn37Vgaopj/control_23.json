I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, child support is required regardless of contact, so the author fulfilling that part is good. But legally, is a parent required to have contact? I think in some jurisdictions, parents have the right to refuse visitation unless ordered by the court. So if there's no court order for him to be involved, he's within his legal rights.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The child has a right to know their father, but the father has the right to decide not to be involved. The author has always been clear about not wanting children, so maybe he's consistent in his stance. However, some people might argue that it's selfish to cut off a relationship when the child can't choose. But the author has been paying child support, which covers financial responsibility, but not emotional or parental.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer depends on cultural or personal morals. Legally, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, some may judge him, but others might respect his decision based on his initial stance. The key points are that he's meeting financial obligations and hasn't forced contact, but he's choosing not to be part of the child's life. Depending on the perspective, the answer could lean either way, but since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" and legally he's not violating anything, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. However, some might argue that as a parent, he has a moral duty to be involved. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, so I need to see which side is stronger. The author hasn't missed payments and has a right to refuse contact unless mandated. So B.\n"
