I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding their involvement with their child.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want children and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support without missing a payment, but has no contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, which he refuses.\n\nSo, from a legal perspective, the author is fulfilling his financial obligations. But what about parental rights and responsibilities? In many places, even if you're not the custodial parent, you have certain rights and responsibilities towards your child. The author is cutting off all contact, which might be legal, but is it ethical or morally right?\n\nThe daughter is now seven years old. At this age, children might start wondering about their other parent. The author isn't engaging in any visitation or communication, which could be seen as neglecting a parental duty. However, he did not want children initially and chose to have child support through the courts. \n\nBut some might argue that having a relationship with a child is a basic right of the child, not just the parent's choice. The author's refusal could be impacting the child's emotional well-being. But others might say that the author has the right to choose not to be involved, especially if it was never his intention to have a child. \n\nLegally, he's meeting his obligations by paying support. Morally, it's more complex. If the ex is trying to arrange a meeting because the daughter is asking about the father, the author's refusal might be seen as selfish or harmful to the child. However, if the author has made it clear that he doesn't want contact, and the ex is persisting, there might be conflicting responsibilities. \n\nBut the author's actions\u2014sending a gift anonymously\u2014might not be enough. True involvement would require more than just a gift. The key points are: he pays support but no contact. The child has a right to know their father, but the father has a right to opt out. However, many ethical systems would prioritize the child's best interest, which in this case could mean the father being involved. So, is the author in the wrong? If the law allows him to refuse contact, then legally he's not wrong. But ethically, some might say yes. The question is whether the answer should be based on legal or moral grounds. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which could imply both. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that parents maintain some relationship unless it's harmful. The author's refusal might be seen as neglecting that duty. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong). However, others might argue that he is not in the wrong because he didn't want the child and is fulfilling his financial responsibilities. It's a tough call. But considering that the child's well-being is a priority, and the father is actively avoiding any relationship, the answer is likely A.\n"
