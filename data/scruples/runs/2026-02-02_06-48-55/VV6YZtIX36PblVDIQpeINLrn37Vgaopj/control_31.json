I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person impregnated their girlfriend seven years ago. They didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after four months, and the author has been paying child support but has no contact with their daughter. Now, the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically given up just because the parents are not married. Even if the author was against the pregnancy but paid child support, they might have legal rights as a parent. Refusing contact might not be legally sound, but the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. However, sometimes legal and ethical considerations overlap.\n\nEthically, the author is the parent, and not having any contact with the child could be seen as abandoning them. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want children. The author provided financial support but no emotional or parental presence. That might be considered neglectful. On the other hand, the author had reservations from the start, and maybe they feel it's better for the child not to have a father who isn't interested. But that's a bit of a cop-out.\n\nAlso, the author sends a birthday gift through the mother, which is a small gesture, but doesn't engage in any real relationship. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, but the author refuses. The author claims they don't want to be involved. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that as a biological parent, they have a responsibility to be part of the child's life. Others might say that if they never wanted children, they shouldn't have gotten someone pregnant. However, the fact that they offered child support shows some responsibility, but not emotional involvement. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's well-being. Having both parents in their life, even if it's a difficult situation, could be beneficial. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish, prioritizing their own wishes over the child's needs. \n\nBut then again, the author might believe that their absence is better for the child, thinking that a disinterested parent is worse than none. However, that's a common argument in such cases, but studies suggest that children benefit from relationships with both parents, even if there are challenges. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not fulfilling their parental role beyond financial support. That's usually considered wrong because being a parent isn't just about money; it's about love, guidance, and presence. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
