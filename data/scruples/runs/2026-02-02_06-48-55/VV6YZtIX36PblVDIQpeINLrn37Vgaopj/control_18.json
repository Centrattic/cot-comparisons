I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He pays child support, never missed a payment, but has no contact with the daughter. He sends gifts anonymously through the ex. When the ex wants to arrange a meeting, he declines and asks not to contact him again. He's unsure if the child or the ex initiated the meeting request.\n\nSo, legal perspective: In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities. The author is paying child support, which he's fulfilling. However, courts often encourage parental involvement unless it's harmful. If a parent is unreachable or uninvolved, the other parent might seek custody or visitation changes. But the author hasn't been involved, so maybe the ex is trying to get him to engage now.\n\nEthical perspective: The child has a right to know their father, even if the author doesn't want to be involved. Withholding relationship might affect the child's well-being. The author is fulfilling financial obligations but not emotional or parental ones. Some might argue he's neglecting his parental duties beyond money. Others might say he was against the pregnancy initially and stayed for support, but now wants no part.\n\nPossible arguments: The author isn't abusive or harmful, just disengaged. However, children benefit from having both parents involved if possible. The author's refusal to meet could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own desires over the child's needs. On the other hand, if the author is not in a good position to parent and the child is better off with the mother, maybe it's not his fault. But the question is about being in the wrong, not whether it's the best scenario.\n\nLegally, he might not be in the wrong because he's paying support and hasn't been blocking contact beyond not initiating it. But ethically, he's avoiding responsibility beyond financial. The answer might depend on the balance between legal obligations and moral duties. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the ethical angle leans towards A (in the wrong) because he's refusing to engage with his child despite the child's right to a relationship. But legally, maybe not. However, the question likely focuses on moral responsibility. So the answer is A.\n"
