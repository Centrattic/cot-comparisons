I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. The situation is that he got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together briefly, then broke up. He's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter, only sending gifts through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, in many places, a father has certain rights and responsibilities. He's been paying child support, which he's done well, but he hasn't had any contact. The child has a legal right to know both parents if possible. However, the father's lack of interest is a key point here. From an ethical standpoint, some might say that as a parent, he has a responsibility beyond financial support. Children often need emotional and social bonds with both parents. On the other hand, if he never wanted a child and has been respecting the legal support obligations, maybe he's not at fault for not wanting to be involved. But there's also the argument that by creating a child, he has a responsibility to both support and be present, even if he didn't want to have kids initially. The fact that he's avoiding contact entirely might be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The ex is trying to facilitate a relationship, which could be in the child's best interest. The father's refusal might be denying the child the opportunity to know her father. However, the father could have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved, perhaps due to the circumstances of the pregnancy or personal issues. But legally, in some jurisdictions, a parent can't entirely cut off contact without some legal consequences if the child has a right to see both parents. The answer might depend on specific laws, but generally, the consensus might lean towards the father being in the wrong for not wanting to engage, even if he's fulfilling financial obligations. So, the answer might be A.\n"
