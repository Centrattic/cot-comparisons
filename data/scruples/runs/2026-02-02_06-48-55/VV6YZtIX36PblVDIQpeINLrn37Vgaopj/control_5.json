I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. The situation is that the author had a child with a former girlfriend, paid child support, but has never had contact. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. The author has been paying child support as required by the court, so legally, they're meeting their financial responsibilities. However, in many places, parents have a legal duty not just financially but also to maintain a relationship with their child unless there are extenuating circumstances. So if the author is blocking contact entirely, that might be a legal issue. But maybe in some jurisdictions, the mother has primary custody and can prevent contact, but that's less common.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. Children generally benefit from having a relationship with both parents. The author is not providing any emotional or physical presence, which could be harmful. Even if they don't want a close relationship, some level of involvement might be necessary. The author mentions sending a birthday gift, but that's minimal. The child might feel confused or hurt by the lack of interest.\n\nThe author claims they've never wanted children, but once a child is born, parental responsibilities come into play. Refusing all contact could be seen as selfish. The ex-wife is trying to facilitate contact, which the child might be interested in. The author's refusal might be based on personal preferences without considering the child's needs.\n\nHowever, there are cases where a parent's absence is due to personal choice, and if there's no abuse or neglect, it's a personal decision. But in many legal systems, both parents have rights unless there's a court order limiting contact. If there's no such order, the author might be violating the child's right to know their parent.\n\nSo legally, the author might be in the wrong if there's no court-approved reason for non-contact. Ethically, it's questionable because the child's well-being is important. The author's answer is B (not in the wrong), but the analysis shows potential issues both legally and ethically, leaning towards A.\n"
