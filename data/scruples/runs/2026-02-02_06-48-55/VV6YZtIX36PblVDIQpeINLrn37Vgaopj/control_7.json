I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who didn't want children, caused a pregnancy, and after a breakup, has been paying child support but had no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the child, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, which he's fulfilling by not missing payments. But parental rights and responsibilities vary. If he's a legal parent, there might be laws requiring some level of involvement, even if it's minimal. However, if he's not the legal parent or if he waived parental rights, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention legal termination of parental rights, so he might still have them.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father didn't want children but became a parent. He's providing financially but not emotionally. The mother is trying to connect him with the child. The question is whether he's morally obligated to have a relationship with his child. Some might argue that even if you don't want children, you have a responsibility to your child's life. Others might say his right to personal choice is important, especially if he's not in the child's daily life.\n\nCultural and societal norms also play a role. In some cultures, fathers are expected to be involved regardless of their initial wishes. In others, personal freedom is emphasized. The mother's actions\u2014arranging a meeting\u2014could be seen as trying to give the child a relationship with her father, which is often considered beneficial for the child's well-being.\n\nThe father's lack of contact might affect the child's emotional development. The mother might be acting in the child's best interest. However, the father's stance could be due to personal convictions. But if he's a legal parent, avoiding contact entirely could be problematic, especially if the child has a right to know their father.\n\nI should also check if there are any legal obligations regarding contact. In some jurisdictions, non-custodial parents are encouraged to have contact unless it's detrimental to the child. If he's been avoiding contact, there might be legal steps the mother could take. But since the father hasn't been contacted beyond child support, maybe there's no legal requirement for contact yet.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. While he's fulfilling financial duties, emotional and relational aspects are also part of parenthood. The child might benefit from a relationship, even if the father didn't plan for it. But the father's autonomy is a factor too. However, once a child is born, the parent's rights and responsibilities are significant. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not engaging, even if he didn't want children initially.\n\nBut then again, if he's a legal parent, he has the right to refuse contact. However, in many cases, the child's best interest is the priority. So if the mother is trying to facilitate a relationship for the child's sake, the father's refusal could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. But it's a balance between the father's rights and the child's needs.\n\nI think the answer leans towards Yes (A), because even though he's paying child support, parental responsibility includes more than just financial support. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason to restrict contact. His complete avoidance might be considered neglecting that part of his responsibility.\n"
