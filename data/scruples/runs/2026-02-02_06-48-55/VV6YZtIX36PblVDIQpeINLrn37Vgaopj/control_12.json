I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They split up after four months, he agreed to child support and hasn't missed a payment. He's had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have a right to have a relationship with their child unless there's a court order restricting contact. If he's been paying child support but hasn't had contact, there might be a legal expectation for some level of involvement. However, since he's been paying support without any contact, maybe there's a prior agreement or court order that's allowing this. But if the ex is trying to involve him now, he might be legally obligated unless there's a specific reason to block it, like if he's a danger to the child.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father didn't want the child, but he contributed to the pregnancy. Some might argue that he has a responsibility to be involved in the child's life, even if he didn't plan for it. On the other hand, if he's been consistent in not wanting to be involved and hasn't missed support payments, others might say he's fulfilling his financial obligation and that the mother should have the final say in how the child is raised. But the child has the right to know their father, so denying contact could be seen as harmful to the child's well-being.\n\nThe user is asking for A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Considering both legal and ethical angles, there's a possibility he's in the wrong because the child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason to prevent it. However, if there was a court agreement that allows him to not have contact, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the key here is that he's now refusing to even consider contact, which might be against the child's best interests. So legally and ethically, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
