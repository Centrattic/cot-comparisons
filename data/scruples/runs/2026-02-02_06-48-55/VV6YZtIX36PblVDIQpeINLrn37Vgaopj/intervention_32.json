I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that he impregnated his ex-girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet their child, and he refuses. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have a legal right to have a relationship with their child unless they've been deemed unfit. Since he's paying child support and hasn't missed payments, maybe he's fulfilling his legal obligations. But legally, he might still have rights to custody or visitation unless there's a court order blocking contact. But the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal.\n\nMoral aspect: The father never wanted children, but once the child was born, does that change his responsibility? Some might argue that while he didn't want to be a father, he's responsible for the child's well-being. Others might say that if he never intended to be a parent and has no contact, it's his right to disengage. However, completely cutting off contact could be seen as selfish or neglectful. The child has a right to know their father, even if he didn't want to be involved.\n\nEmotional impact on the child: As the child grows, not having a relationship with the father might affect her development. The mother might also be trying to establish a relationship for the child's benefit. The father's refusal could be seen as disregarding the child's needs. On the other hand, if he's not emotionally ready or capable, maybe it's better for the child not to have a strained relationship.\n\nThe father's perspective is that he never wanted children and has maintained financial responsibility. But emotionally, not engaging might be seen as abdicating his parental role. There's a balance between personal choice and parental duty. Even if he didn't want to be a father, once the child exists, some might argue he has a moral obligation to be involved, at least to some extent.\n\nThe fact that he sends a birthday gift anonymously shows at least some acknowledgment of the child's existence, but not a relationship. The key point is whether he's choosing to remain disengaged despite the child's existence. If the ex wants to introduce the child to him, his refusal might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's interests.\n\nIn many cultures, parental rights include both financial and emotional responsibilities. By not wanting any part in the child's life, he's fulfilling the financial part but not the emotional. This could be considered morally wrong because the child is entitled to both. However, it's also possible that he's not in the wrong if he believes he can't provide a positive impact and that not having a relationship is better for the child. But that's a bit of a stretch.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he's choosing not to engage in any meaningful way with his child beyond financial support. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, and his refusal to consider meeting could be seen as selfish. But there's also the argument that if he's not capable of being a parent, maybe it's better for the child to have no contact. However, that's a more nuanced view and depends on the child's best interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be considered in the wrong because they neglect the emotional aspects of parenthood beyond just financial support.\n"
