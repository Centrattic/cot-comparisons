I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who impregnated his then-girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion which she refused, and then they broke up after four months. Since then, he's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift via the mother. Now, the ex wants him to meet their daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have a right to have a relationship with their child unless there are reasons to restrict it, like abuse or neglect. The father here has been paying support but has cut off contact. There might be a legal obligation for visitation unless there's a court order restricting it. Since he hasn't had contact, maybe the mother is the one facilitating that, but he's refusing now when the ex is trying to arrange a meeting.\n\nEthically, being a parent often involves more than just financial support. The child has the right to know their parent, and the father's complete lack of involvement beyond money could be seen as neglectful. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child is born, he has a responsibility. The fact that he sent a gift anonymously might suggest he's aware but chooses not to engage.\n\nHowever, the father's perspective is that he never wanted children and is not interested in a relationship. He might have his reasons, but from a societal standpoint, cutting off all contact could be considered wrong. The answer depends on balancing the father's right to privacy and his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nIn many legal systems, the child's best interest is paramount. The father's refusal to meet could be seen as not acting in the child's best interest. The mother might have a role here too, if she's been blocking contact, but the father is rejecting the opportunity now. So the author's answer would likely be A (he is in the wrong) because despite paying support, he's avoiding any parental involvement beyond financial obligations.\n"
