I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nFirst, they got their girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. They didn't want kids, so they offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after that and then broke up. The person has been paying child support as ordered by the courts and never missed a payment. However, they've had no contact with their daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now, the ex wants them to meet the daughter, but the person refuses and doesn't want any contact.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities towards their children. Even if the parent isn't the one initiating contact, they might be expected to have some relationship. The person is paying child support, which covers financial responsibilities, but emotional and parental involvement is another aspect. If the parent is withholding contact without a valid reason, the other parent might take them to court to enforce visitation rights. So legally, depending on the jurisdiction, the author might be violating court orders if there's a requirement for contact.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The person claims they never wanted children and have no interest in the child's life. However, the child has the right to know their parent, even if the parent isn't involved. Denying that relationship could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is old enough to be curious. But the parent's autonomy and lack of desire to be involved also play a role here.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. Courts typically prioritize the child's well-being, which includes having a relationship with both parents unless it's harmful. If the parent's absence is not harmful, maybe it's acceptable. But if the parent is avoiding all contact despite the child wanting to know them, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions sending a birthday gift. That shows some level of awareness, but it's minimal. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting now, which the author is resisting. The author's refusal could be seen as neglecting their parental duties beyond financial support.\n\nIn some cases, even if a parent doesn't want a close relationship, maintaining some contact is considered necessary. The author's complete disinterest might not be in the child's best interest. Plus, if the child is asking about the parent, denying that contact could cause emotional distress.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they never consented to parenthood and that their lack of involvement is a personal choice. But legally and ethically, once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities that extend beyond finances. So, the author's stance might not hold up in court or in terms of moral obligation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong both legally (if required by court order to have contact) and ethically (for denying the child a relationship with their parent). Unless there are extenuating circumstances like abuse or harm, which aren't mentioned here, the author's refusal to engage could be seen as wrong.\n"
