I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who doesn't want to be involved in his child's life. He impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she went through with the pregnancy. They split after four months, he pays child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a parent can't completely disown a child, especially if there's a court order for support. But he's paying support, which he hasn't missed. However, custody and visitation rights might come into play. If the mother is trying to arrange contact, there might be a legal obligation to participate.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The father chose to have the child but later didn't want it. He's providing financially but not emotionally. Some might argue that a child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want them. Others might say that if he didn't want to be a parent, he shouldn't have contributed to the pregnancy. But he did father the child, so there's a responsibility.\n\nThe answer depends on context. Legally, maybe he's not wrong if child support is covered. Ethically, many might say he's in the wrong for denying the child a relationship. The court might have given the mother custody, but the father's refusal to engage could be seen as neglectful. However, the mother's desire to involve the father could be the child's right, so the father's stance might be considered wrong.\n"
