I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't want kids, impregnated his girlfriend, she wanted to keep the baby, they broke up, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet his daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, so he's fulfilling that part. But in many places, there are laws about parental rights and child custody. Even if the parent isn't the custodial one, they usually have the right to have a relationship with their child unless there's a court order restricting that. The author hasn't been involved, which might be a legal gray area. If there was a custody arrangement, maybe he's supposed to have some contact. If not, maybe he's not in the wrong legally, but ethically?\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The child has a right to know both parents, especially if the father is financially supporting them. The author sends a birthday gift, which shows some involvement, but it's very minimal. Refusing to meet the daughter might be seen as avoiding responsibility, even if he's not the custodial parent. However, the author clearly states he didn't want children, which complicates things. He might feel he's doing his part with money, but emotionally and socially, the child could miss out on a father figure.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if there's no court order requiring him to have contact beyond child support, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the ex is trying to arrange contact and he's refusing without a court's say, maybe he's not fulfilling what's in the child's best interest. Different cultures and legal systems might view this differently. In some places, fathers are expected to have a relationship if the child wants it. In others, it's more about the mother's decision if there's no court order.\n\nAlso, the author's stance is that he doesn't want to be involved. Even if he's not legally in the wrong, socially or morally, people might judge him harshly. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format often leans towards considering the child's well-being and societal expectations. The answer might depend on whether there's a legal requirement for contact. Since the author hasn't missed child support and it's been settled through the courts, maybe the courts didn't mandate contact. Without that, he might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's debatable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if he's being judged harshly. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong, if there's no legal obligation beyond child support. But if there's an implied ethical obligation, then A. But the user is asking for a yes or no based on the scenario given. Since the courts didn't order contact, and he's paying support, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the ex is trying to arrange contact and he's refusing without a valid reason, some might say he is. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The key is whether there's a legal requirement. If there isn't, then he's not in the wrong. If there is, then he is. The scenario says the child support was settled through the courts, but no mention of contact. So probably B.\n"
