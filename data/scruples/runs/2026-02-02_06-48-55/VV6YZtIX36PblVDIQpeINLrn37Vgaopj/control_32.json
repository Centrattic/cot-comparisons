I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't want kids, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months, and the author has been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about parental rights and responsibilities. Even though the author didn't want the child, once a child is born, legal obligations kick in. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities, not just financial but also potential visitation rights depending on the jurisdiction. However, the author hasn't been involved beyond child support. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, and the author is refusing. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if he's the legal father, he might have some rights, but if he's never been involved, maybe the court would consider his lack of presence. But the issue is more about moral or ethical responsibility. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want to be involved. \n\nBut the author's stance is that he never wanted the child and has no interest. However, some might argue that by being the father, he's responsible for more than just money. There's also the child's well-being to consider. Refusing to have any relationship could be seen as selfish or neglectful. On the other hand, if he wasn't involved from the start, maybe it's not fair to force him into a relationship he didn't want. \n\nI think there's a middle ground here. Legally, maybe he's not required to have contact if he's not been involved, but ethically, some might say he should try to build a relationship. The answer might depend on cultural attitudes too. In many places, there's an expectation that fathers should be involved, even if they didn't plan for it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's refusal could be seen as being in the wrong because he's denying his child a relationship with their father. But others might argue that he's not obligated to be involved if he never wanted to be. However, since he's paying child support, that's a form of responsibility, but maybe not enough. The line between financial support and emotional/parental involvement is blurry here. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because having a child involves more than just money, and denying the child a father figure could be harmful. Even if he didn't want the child initially, he's part of their life now, and the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. So the author might be in the wrong for refusing to engage beyond financial support.\n"
