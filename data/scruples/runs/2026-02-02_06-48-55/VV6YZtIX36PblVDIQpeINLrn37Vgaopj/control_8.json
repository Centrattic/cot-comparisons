I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author impregnated his girlfriend 7 years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted the child. They stayed together 4 months, then broke up. He's paid child support consistently and had no contact with the daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. The ex wants him to meet the kid, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be involved. Legally, he's meeting his obligations with child support, so that's covered. But morally? Well, children have a right to know their parents, right? But the author doesn't want to be part of her life. There's a conflict between his personal wishes and the child's potential rights.\n\nIn many places, parents have a legal duty to maintain a relationship with their child, not just financial. If a parent unilaterally decides to cut off contact without a good reason, that might be considered neglect. But the author is paying support, so maybe legally he's compliant. However, ethically, is he in the wrong? Some might say yes because the child deserves a relationship with both parents. Others might say it's his choice since he didn't want kids from the start.\n\nBut the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, indicating the mother wants the child to know the father. If the author refuses, could that affect the child's well-being? Maybe the court would step in if the mother pursued it, but the author is avoiding contact. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or legal standards. In some contexts, the father's right to refuse might be respected, but in others, the child's right to a relationship might override that. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong morally because he's denying the child a relationship with their father, which can have long-term effects. Legally, maybe he's okay, but ethically, no. So answer A.\n"
