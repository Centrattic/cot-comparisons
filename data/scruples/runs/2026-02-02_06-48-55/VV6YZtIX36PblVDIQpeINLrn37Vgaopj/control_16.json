I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a child they had with an ex-partner, and the key points are:\n\n1. The person didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but the girlfriend wanted the child. They stayed together for 4 months post-pregnancy before breaking up. They've been paying child support consistently.\n\n2. The author has had no contact with their daughter since, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses and asks the ex not to contact them again about it.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, parental rights don't automatically terminate just because someone didn't want children. Even if the parent didn't want the child initially, once born, they have legal obligations and rights. However, the author has been paying child support, which is a positive point. But if they have no contact, that might affect custody or visitation rights. Depending on the laws, the non-custodial parent might have the right to have contact with the child unless a court orders otherwise. If the author is blocking all communication, that could be problematic legally.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The author didn't want a child and hasn't engaged with their daughter's life. Now the ex wants the child to know her father, but the author is resistant. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that the child has a right to know their father, especially if the father is financially supporting them. However, others might say that the author has a right to privacy and not to be forced into a relationship they don't want.\n\nThe ex's perspective is also important. If the child is asking about the father, the ex might feel it's in the child's best interest to meet him. But the author's stance is firm in not wanting any part in the child's life. The author's actions could potentially affect the child's well-being, but they are fulfilling their financial responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of legal wrong, if the author is blocking contact without a court order, they could be in violation of custody or visitation agreements. If there's no court-ordered contact, maybe they aren't legally in the wrong. But ethically, the question is whether they should have a relationship with the child. \n\nThe author mentions they don't want contact. If the ex is trying to facilitate contact against the author's wishes, that could be a conflict. However, the author's refusal to engage might be seen as neglecting their parental role, even if they don't want to be a parent. \n\nIn some places, the court might require the non-custodial parent to have some contact if it's in the child's best interest. Since the author is not engaging, they might be in the wrong if they are denying the child a relationship with their parent. However, if there was no court order for contact, it's more about the author's choice. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because, while they are fulfilling financial obligations, they are denying the child a relationship with the other parent. But if there's no legal requirement, maybe B (not in the wrong). However, ethics often suggest that a child has a right to know both parents, so the author's refusal could be seen as unethical. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong, which could be a mix of legal and ethical considerations. Given that the author is avoiding contact despite the child's existence, the ethical stance is more likely to side with A. But legally, unless a court order is in place, it's unclear. However, in many cases, a parent cannot unilaterally cut off contact unless there are valid reasons like abuse. Since there's no mention of such issues, the author's refusal might be considered in the wrong both legally and ethically.\n"
