I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who doesn't want any part in his child's life. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together four months, then split up. He's been paying child support on time through the courts. No contact with the daughter, only occasional birthday gifts sent via the ex. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he's been paying child support, so he's fulfilling his financial obligations. But what about his parental responsibilities? In many places, parents have a legal duty to maintain a relationship with their child unless there's a court order limiting contact. If he's not providing care or any emotional support, that could be an issue. But he's been avoiding contact entirely except for the gifts. \n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want kids. The fact that he's been completely absent might be seen as neglectful. But he did take responsibility by paying child support. Maybe some people would argue that his financial support isn't enough, especially considering the child's emotional needs. On the other hand, he wasn't consulted about the pregnancy and initially didn't want the child. However, once a child is born, parental responsibilities typically kick in regardless of intentions.\n\nThe ex's attempt to arrange a meeting might be in the child's best interest. If the father refuses contact, does that harm the child? That's a key point. Also, the mother might have a say in contact, but the father's refusal could be legally challenged if there's no court order preventing it. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, maybe not, if there's no court order requiring contact. But ethically, many might say yes because he's denying the child a relationship with a parent. However, if he's a non-custodial parent and the court hasn't mandated contact, his stance might be considered his right. But if he's blocking all contact without legal justification, that could be problematic. \n\nI think the answer depends on legal context, but since the user is asking for a general opinion, the ethical angle is stronger. Denying a child a relationship with a parent (even if the parent didn't want it) can be seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong). But there's nuance here. Some might argue it's his right to not be a part of the child's life. However, the child's right to know their parent could outweigh that. So, leaning towards A.\n"
