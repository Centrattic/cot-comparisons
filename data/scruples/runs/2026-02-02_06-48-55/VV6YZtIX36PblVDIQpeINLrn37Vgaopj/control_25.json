I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion, she wanted the baby, they broke up after four months. He's been paying child support consistently but has had no contact with his daughter beyond sending a birthday gift through the ex. Now the ex wants to arrange a meeting, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the father might have rights to see the child. However, if there's a court order that established child support without custody rights, maybe the father doesn't have the right to object to contact. But if the mother is trying to facilitate contact and the father is blocking it, that might be an issue.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father didn't want the child but took responsibility by paying support. However, the child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want to be a parent. The author's refusal to have any contact could be seen as neglecting the child's needs for a relationship. On the other hand, the father might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved, like not wanting to be a parent.\n\nThere's also the question of the child's best interest. Courts usually prioritize the child's well-being, which includes having a relationship with both parents unless there are legitimate concerns. The father's actions could be seen as hindering the child's ability to form a relationship. However, since he's been paying support, he's fulfilling part of his duty.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's role. If she's trying to arrange the meeting, she might be acting in the child's interest. The father's refusal could be seen as obstructive. However, if the mother is the one initiating, maybe the father has a right to decline if he's not prepared to be involved.\n\nLegally, depending on jurisdiction, the father might need to have custody or visitation rights to refuse the contact. If there's no court-ordered custody arrangement, the mother might have sole custody, and the father's refusal might not be legally actionable, but ethically, it's questionable.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might argue that the father is fulfilling his financial responsibility but neglecting his parental responsibilities. Others might say that he made a choice not to be a parent, and it's not his fault the mother wanted the child.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on legal rights and ethical obligations. Legally, maybe the father isn't in the wrong if there's no custody order forcing contact. Ethically, there's a strong case that he is in the wrong for not engaging with his child beyond financial support. The child's right to a relationship with the father is a key ethical consideration.\n"
