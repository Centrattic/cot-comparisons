I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered an abortion but she chose to have the child. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the child, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically forfeited just because someone didn't want the child. Even if he wasn't involved, he has a legal responsibility, but does he have a legal right to limit contact? Since he's paying child support, maybe there's a legal expectation for some level of involvement. However, if the mother has sole custody, he might not be legally compelled to have contact. But the question is about moral or social wrong, not just legal.\n\nMorally, there's a debate. The father chose to take responsibility financially, which is important, but emotional and relational responsibility is another aspect. Some might argue that a child benefits from knowing both parents, regardless of the father's initial wishes. Others might say that if he never wanted the child and made that clear, he can't be forced to have a relationship. The issue is consent\u2014did he have a say in becoming a parent, and does he have a right to opt out of a relationship? \n\nThe father's actions have consequences. The child exists because of his actions, so some might argue there's a moral duty to be involved, even if it's not forced. However, others might say that he's fulfilling his financial duty and has the right to choose not to be involved further. \n\nThere's also the child's interest. Children often have a right to know about their heritage and have a relationship with both parents if possible. If the mother is pushing for contact, maybe the child wants that, which complicates things. The father's refusal might be seen as selfish, but if he's genuinely uninterested and not being abusive, it's a personal choice.\n\nThe key points are: He's paying support, no contact, now the mother wants him involved. Legally, he might not be in the wrong if he's fulfilling his obligations. Morally, it's more ambiguous. Some people might side with him because he didn't want the child and is not being abusive, just uninvolved. Others might think that once a child exists, a parent has a duty to be part of their life if the child wants it. \n\nThe answer hinges on societal expectations of parental responsibility. If the community values parental involvement beyond financial support, then he's in the wrong. If the focus is on his right to disengage after taking financial responsibility, then not. Given the scenario, the author's refusal to meet the child despite financial support could be seen as in the wrong because it denies the child a relationship with the father, which some might argue is unjust. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
