About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author got his girlfriend pregnant seven years ago. He didn't want children and offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to have the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was confirmed and then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. However, he has had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift once. Now, his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nSo the main question is whether not wanting any contact with his child makes him in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's fulfilling his financial responsibilities, which is his legal obligation. But legally, does that cover all his duties? Or is there a moral or ethical component to being a parent beyond just money?\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, child support is the main requirement once the parent's responsibilities are established. But there's also the aspect of visitation rights. However, in this case, the author hasn't been involved, so maybe the mother has sole custody. But the key point here is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting any contact.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. The author didn't want children, and the mother chose to have the child despite his wishes. He's not the one advocating for the child's rights, but he's providing financial support. The child was born as a result of a relationship, and now the mother wants to introduce the child to the father. The author is refusing, possibly out of a desire to avoid responsibility or because he genuinely doesn't want to be involved.\n\nBut from a moral perspective, some people would argue that a parent has a responsibility to be involved in their child's life, not just financially. However, others might say that if the parent didn't want the child in the first place and the mother chose to have the child against his wishes, he isn't legally forced to have contact and might have the right to disengage. However, the child has a right to know their father, according to some viewpoints.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as selfish if he's avoiding any responsibility beyond money, but if he's been consistent in his decision since the beginning, maybe he's not the problem. The mother might be trying to push for more involvement now, but the author's stance is clear.\n\nI need to consider both legal and moral angles. Legally, he's meeting the requirements. Morally, there's a debate. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, the question is asking whether the author is in the wrong, not just legal vs moral. Since the user is likely looking for a judgment based on common moral standards, there might be arguments on both sides.\n\nBut given that he's providing support and not forcing himself on the mother or child, some might say he's not in the wrong. Others might argue that he should want to be involved. The key here is that he's not the one opposing the child's existence; the mother made the choice. However, the child's right to know their father is another angle. The answer isn't straightforward, but given the context, the author's answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's fulfilling his legal obligations and choosing to disengage while being consistent in his stance.\n"
