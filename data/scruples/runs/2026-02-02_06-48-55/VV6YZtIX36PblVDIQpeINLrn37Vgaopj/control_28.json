I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact with the child. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have a right and responsibility to have a relationship with their child unless there's a court order restricting that. But since he's been paying child support and hasn't been involved, there might be legal implications if the ex seeks custody or visitation. However, the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The father didn't want the child, but he's been financially responsible. However, not having any contact with the child is a point of contention. Some might argue that a parent has a duty to be involved, regardless of their initial wishes. Others might say that if the father clearly communicated his lack of desire to be a parent and the mother took on the role, then he isn't in the wrong. But cutting the child off completely could be seen as neglectful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he never wanted children, and he's been paying support. However, completely avoiding any contact might be considered selfish or inconsiderate. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father didn't want to be a parent. The fact that he sends a birthday gift anonymously but doesn't want to meet could be seen as a halfway measure but not enough.\n\nThe ex's initiative to arrange a meeting might be for the child's benefit, so the father's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the child's well-being. On the other hand, if the father is truly not interested and the mother is capable of providing a good life, his stance might be justified. But the lack of any relationship could be harmful in the long run for the child.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The father didn't want the child, but once born, the child exists. The ethical debate here is about the father's responsibility post-birth. Some might say that even if you don't want to be a parent, you should at least maintain a relationship. Others might say it's their right to disengage if they made their stance clear.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, most people might expect some level of involvement, even if it's minimal. So the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) for refusing to have any part in the child's life beyond financial support. However, there's the counterargument that he made his intentions clear and the mother chose to proceed, so he's not in the wrong (B). But the complete absence of contact might tip the balance towards being in the wrong.\n"
