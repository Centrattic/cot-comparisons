I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't want kids, offered an abortion but the girlfriend wanted the child. They broke up, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact except for birthdays. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities. Even if the child wasn't his intention, he's the legal father. So having contact might be legally required, but he's paying support, which he's done. But legally, he might have to be involved to some extent. If the ex is trying to arrange contact unilaterally, maybe there's a legal obligation here.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The child has a right to know their father, even if the author doesn't want to be involved. But the author's not the one who wanted the child; the ex made the choice to have it. However, once the child exists, both parents have responsibilities. The author might feel he's fulfilled his obligation by paying support, but some might argue that being present in the child's life is also part of parenthood.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as neglectful. By not having any contact, even minimal, he's not providing a relationship. The fact that he sends a gift anonymously is a small gesture, but not much else. The ex might feel it's in the child's best interest to have a relationship with the father, which the author is denying.\n\nAnother point: the author's refusal to engage might be impacting the child's life. Children often benefit from having both parents involved, even if the parents aren't together. If the author is avoiding all contact, that could be harmful. But he might have his reasons, like personal beliefs or past conflicts with the ex, which could complicate things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if he didn't want the child initially, once the child is born, he's responsible. The author's stance might be legally justified in some areas, but ethically, it's questionable. Some might say it's wrong to deny the child a relationship with the father, while others might respect his right to choose not to be involved.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, parental involvement is expected, while in others, people might be more understanding of a father's choice. But generally, the idea is that both parents should be involved unless it's not in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong ethically for not engaging with his daughter, even if he's meeting the financial part of his obligations. The answer might be A for Yes, he's in the wrong. But I need to check if there are any nuances I'm missing, like if the child's well-being is being adequately addressed without him. If the ex is a good parent and the child is thriving, maybe the author's not the worst, but still, the lack of contact could be seen as neglectful.\n"
