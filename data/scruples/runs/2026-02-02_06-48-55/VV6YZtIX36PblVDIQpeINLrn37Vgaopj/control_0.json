I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want children and offered an abortion when his girlfriend got pregnant. She wanted to have the child, they stayed together briefly, then broke up. He's been paying child support but has had no contact otherwise. Now his ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, child support obligations are clear, but the right to have contact with a child might be more complex. The father might have legal rights here, but if he hasn't been involved, the court might not enforce visitation. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nMoral-wise, some might argue that a parent has a responsibility to be part of their child's life. The father is providing financially but not emotionally. Others might say he was clear from the start about not wanting children and shouldn't be forced to engage. The child's well-being is a factor. The daughter might benefit from knowing her father, but the father's lack of interest could be harmful. However, if the father is not being pushed to interact and is fulfilling financial duties, some might see that as sufficient.\n\nAlso, the father's past actions: he didn't pressure for abortion, supported financially, but no contact. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting now. The father's refusal might be seen as selfish, but if he's not been involved, maybe the ex shouldn't be pushing him. It's a tricky situation. The answer could hinge on cultural values and personal ethics regarding parental responsibility versus autonomy.\n"
