I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a child with their ex-girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They split up after four months, and the author has been paying child support but has no contact with the child. Now the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but the author refuses. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities towards their children. Even if the author didn't want the child, once born, they might have a legal obligation to be involved, especially if the ex is trying to arrange contact. But the author has been paying child support on time, which is a key part of their responsibility. However, visitation rights might come into play. If the court has set up something about contact, the author might be violating that by refusing. But the story mentions they settled through the courts for child support, not necessarily visitation. So maybe there's no court order for contact.\n\nEthically, it's more subjective. The author might feel they never wanted a child and aren't a good fit, but the child has a right to know their father. The ex is trying to facilitate that, but the author is resistant. There's a conflict between the father's right to refuse and the child's right to a relationship. \n\nIn some cultures, parental rights are strong, but if there's a history of non-contact, the court might require some involvement. However, the author hasn't been involved beyond financial support. The question is whether refusing contact is in the child's best interest. If the ex is the primary caregiver, maybe she's trying to include the father for the child's sake. But the author's reasoning is that they don't want to be part of the child's life. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as neglecting a parental duty, even if they're financially responsible. There's a difference between supporting and being involved. Legally, it might depend on the specific laws in their jurisdiction. Some places require both financial and emotional support. If the author's refusal to meet could be deemed harmful to the child, they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut if there's no legal requirement for contact, then it's a personal choice. However, the fact that the ex is reaching out might indicate that the child wants to know them. The author's refusal could be denying the child a relationship with their father. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author has a legal duty to be involved, which they might not, but ethically, they might be in the wrong for not considering the child's needs. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) if legally or ethically obligated, or B (no) if it's their right to refuse. In many cases, while financial support is mandatory, contact isn't unless ordered by the court. So if there's no court order, the author isn't in the wrong. But there's an ethical debate. However, the question is phrased as a general morality question, not strictly legal. So maybe the ethical side tips towards A. But I'm not sure. I need to check common Reddit threads on similar topics. In AITA posts, often people are told that parents have a duty to be involved. So the answer might be A. But I'm conflicted.\n"
