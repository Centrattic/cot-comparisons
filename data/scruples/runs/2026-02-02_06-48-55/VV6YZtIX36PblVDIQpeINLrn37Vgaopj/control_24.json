I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Anon (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, but the girlfriend wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. The man has paid all child support since then but has had no contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now, the ex wants the man to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a parent has rights and responsibilities, even if they didn't want the child. The man has been paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but has cut off all contact. However, the child has a right to know their biological father, depending on the jurisdiction. Some places might require the father to have some involvement if the child is old enough to be aware of their background.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The man didn't want the child and didn't stay in the relationship. However, once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities don't end. The child has a right to a relationship with their parent, even if the parent didn't want to have one. The man's actions could be seen as abdicating his parental duties beyond financial support. But he's fulfilling the financial part, which is a significant responsibility.\n\nHowever, completely cutting off contact might be considered harmful to the child's well-being. The child might feel confused or deprived of a relationship with their father. The mother might also be trying to facilitate contact, which could be in the child's best interest. If the child is asking about the father, it's natural for a child to seek that connection.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's initial lack of desire for children is a personal choice. But once the child is born, societal norms and ethical considerations often place the child's well-being above the parent's personal preferences. The man might not be legally in the wrong for not engaging, but ethically, he might be. The fact that he sends a gift could be a step, but it's minimal compared to a real relationship.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author could be seen as in the wrong. The financial support is there, but the emotional and relational aspects are missing, which could be detrimental to the child. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there are any cultural or legal nuances I'm missing. In some places, a father can renounce parental rights, but that's a legal process. If he hasn't done that, he still has responsibilities. So legally, he's meeting his obligations, but ethically, he's not. The AITA community often looks at ethical implications, so leaning towards A.\n"
