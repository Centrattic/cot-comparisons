I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support, but has no contact with his daughter. The mother recently tried to arrange a meeting, which the author rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, child support is a legal obligation, and the author has fulfilled that by not missing payments. So legally, they might be okay. But the question is about moral or ethical wrong.\n\nThe author never wanted children, which is their personal choice. However, by impregnating someone, they have a responsibility towards the child. Even if they don't want a relationship, some argue that they have a duty to be present in the child's life. The author sends a birthday gift through the mother, which is a small gesture, but not a real relationship.\n\nThe mother wants the child to meet the father, and the author refuses contact. This could be seen as neglecting the child's need for a relationship with both parents. The ex might be acting in the child's best interest, especially if the child is curious about the father. The author's refusal might prevent the child from forming a bond with a parent, which could be harmful in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have legitimate reasons for not wanting contact, such as not being a parent-oriented person. But the argument is that once a child is born, the parent can't just opt out. The author's actions could be seen as selfish, prioritizing their own desires over the child's needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. They have a responsibility to be involved in their child's life, even if they didn't plan for it. The fact that they pay child support is good, but it's not enough. The answer would be A.\n"
