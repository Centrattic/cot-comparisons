I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user is a man who had a child with his ex-girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want children and initially offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was confirmed and then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently through the courts and hasn't had any contact with his daughter. The only interaction he's had is sending a birthday gift through the mother. Recently, his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's refused, not interested, and asked not to be contacted about it again. He's unsure if the child or the ex initiated the request.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate based on typical social norms, legal obligations, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, legally, he's fulfilling his responsibility by paying child support, which is a key obligation. But in many places, there are also rights regarding visitation or contact with the child. However, since he hasn't been in contact before, maybe he didn't establish any visitation rights or maybe the court didn't enforce it. But even so, the ex might have the right to arrange such meetings, especially if the child is reaching an age where knowing the father is desired.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The author never wanted the child and has chosen to remain completely absent from the daughter's life. While he's financially supporting her, emotional and parental involvement is another aspect. The daughter might benefit from a relationship with the father, especially as she grows older. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as dismissive of the child's needs, even if the mother is the one pushing for it. The author's stance is that he's not interested, which could be seen as a lack of responsibility beyond financial support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved. The situation started with an unwanted pregnancy, and maybe he feels disconnected. However, once a child is born, the legal and moral obligations extend beyond just financial support. The child has a right to know both parents, assuming it's in their best interest. The author's complete disengagement might be harmful to the child's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: If the ex is pushing for contact, maybe the child is asking about the father, which is a common development as children grow older. The father's refusal could hinder the child from having a relationship with him, which is a part of her identity. The author's position is strictly about not wanting to be involved, which might be seen as selfish if the child's well-being is a consideration.\n\nIn some cases, people may choose to disengage from parenthood, but society often expects a certain level of involvement. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by refusing contact when the child might want it. Legally, he's upholding his duty, but ethically, there could be a different perspective. The answer might depend on cultural norms and individual perspectives. However, the general consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because a parent's role isn't just financial but also emotional and relational, especially as the child grows. So the answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong."
