I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts.

The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person (the father in this situation) is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting any part in his child's life.\n\nFirst, the background: He impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy, then broke up. He started paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. He hasn't had any contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Recently, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refused.\n\nSo, from what I understand, he's fulfilling the legal obligation (child support) but is avoiding any emotional or personal connection. The key issue here is whether not having a relationship with the child makes him wrong.\n\nIn many places, fathers have legal rights and responsibilities. Even if he's paying child support, there's often an expectation (especially in non-custodial situations) that the parent maintains some level of contact for the child's well-being. However, the details here are that he's been completely absent, only sending a gift once. The ex is now trying to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, a non-custodial parent can refuse visitation if it's not court-ordered. If the court hasn't mandated visitation, he might not be legally obligated to have contact. However, ethically or morally, there's a debate. Children often benefit from having a relationship with both parents, and blocking contact entirely could be seen as selfish or neglectful.\n\nBut the father's stance is that he never wanted children and isn't interested. That's a personal choice, but when a child is involved, the situation becomes more complex. The mother might have a right to facilitate contact if the child is old enough to desire a relationship. However, the father's refusal could be his right if there's no court order. Still, some might argue that even if not legally required, it's in the child's best interest to have that connection.\n\nThe key points are: legal obligations vs. moral responsibilities. If there's no court-mandated visitation, he might not be in the wrong legally. But morally, it's debatable. The user is asking if he's \"in the wrong,\" which is a bit ambiguous. If it's about legal wrong, then maybe not. If it's about moral or social wrong, then possibly yes. The answer might depend on the legal system in the area, but since the question is general, it's probably leaning towards a moral/ethical judgment.\n\nIn many discussions, people would say he's being selfish. Even if he doesn't want to be a parent, the child has a right to know the father. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) from a moral standpoint. But if it's strictly legal, maybe B. Since the question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), it's more about social/moral judgment. So the answer would likely be A.\n"
