About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want children and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was decided and then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and hasn't missed a payment. He has had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift via the mother with specific instructions. Now, the ex wants the author to meet the daughter, but he refuses and tells her not to contact him again. He's unsure if the daughter initiated the contact or the ex.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: The author is fulfilling his legal obligation by paying child support. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. But the question is about moral or ethical wrong.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The author was a parent when the child was born, even if he didn't want it. He has a biological child who is growing up without a father. The author is choosing not to have any part in the child's life. Is that ethical? Some might argue that every child deserves both parents' presence, if possible. But others might say that if the parent is not willing to be involved, it's not their fault, especially if they are fulfilling financial responsibilities.\n\nThe author has been absent from the child's life. He sent a gift once, but that's it. When approached to meet, he refuses. The ex wants the child to meet him, but he doesn't want that. The author doesn't know if the daughter is curious about him or if the ex is pushing for it. That uncertainty complicates things.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: He is the child's father and is choosing to be absent, which could harm the child's emotional well-being. The child might grow up feeling a sense of loss or confusion. Also, some might argue that even if he didn't want the child, he's responsible for the child's upbringing in some form, not just financially.\n\nArguments against the author being in the wrong: He has fulfilled his financial duties. He didn't want children initially, and the mother chose to have the child. His non-involvement might be his personal choice, and he's not forcing the mother to contact him. The mother is the one who is raising the child, so she might be the one responsible for the child's upbringing.\n\nBut then, even if he's not obligated to be involved, some people believe that as a biological parent, you have a moral obligation to be part of your child's life. The author is choosing to be completely absent, which could be seen as selfish. Especially if the child is reaching out or the mother wants to connect, the author's refusal could be seen as not taking responsibility.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the ex contacting him. The author is cutting off the ex from discussing the matter, which might prevent any reconciliation or the child from knowing her father. However, the author might feel that getting involved could complicate things, especially if the mother is trying to create a positive image of him or if there's a history of conflict.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be laws about a parent's right to have contact with their child, but since the author hasn't been involved, there might be barriers to sudden contact. The mother has custody, and the author might not have standing to object if the mother wants him to be involved. But again, the author might feel that getting involved now could be disruptive.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is legally in compliance but ethically, there's a debate. If the child is now asking about him, his refusal to meet could be seen as not supporting the child's need to know her father. However, if he's truly not interested and has been absent for years, some might argue it's his right to make that choice, even if it's selfish.\n\nI think the answer hinges on societal expectations versus personal choice. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, and I can see that reasoning. So, I'd lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to be absent despite his child's existence, which could have negative impacts on the child's well-being. But there's also an argument that he's not in the wrong because it's his choice and he's fulfilling financial obligations. However, the common sentiment in such situations often leans towards the parent having a moral responsibility beyond just financial support.\n"
