I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts.

About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support through the courts and hasn't had any contact with his daughter. He sent birthday gifts through the mother but with instructions not to say they're from him. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the author has been paying child support, so he's fulfilling his financial obligations. But legally, he might still have a right to contact the child, but he's choosing not to. However, in many jurisdictions, both parents have rights to their child unless terminated by court order. So if he's avoiding contact, even though he's paying support, he might be legally in the wrong if the court expects some form of relationship.\n\nEthically, the child has a right to know both parents if possible. The author's refusal to engage in any relationship could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is now old enough to seek information about him. By sending gifts anonymously, he's keeping a minimal presence but not a real relationship. The mother might be trying to help the child connect with the father, which the author is blocking.\n\nHowever, there's the fact that he didn't want children in the first place. But once a child is born, responsibilities come with it. Even if he didn't want kids, biological parenthood usually comes with legal and moral obligations. The author's actions are avoiding any emotional or parental responsibility beyond financial support.\n\nSome might argue that if he genuinely doesn't want to be a parent, that's his choice, but others would say that having a child is a lifelong commitment, and walking away is neglectful. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The ex's attempt to connect could be in the child's best interest, and by refusing, the author is denying that.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as harmful in the long run. The child might feel confused or rejected if they find out about him and he's not part of their life. The anonymous gifts might create questions without answers.\n\nIn terms of the law, if the author is blocking contact that the other parent is trying to arrange, especially if the court has not restricted such contact, he might be violating custody or visitation rights. However, the specifics depend on local laws. If the mother has sole custody and the court hasn't mandated his involvement, maybe he's not legally in the wrong. But ethically, he is.\n\nSo, weighing legal and ethical considerations, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). Even if he's not breaking the law, his actions are ethically questionable as they neglect the child's need for a relationship with both parents.\n"
