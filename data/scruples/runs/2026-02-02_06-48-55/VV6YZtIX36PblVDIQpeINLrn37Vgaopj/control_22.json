I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a child from a past relationship where the author didn't want to be a parent. They offered to pay for an abortion, but the ex wanted to keep the child. They broke up after four months. The author has paid child support consistently but has no contact with the daughter and only sends a birthday gift through the mother.\n\nNow, the key points here are legal and ethical. Legally, he's paying child support, which he's not missing, so he's fulfilling his financial obligations. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding having no contact. Legally, in many places, parents do have rights and responsibilities towards their children. If the other parent is trying to arrange contact and the author is refusing, there might be legal implications if the court had originally ordered some level of involvement. However, in this case, since the original agreement was settled through the courts, maybe the father's lack of contact wasn't enforced if he paid support. \n\nEthically, this is more complex. The child has the right to know their biological father, especially if the mother is facilitating contact. The father's refusal could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial aspects. Even if he didn't want children initially, once the child was born, he became a parent, and disengaging completely might be considered harmful to the child's emotional and psychological well-being. \n\nThe author sends a gift anonymously, which is a minimal gesture but doesn't establish a relationship. The ex is now trying to arrange a meeting, but the father refuses. There's a balance between respecting the father's wishes (he didn't want kids) and the child's right to a relationship. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, a parent can disengage if there's no court order for contact, but if the mother is seeking to involve the father, maybe there's a legal path she can take. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally. The father might be seen as wrong because he's choosing to have no part in his child's life, which could impact the child negatively. Even if he's not legally obligated to be involved, morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility to his child beyond money.\n\nBut others might argue that it's his choice, especially if the mother agreed to not pursue contact. However, the ex is now trying to arrange a meeting, which complicates things. The father's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own wishes over the child's interests. \n\nIn conclusion, while legally he might be okay if he's meeting his obligations, ethically, he's in the wrong for not wanting to have any role in his child's life, which affects the child's right to know both parents. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
