I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion but she chose to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the mother wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if the father didn't want the child, once the child is born, he has legal obligations, which he's fulfilling with child support. But does he have a right to refuse contact? It depends on the laws of his jurisdiction. Some places allow non-custodial parents to have visitation rights unless a court restricts it. If the mother is trying to facilitate contact and the father is blocking it, there could be legal implications.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. While he didn't want children and isn't providing care, he is financially supporting the child. However, emotional and personal involvement is another aspect. Some might argue that a child has a right to know their father, depending on the cultural or personal values. Others might say he wasn't prepared for parenthood and has a right to his own life choices.\n\nThe father's actions: He's been paying support, which is a legal duty. But refusing any contact, even when the mother is trying to arrange it, could be seen as neglecting his parental role beyond just financial. The child might suffer from not having a relationship with the father, even if he's not the primary caregiver.\n\nPossible exceptions: If there were reasons like abuse or the father's mental health that made contact harmful, that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any such issues. It seems like he just didn't want kids and is avoiding involvement.\n\nIn many family law contexts, a parent can't unilaterally cut off contact unless there's a valid reason. Courts often encourage both parents to be involved in a child's life. So if the mother is seeking contact and the father is blocking it, the father might be in the wrong legally and ethically. However, it's also possible that in some cases, if the father shows no interest, the court might not force contact. But the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just whether the court would rule against him.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the father is likely in the wrong because he's denying the child a relationship with him without valid reasons, even though he fulfills financial obligations. So the answer would be A.\n"
