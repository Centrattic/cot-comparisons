I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted the child. They stayed together for a few months, then broke up. He pays child support but hasn't had contact with the kid. The ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation, and the author is fulfilling that. But legal responsibility doesn't necessarily equate to moral or ethical responsibility. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just legally.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the father has a responsibility to be involved in his child's life. Even if he didn't want children initially, once the child exists, some people believe that the parent should take an active role. Others might say that if the father didn't consent to the pregnancy and wasn't prepared to be a parent, he's not obligated to be involved. But then again, the fact that he's paying child support shows some level of responsibility, so maybe not being involved is a different kind of neglect.\n\nThe ex is trying to arrange a meeting, which the author is blocking. The child might have a right to know her father, but the father's right to privacy and his own wishes are also important. However, in some jurisdictions, the child's right to a relationship with both parents is considered, so the father might be legally required to participate. But if the court hasn't mandated contact, then maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nI should also consider cultural and personal values. In some cultures, putting the child's needs above all else is paramount. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if the child is harmed by his absence. On the other hand, if the father has a valid reason (like not wanting a relationship) and the mother is the one in contact, maybe it's his right to not be involved. However, the mother might not be the best person to facilitate contact if the author doesn't want it. But the child's curiosity about the other parent might be natural.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's actions post-birth. He sends gifts but no contact. That could be seen as a minimal gesture, but not a real relationship. Maybe the ex is trying to get him to be more involved because the child is asking about him. If the child is old enough to seek him out, the father's refusal could be problematic. However, the father's right to refuse contact is a factor too.\n\nIn some legal systems, if a parent doesn't have court-ordered contact and is paying support, they might have the right to decline further involvement. But if the ex is trying to push for contact, maybe the father should consider the child's interests. But the father's stance is that he doesn't want to be involved. That's his choice, but some might argue that once you create a child, you have a duty to be part of their life.\n\nSo, considering all angles: legally, he's meeting his obligations. Morally, there's a debate. If the court hasn't ordered contact, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the ex is trying to facilitate contact and he's refusing, especially if the child is interested, that could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. But again, it's his right to refuse. The answer might depend on jurisdiction and specific laws, but generally, if the father is fulfilling his financial duties and there's no legal mandate for contact, he might not be in the wrong. However, morally, some would say he's in the wrong for not engaging more. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just morally. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's not legally obligated, but others might argue he should be involved regardless.\n"
