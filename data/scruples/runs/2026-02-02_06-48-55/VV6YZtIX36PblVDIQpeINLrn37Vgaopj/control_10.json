I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want children, offered an abortion but she decided to have the child. They split up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which is correct. But the question is more about moral responsibility. The author has chosen to disengage from the child's life completely, only sending a gift through the mother without direct contact. The mother is trying to arrange a meeting, but he's refusing.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in the West, there's a strong emphasis on parental involvement. Even if the child's other parent is the legal guardian, the biological father is still expected to have a relationship. However, the author might have his reasons, like never wanting children. But the child has a right to know their father, even if it's not the author's preference. \n\nAborting the child was an option, but the mother chose to keep it. The author's argument is that he never wanted the child, but once the child was born, the father has a responsibility. Even if the author is not a good parent, the child deserves to have a relationship with their father. Refusing all contact could be seen as neglecting that responsibility. \n\nBut wait, the author is paying support, which covers financial needs. Is financial support enough? Some might say no; emotional support and presence are also important. However, others might argue that if the father is not present, the mother should be the one to handle the relationship. Still, the father's absence could have negative effects on the child's well-being. \n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. The author's autonomy to make personal choices is important, but so is the child's right to a parent. The fact that the author has never made an effort to engage beyond financial support suggests a lack of commitment. Choosing to disengage completely might be inconsiderate of the child's needs and the mother's desire. \n\nBut the mother is the one pushing for the meeting now. The author's stance is that he's not interested. Depending on the country's laws, a parent can legally disengage if there's a court order, but even so, the moral obligation is still there. \n\nIn some places, like the US, non-custodial parents are still encouraged to have a relationship unless there's a legal reason to restrict it. The author might be legally allowed to have no contact, but morally, he's avoiding responsibility. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical standards, the author is in the wrong because a child has the right to a relationship with both parents unless there are valid reasons (like abuse) to prevent it. The author hasn't provided such reasons, so his disengagement is ethically questionable.\n"
