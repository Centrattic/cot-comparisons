I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to have the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy and then broke up. He agreed to pay child support through the courts and never missed a payment. Since then, he's had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now, his ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses and asks her not to contact him again.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If child support is being paid, he's fulfilling his legal obligation. Legally, he might not be in the wrong because he's meeting the financial aspect. But legally, there's also the right of the child to have a relationship with the parent, unless there are extenuating circumstances like abuse or neglect. Since there's no mention of such issues here, he's just not wanting any contact.\n\nEthically and morally, this is more complex. The child has a right to know her father, even if the parent doesn't want to be involved. But the father's right to autonomy is also a factor. However, in many societies, the child's best interest is often prioritized. The father is cutting off all contact, which can have emotional and psychological effects on the child. The mother is trying to facilitate contact, which might indicate the child is interested or that the mother believes the child deserves a relationship with the father.\n\nThe author's stance is that he never wanted children and has no interest in being involved. He's fulfilling his financial obligations but not the emotional or parental ones. The question is about being in the wrong, which often depends on societal norms and ethical standards rather than just legal compliance.\n\nI remember that in some cases, even if a parent is paying child support, a court might require visitation if the child is of a certain age and it's in their best interest. However, the author is actively blocking contact now, which could be seen as harmful to the child's well-being. The mother's attempt to arrange a meeting might be in the child's best interest, but the father is refusing.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, he could be considered in the wrong for not engaging with his child at all. The child's right to a relationship with the father is a significant factor here. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) from a moral perspective, even if he's not breaking the law.\n"
