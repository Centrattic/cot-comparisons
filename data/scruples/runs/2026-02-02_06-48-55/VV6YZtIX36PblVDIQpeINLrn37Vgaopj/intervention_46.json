I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author accidentally got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was discovered and then broke up. The author then pays child support as ordered by the courts but has no contact with the child, only sending a birthday gift through the mother.\n\nNow, the ex wants the author to meet their daughter, but the author is refusing and asking not to be contacted again. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, child support is a legal responsibility, so the author is doing the right thing by paying it. But what about the right to have a relationship with the child? Depending on the laws in their country or state, a parent might have the right to be involved in their child's life unless there are reasons like abuse or neglect. The author hasn't been involved beyond financial support, so maybe there's an issue there.\n\nEthically, even if the author didn't want children, once the child is born, the parent has a responsibility beyond just money. Emotional and social development is important for a child, and not having a relationship with the parent might affect that. The author's refusal to even meet the child could be seen as neglecting that responsibility.\n\nBut the author's stance is that they never wanted children and have been paying child support. They might argue that they're fulfilling their obligation by providing financially. However, many experts and legal systems emphasize the importance of a child knowing both parents, especially if there's no harm involved. The author's complete disinterest could be harmful to the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of sending a gift anonymously might not be enough. The child deserves to know about their father and form a relationship if possible. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish or neglectful, even if they didn't want the child initially.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong. Legally, they might have parental rights but also responsibilities. Ethically, they're not fulfilling their role as a parent beyond financial support, which is insufficient. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
