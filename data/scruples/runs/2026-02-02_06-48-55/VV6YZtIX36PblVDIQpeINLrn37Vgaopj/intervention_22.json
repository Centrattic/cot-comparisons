I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want children and offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months then broke up. He pays child support as ordered by the courts and never missed a payment. He hasn't had contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. When the ex wants to arrange a meeting, he refuses and asks her not to contact him again. The ex might be motivated by the daughter's curiosity or her own initiative.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a parent has the right to seek visitation even if the other parent isn't the one seeking contact. The author is fulfilling his financial obligation but not his parental role. Ethically, some might argue that a child has the right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The author is avoiding any contact, which could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond just money. On the other hand, if he was forced into parenthood without wanting it, his feelings might be valid, but the child's right to a relationship could outweigh that. The answer might depend on cultural or societal expectations too. In many cases, fathers are encouraged to be involved, even if the mother is the one initiating contact. So, the author's refusal might be seen as being in the wrong because he's not engaging with his child despite the opportunity. But maybe there are circumstances where a parent can opt out? Not sure. I think the general consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental role beyond financial support, which is a basic expectation in many societies.\n"
