I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting to be involved in their child's life. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want children and offered to pay for an abortion, but she refused. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently but has had no contact with the child. He sends a birthday gift through the mother but doesn't want to meet. Now, the mother wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? Legally, he's fulfilling his financial responsibility, which is his duty as a parent. But emotionally and morally, it's more complex. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. The mother might be trying to connect the child with the father, which is understandable. The author's lack of contact over seven years suggests he's been disengaged. \n\nOn one hand, he's not forcing himself into the child's life, which could be seen as respecting the mother's role. On the other hand, cutting off all contact might deprive the child of a relationship with their father. The fact that he sends a gift anonymously might be a gesture, but it's minimal. \n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong because he's meeting the child support obligations. However, morally, there's a case to be made that a parent has a responsibility beyond financial support. The author's stance is that he never wanted children, so his disengagement is by choice. But the child is a person with their own needs. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because while he's legally compliant, he's denying the child a relationship with their parent. But some people might argue that his right to disengage is valid if he never wanted children. However, the societal expectation is that parents, even absent ones, should have some connection. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author is choosing to remain completely detached, which could harm the child's emotional development. The key point is that the child has a right to know their parent, regardless of the father's initial wishes.\n"
