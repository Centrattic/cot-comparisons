I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she decided to keep the child. They broke up after four months. He pays child support religiously but has had no contact with his daughter. Recently, his ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligations by paying child support, so he's not breaking the law. But morally, is he in the wrong? The father is choosing not to have any relationship with his child. The question is whether he has a moral duty to be involved.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that a parent has a responsibility to be part of their child's life, even if the relationship is challenging. The fact that he sends a birthday gift anonymously might be seen as a minimal effort, but it's not a genuine connection. The daughter might have a right to know her father, especially if she's curious about him. The father's refusal could be seen as selfish, avoiding emotional involvement despite the child's potential need.\n\nHowever, others might say that his decision not to be involved is his own, especially since the mother didn't insist on his presence initially. He's providing financially, which is a significant part of child support. But the emotional support and relationship are different. There's a balance between respecting the mother's decisions and the child's right to know the father.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The father didn't want kids and made that clear. 2) He financially supports the child. 3) He has zero contact otherwise. 4) The mother is now trying to connect the child with him. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, parental responsibility includes both financial and emotional aspects. While he's met the legal requirement, the moral obligation to the child's well-being might extend beyond money. The child's interest in knowing the father could be a valid reason for the father to reconsider. So, his refusal might be seen as neglecting a part of his responsibility as a parent, making him in the wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
