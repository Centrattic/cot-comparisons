I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that he impregnated his girlfriend 7 years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after a few months, he pays child support but has no contact. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. He pays child support, which he's required to do, so legally he's fulfilling that part. But in many places, there are also rights regarding visitation or involvement in a child's life. However, if there's no court-ordered visitation, maybe he's not legally required to have contact. But maybe he could be if the other parent is trying to arrange it now.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The child was conceived through a relationship, even if he didn't want kids. Being a parent is a lifelong commitment, and some people argue that even if you don't want to be involved, you have a responsibility to your child. On the other hand, he had no contact, just sends gifts anonymously. Some might say he's fulfilling his financial duty but neglecting emotional and parental responsibilities.\n\nThe fact that he's been paying support consistently is a point in his favor in terms of responsibility. But completely cutting off contact might be seen as neglectful. The daughter is now 7, so she has a right to know her father, especially if it's in her best interest. However, he might have reasons for not wanting contact, like not being ready or not wanting to be a parent.\n\nIn some cases, if a parent has been absent, the court might require them to take steps to establish a relationship. If the ex is trying to involve him now, maybe he's legally obligated to participate. But the user says he refuses to contact them at all, so that could be an issue.\n\nThe answer depends on legal standards and societal ethics. Legally, maybe he's not wrong if there's no court order for visitation. But ethically, many might say he has a responsibility to his child beyond just money. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the ethical aspect, even if legally he's not required.\n"
