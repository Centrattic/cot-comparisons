I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting any part in their child's life. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, the father not wanting children, offering to pay for an abortion but the mother going ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up after four months, and the father has been paying child support but has no contact. Now the ex wants the father to meet the daughter, and he's resistant.\n\nFirst, legal rights. In many places, fathers have legal rights and responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the father didn't want the child, once paternity is confirmed, he might be required to allow contact, especially if the child's well-being is considered. The fact that he's paying support but avoiding contact could be a legal issue. Courts often encourage parental involvement for the child's benefit.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The father didn't want children and has never engaged with the daughter. From his perspective, he's fulfilling his financial obligations but not more. However, children have a right to know their parents, unless there's a valid reason for no contact (like abuse or danger). The mother initiating contact might be trying to give the daughter a relationship with her father, which the father is blocking. That could be seen as selfish or neglectful.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether legal and ethical responsibilities require the father to be involved. Legally, he might be in the wrong by refusing contact, as courts often prioritize the child's needs. Ethically, it's about the child's right to a relationship versus the father's right to disengage. The father's lack of involvement could be harmful to the child's emotional development. So, likely Answer A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
