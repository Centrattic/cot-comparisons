I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They stayed together for four months after the pregnancy was confirmed, then broke up. The author has been paying child support but has had no contact otherwise. Now the ex wants him to meet their daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, I know that in many places, parents have legal obligations to their children, including financial support and visitation rights. If the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, the author might be legally required to participate if a court orders it. But he hasn't missed any payments, so he's meeting the financial part. However, not having contact could be a legal issue if the court has ordered visitation. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but since the user didn't specify, I'll assume a general case where parental rights include both financial and emotional responsibilities.\n\nEthically, the author is making a conscious choice to not be involved in his child's life. Children have a right to know their parents unless there's a valid reason for separation, like safety. The author's reason is that he never wanted children. But once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility to that child. Not wanting to be involved could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The author sends a gift, but that's a minimal gesture. The child might benefit from a relationship with the father, even if the author isn't interested.\n\nThe author's stance is that he's not interested. But the child has the right to know both parents, assuming they're fit. The author isn't avoiding because of the child's safety but because of personal choice. That could be seen as selfish. However, if the author is a good financial support and the child is with the mother, maybe the mother is the primary caregiver. But still, the child's well-being is a factor.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be \"A\" (Yes) because the author is choosing not to be involved despite a legal and ethical duty to the child. Even if he's paying support, not being part of the child's life could be considered neglectful. The author's argument is that he never wanted children, but once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities beyond just financial ones. The child's right to a relationship with both parents is important, assuming the parent is fit, which the author hasn't indicated any issues with. So, the author's refusal without a valid reason (like abuse) would be seen as wrong.\n"
