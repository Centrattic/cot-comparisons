I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who doesn't want any part in his child's life. He impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want children, offered to pay for an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He pays child support but has no contact. He sends a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses and doesn't want any contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but is that the case? Let's break it down. Legally, he's paying child support, which he's obligated to do. That part is correct. But emotionally and ethically, is he in the wrong by not wanting any relationship with his child?\n\nWell, children have a right to know their parents, right? The father is choosing to cut all ties. Even sending a gift anonymously might not be enough. The mother is trying to facilitate a meeting, maybe because the child is curious. The father is shutting that down completely. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, parental rights aren't entirely cut off unless there's a court order. So even if the parents are separated, the father still has some rights and responsibilities. By refusing to have any contact, he's denying the child the chance to have a relationship with him. Unless there's a valid reason, like harm or abuse, it's generally considered that the child benefits from having a relationship with both parents, assuming it's in their best interest.\n\nThe father's lack of involvement could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond just financial support. Child support is part of it, but emotional and personal involvement is another aspect. So, from a moral standpoint, he might be in the wrong because he's choosing not to engage with his child, which could impact the child's well-being negatively.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the father has the right to choose not to be involved. But generally, society and many legal systems prioritize the child's right to a relationship with both parents unless there are compelling reasons not to. Since there's no mention of abuse or any other issues, his refusal seems to be based on personal choice rather than necessity. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong for not wanting to be part of his child's life despite the child's potential interest.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But I should make sure I didn't miss any nuances. The father didn't push for custody or visitation, which he might be required to do if he wanted to avoid contact. But in some places, you can't legally deny visitation unless there's a court order. So if the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, he might need to legally disengage or there could be consequences. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just legally. Ethically, it's harder to say, but morally, he's neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial support. So yes, A is the answer.\n"
