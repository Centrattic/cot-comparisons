I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up after four months, he pays child support and hasn't had contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet her, but he refuses.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be part of his daughter's life. Legally, he's paying child support, which is correct. But morally and ethically, it's trickier. He's a parent, and children generally benefit from having both parents in their lives. However, the author claims he never wanted children and has no interest. But once a child is born, parental responsibilities extend beyond just financial support. \n\nThere's a difference between not being interested in a relationship and completely cutting off contact. The author's actions\u2014sending a gift through the mother without direct interaction\u2014seem minimal. While he's fulfilling the monetary obligation, he's avoiding any emotional or personal involvement. Some might argue that as a parent, he has a duty to be involved, even if he's not an active participant. Others might say that if he didn't want the child, he shouldn't have contributed to the pregnancy. However, the mother chose to have the child, so the father's responsibility is still there. \n\nThe key points here are legal obligations vs. moral duties. Legally, he's compliant, but morally, he's avoiding his parental role. The fact that he refuses to meet the child, even when asked by his ex, could be seen as neglecting his responsibility. So, I think the answer is A, he is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental duties beyond just money. But maybe some would say B, considering his lack of desire for children. However, generally, once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities are more than just financial. So A makes sense.\n"
