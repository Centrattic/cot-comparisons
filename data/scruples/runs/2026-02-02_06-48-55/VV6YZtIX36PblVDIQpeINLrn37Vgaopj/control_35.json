I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she went ahead with the pregnancy. They broke up, he pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities even if they're not involved. He's paying child support, so maybe he has some legal obligations regarding contact. But some jurisdictions allow for a parent to disengage if a court agrees, though that's not always straightforward.\n\nMoral-wise, there's a debate. The father didn't want the child, but he's financially responsible. However, the child has a right to know her father, even if he wasn't present. The father is sending gifts anonymously, which could be seen as a small gesture but still not building a relationship. The mother wants to arrange a meeting, but the father is resistant. \n\nHe might be in the wrong because, while he can't be forced to be a parent emotionally, there's an argument that he has a duty to be involved. On the other hand, if he's been consistent and the mother has primary custody, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's tricky. The line between legal responsibility and moral obligation isn't clear. The key is whether he's fulfilling his parental duties beyond financial support. Since he hasn't engaged at all, some might say he's neglecting his parental responsibilities, thus being in the wrong. Others might say it's his choice as a parent. But generally, society often expects some level of involvement, so the answer might lean towards A.\n"
