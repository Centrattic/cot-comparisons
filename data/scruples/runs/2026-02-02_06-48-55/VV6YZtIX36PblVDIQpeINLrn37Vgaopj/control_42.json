I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago but didn't want kids. He offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which he's done consistently. That's his responsibility. But legally, does he have any obligation to be involved in the child's life beyond financial support? In many places, parents have rights and responsibilities, but if there's no court order for custody or visitation, maybe he's not legally obligated to get involved. However, ethics might weigh in differently.\n\nEthically, children generally have a right to know their biological parents, especially if it's in their best interest. The author isn't involved, only sending a gift via the mother. The mother is trying to connect the child with him, but he's refusing. This could impact the child's emotional well-being if she's curious about her father. On the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved\u2014for example, he didn't want children in the first place. But is it right to deny the child a relationship with a parent, even if it wasn't wanted?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's role. If she's pushing for the child to meet the father, maybe she's considering the child's needs. But the author might have concerns about being a bad influence or not being a good parent. However, the author hasn't provided any information suggesting that being involved would be harmful. He just states he's not interested.\n\nAnother point: the author hasn't been in contact, which could be seen as neglecting a parental responsibility beyond financial support. While the law might not require it, society often expects some level of involvement. The child might feel confused or deprived if she can't have a relationship with her father.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Ethically, it's more complex. If he's capable of being a positive presence in her life and is choosing not to, that could be considered wrong. But if he's truly incapable or it's against his values, maybe not. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the answer options are A or B, and considering ethical perspectives, the consensus might lean towards A because of the impact on the child. But some might argue B if they believe in a parent's right to disengage. However, in most cases, being a biological parent and refusing any involvement beyond money might be seen as inconsiderate to the child's needs. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
