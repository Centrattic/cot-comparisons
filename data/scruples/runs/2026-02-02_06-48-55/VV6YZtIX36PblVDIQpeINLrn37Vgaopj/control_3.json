      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids, so he offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months, then broke up. He started paying child support through the courts and never missed a payment. Since then, he's had no contact with his daughter, only sending a birthday gift once. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he's refusing and asked not to be contacted about it again. He's unsure if the daughter initiated it or if the ex did.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, legal custody might require some level of contact or visitation rights, especially if the father has been paying child support. But he hasn't been involved, just paying money. Legally, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's fulfilling his financial obligations. However, legally, does paying child support alone absolve him of parental responsibilities? Some jurisdictions might require more involvement.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The father doesn't want any part in the child's life. The child has the right to know her biological father, especially as she gets older. The father's refusal could impact the child's well-being. But the father claims he never wanted children and has been clear about his stance. Is it his right to disengage, or does becoming a parent come with responsibilities beyond money?\n\nThe mother's role here is also important. She might be trying to facilitate contact, which could be in the child's best interest. The father's refusal might be seen as selfish, avoiding emotional or parental responsibilities. On the other hand, if he's not capable of being a father, maybe it's better for the child to not have a relationship that could be harmful or inconsistent.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about legal versus moral responsibility. Legally, he's not in the wrong if he's paying support. Morally, it's more complex. Society often expects parents to be involved, even if they're not in the child's daily life. But the father has no interest, which could be harmful if the child seeks a relationship later.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. If the question is about legal wrong, maybe not. But morally, he could be in the wrong for not engaging with his child. The Reddit format (AITA) usually considers both legal and moral angles. The community might lean towards AITA (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of involvement despite financial support, which might not be enough from a parental responsibility standpoint.\n"
