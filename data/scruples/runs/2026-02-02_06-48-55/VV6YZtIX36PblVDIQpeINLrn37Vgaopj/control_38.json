I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago. He didn't want kids and offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted to keep the baby. They stayed together for four months after that and then broke up. He's been paying child support consistently and hasn't had any contact with his daughter. The only thing he does is send a birthday gift through the mother. Now, the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, parents have legal rights and responsibilities regarding their children. Even if the author didn't want the child, he's been paying child support, which is a legal obligation. But if he's never been involved in the child's life, maybe there's an issue with his parental rights. However, since he's been paying support, that usually means he's recognized as the legal father. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is a parent, biologically, but isn't involved in the child's life. The child might have a right to know their biological father, especially if they're curious about their heritage or want to know him. The mother is trying to facilitate this meeting, which could be because the child is asking about the father. The author is refusing contact, which might be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond just financial support.\n\nBut the author argues he never wanted children and has maintained a respectful distance by sending gifts and paying support. He might feel that his role is fulfilled through financial means, not emotional or physical involvement. However, child development theories suggest that children benefit from having a relationship with both parents, even if the parents aren't together. Denying the child contact might affect the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for not wanting to be involved. Maybe he feels unprepared, doesn't want to complicate the child's life, or has concerns about the ex's handling of the situation. But in terms of responsibility, he did create this situation by impregnating his girlfriend, so some might argue he has a duty to be part of the child's life.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, the author might be allowed to limit contact if it's in the child's best interest, but if the mother is seeking contact and he's refusing without a valid reason, there could be legal repercussions. Ethically, it's a gray area. While he's meeting the financial obligation, emotional and parental involvement is another aspect. The child might suffer from not having a relationship with a parent, which could be seen as the author's fault for not engaging.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors: legal obligations are met, but ethical and emotional aspects are lacking. The author's refusal to meet the child despite the mother's efforts could be considered wrong because it denies the child a potential relationship with their father. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
