I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion, she wanted to keep the baby, they broke up after four months. He pays child support consistently but has no contact with the child except sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is mandatory, and the father has legal responsibilities. However, parental rights can sometimes be more complex. If the father has been absent and not involved, maybe there's a possibility of termination of parental rights if he hasn't been active. But in this case, he's paying support, so he hasn't completely cut off all legal ties.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The child has a right to know their father, but the father clearly stated he never wanted children. The mother might be pushing for contact, perhaps at the child's request. The father's refusal might be seen as selfish, not considering the child's well-being. On the other hand, if he wasn't involved from the start, maybe he doesn't feel responsible for being part of her life now.\n\nThe key points are: he's fulfilling his financial obligation but not emotional or parental. The mother is trying to arrange contact, which he resists. The question is whether he's morally or legally wrong. Legally, he's not wrong since he's paying support. Morally, it's gray. Some might argue it's his choice, others that he should want to be involved.\n\nAlso, the fact that he sends a gift anonymously might show some minimal interest, but he's still not engaging. If the child is asking about him, denying that contact could be harmful. The father's stance is that he never wanted children, but once a child is born, responsibilities extend beyond just financial support. In many cultures, there's an expectation to be involved in a child's life, even if the pregnancy wasn't planned.\n\nSo, considering all angles, even though he's not legally wrong, morally he might be seen as in the wrong for not wanting any part in his daughter's life. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
