I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be part of their child's life. The situation is that the author got their girlfriend pregnant, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months, arranged child support, and have had no contact since. Now the ex wants the author to meet their daughter, but the author is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically waived just because someone didn't want kids. Even if the parent isn't the one seeking contact, there might be legal obligations or rights regarding the child's welfare. However, if the author has been paying child support without issue, that might show some responsibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean they have to be involved beyond financial support.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Some might argue that a child has a right to know both parents, regardless of the parent's initial desires. The author's decision to not be involved could impact the child's life, potentially causing emotional distress when they grow up. On the other hand, if the author truly doesn't want to be involved and the ex is okay with that arrangement, maybe the author isn't \"in the wrong\" legally, but ethically, it's a gray area.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014sending a birthday gift anonymously\u2014might be seen as a minimal effort to maintain a connection, but it's unclear if the child knows it's from them. The key point here is whether the author's refusal to have contact is against any legal mandates or societal expectations.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a parent can't unilaterally refuse contact if the child's well-being is a concern. If the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, the author's refusal could be contested legally. However, if the author's rights as a parent haven't been terminated by a court, they might have the legal right to refuse, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing ethically.\n\nSo, synthesizing this, the author might not be in legal wrong, but ethically or morally, there's a case to be made that they have a responsibility to the child. The answer depends on the context of laws and societal values. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong, so considering both angles, the answer might be A (Yes) if we prioritize the child's right to know their parent, or B (No) if the author's rights and past actions are considered sufficient. But I need to check if the author's refusal is legally permissible first. If the court didn't order contact, then maybe they're not in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's another matter. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which often relates to moral responsibility. So the answer is A because the author is causing potential harm to the child by avoiding their role, regardless of legal rights.\n"
