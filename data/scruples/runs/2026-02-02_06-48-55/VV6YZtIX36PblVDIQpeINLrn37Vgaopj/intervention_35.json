I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion, but she wanted to keep the child. They broke up, he pays child support, and hasn't had contact with the child. Now his ex wants to arrange a meeting, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if the father isn't the primary caregiver, he's financially responsible, and sometimes there are visitation rights unless denied due to specific reasons. But if he hasn't been involved, maybe the court didn't enforce contact. However, the father might still have a legal right to be involved if the court didn't terminate his parental rights. \n\nEthically, the father never wanted a child but became a parent. He's fulfilling the financial part but avoiding any relationship. The child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The father's refusal could be seen as abdicating responsibility beyond just financial support. \n\nThe father's argument is that he never wanted children. But once a child is born, parental responsibilities extend beyond money. The child has the right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason to deny contact (like abuse or neglect). The father hasn't provided any such reason here. \n\nHe sends a gift anonymously, which might be a step, but not engaging further could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The ex is trying to facilitate contact, which could be in the child's best interest. The father is refusing contact, which could lead to the child growing up without a father figure. \n\nSo, legally, if the father has the right to refuse contact, maybe he's not in the wrong. But ethically, it's questionable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong in general. If the court hasn't mandated contact, maybe he's not legally at fault, but socially, there's a strong case against him. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that parents maintain a relationship unless there are extenuating circumstances. Since there's no mention of such circumstances, the father is likely in the wrong ethically. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
