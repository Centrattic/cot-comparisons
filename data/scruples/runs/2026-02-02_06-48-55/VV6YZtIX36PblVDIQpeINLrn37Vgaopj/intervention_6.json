I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she didn't take it. They broke up after four months, he's been paying child support and never had contact with the child. Now his ex wants him to meet the daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author is paying child support as required by the court, so legally he's compliant. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. The author has been absent from the child's life entirely, only sending a birthday gift through the ex. When given a chance to meet the child, he refuses and wants no contact.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the author has a responsibility to be a parent, even if he didn't want children initially. The child has a right to know their father, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. On the other hand, the author didn't want the child and has been fulfilling financial obligations. However, emotional and personal involvement is another aspect. The author's refusal to meet might be seen as avoiding his parental responsibilities beyond just money. \n\nThere's also the fact that the author wasn't interested from the start. But once a child is born, parental duties aren't just financial. The child might have a right to a relationship with both parents. The author is choosing to remain completely detached, which could be harmful to the child's development. So ethically, maybe the author is in the wrong by refusing to engage when given the opportunity. \n\nBut some might say that the author isn't forced to be involved if he never wanted to be, as long as he's financially supporting. However, family law often considers custody and visitation rights even if the parent isn't the primary caregiver. The author could be legally required to have some level of contact, depending on jurisdiction. But since he hasn't been involved and the courts haven't mandated it, maybe it's more of a personal choice. \n\nStill, from a moral perspective, the author's decision to not meet the child could be seen as selfish. The child has a right to know their father, and the author's refusal might be denying the child that relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
