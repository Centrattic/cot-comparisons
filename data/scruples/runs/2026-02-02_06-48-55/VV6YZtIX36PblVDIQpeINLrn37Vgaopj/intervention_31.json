I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got his girlfriend pregnant 7 years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, she wanted to keep the baby, they broke up after 4 months. He's been paying child support ever since but never had contact with the child. Now, he sent a birthday gift through the mother, and when the ex wants to set up a meeting, he refuses. He's not interested in any contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's been paying child support, which is what he's required to do. But child support isn't just about money; in many places, there are provisions for the child to have a relationship with both parents, unless there's a court order restricting that. So if there's no such order, his refusal to have contact might be legally permissible, but ethically, it's a different story.\n\nEthically, the child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The author hasn't been involved at all, not even for birthdays or other milestones beyond sending a gift through the mother. The mother's attempt to arrange a meeting could be for the child's benefit, and the author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing his own lack of desire over the child's potential need for a relationship with him.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the author's initial wishes. He didn't want children, and the pregnancy was unplanned. He did offer to pay for an abortion, which he's often criticized for, but he respected the mother's decision. After the breakup, he's fulfilled his financial obligations. Some might argue that his lack of interest is his right, especially if he's not a fit parent. But others might say that becoming a parent comes with responsibilities beyond money.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities in terms of emotional and personal involvement, even if he's met the legal financial ones. The child might suffer from not knowing the father, depending on the mother's perspective. However, if the author is genuinely not interested and the child isn't harmed by his absence (maybe the mother is handling everything), it's a different scenario.\n\nSo, considering both angles, the author might be in the wrong for not engaging with the child at all, especially if the child is now old enough to be curious about their father. The ethical obligation of a parent isn't just financial; it's also about being part of the child's life. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But some might argue that it's his right to choose not to be involved. However, given the child's right to know their parent, the author's stance is likely ethically questionable.\n"
