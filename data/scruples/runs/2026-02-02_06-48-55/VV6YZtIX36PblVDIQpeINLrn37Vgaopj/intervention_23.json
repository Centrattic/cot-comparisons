I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered an abortion but she wanted to have the child. They broke up after four months, he paid child support as ordered by the courts, had no contact with his daughter, only sent gifts anonymously. Now the ex wants him to meet the daughter, he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspects. In many places, parents have a legal right to have contact with their children unless there's a court order restricting that. The author is paying child support but has no contact. Legally, maybe he could be in trouble if the court hasn't restricted contact. But he hasn't missed any payments, so maybe he's meeting his financial obligations but not emotional ones.\n\nMoral aspect: The child has a right to know her father, even if the author didn't want kids. The author is actively avoiding any relationship, which might be harmful to the child's well-being. The mother is trying to facilitate contact, which is common for parents to want their children to have a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason (like abuse). The author's refusal without explanation could be seen as selfish, not considering the child's needs.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't want children and was clear about it. He's fulfilling his financial duty. Maybe he's not in the wrong legally, but morally, he's neglecting his parental responsibility beyond just money. Children need more than support; they need a relationship. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's denying the child a relationship with her father, which could impact her emotionally and socially.\n\nAlso, the court might have allowed contact unless there's a reason to block it. If the author is blocking contact without legal justification, that's a problem. The ex is trying to arrange a meeting, which the author is refusing. The author's stance could be seen as avoiding responsibility beyond just financial aspects. So, morally and possibly legally, he might be at fault here.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while he's meeting financial obligations, he's neglecting the emotional and relational aspects of parenthood, which are important for the child's development. The child has a right to know her father unless there are valid reasons to prevent it, which aren't mentioned here.\n"
