I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted the child. They broke up after four months, and he's been paying child support but has had no contact with his daughter. Now his ex wants to arrange a meeting, and he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, parents have the right to be involved in their child's life unless there are specific legal restrictions. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but not being involved beyond that. However, if the other parent is trying to facilitate contact, the author's refusal might impact the child's relationship with both parents.\n\nEthically, the author is choosing to remain detached. The child has a right to know both parents, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. The ex is likely trying to provide the child with that connection. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the child's well-being. \n\nBut there's also context. The author didn't want children and was against the pregnancy. It's possible that he feels unprepared or unwilling to be a parent, which is a personal choice. However, the child's interest in having a relationship with the father is important, and the author's refusal might prevent that. \n\nLegally, depending on the country, the non-custodial parent might have rights to contact, but if there's no court order for contact, the author can refuse. But ethically, many would argue that the child deserves a relationship with both parents. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't violating the law by not engaging beyond support, but morally, it's a different story. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the ethical responsibility towards the child's well-being and the right to know both parents.\n"
