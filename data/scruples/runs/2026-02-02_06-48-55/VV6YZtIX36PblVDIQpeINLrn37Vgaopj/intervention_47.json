I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want children, impregnated his girlfriend, offered to pay for an abortion but she wanted to keep the baby. They broke up, he pays child support but has no contact with his daughter. Now, his ex wants him to meet his daughter, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically forfeited just because you don't have a relationship with your child. Even if the father didn't want the child initially, once the child is born, he has legal responsibilities. The fact that he pays child support shows he's meeting financial obligations. But what about visitation? Depending on the jurisdiction, a non-custodial parent might have the right to seek visitation. If he's blocking contact that the ex is trying to arrange, there could be legal implications.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author has been paying child support but has no relationship with his child. The ex wants him to meet the daughter, which could be the child's idea or the mother's. The author is dismissive, not even interested in meeting. Some might argue that a child has a right to know their father, even if the father wasn't planning on having a child. The author's stance is that he never wanted children, but once a child exists, does that create a moral obligation to be involved?\n\nAlso, the way he sends a birthday gift anonymously could be seen as a way to maintain some connection without commitment. But when the ex approaches him to meet, he refuses outright. That might be seen as prioritizing his own lack of desire for a relationship over the child's potential need for a father figure.\n\nHowever, others might argue that he was clear from the start about not wanting children and has followed through on his responsibilities (child support). If he's never been in the child's life, maybe he's not the wrong one, especially if the mother is the one arranging things without his consent. It's a bit of a gray area, but legally and ethically, there's a push towards the father being involved, even if reluctantly.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author is in the wrong. He's not fulfilling the emotional and relational part of parenthood, which is important for the child's well-being. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child is born, there are obligations beyond just financial support.\n"
