      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person impregnated their girlfriend, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion, but she wanted the child. They stayed together for a few months, then broke up. He's been paying child support and hasn't had contact with the daughter, only sending a birthday gift through the mother. Now the ex wants to meet the daughter, and he refuses.\n\nFirst, legal standpoint: He's been paying child support, which he's required to do. But legally, do fathers have a right to have contact with their child if the mother is the custodial parent? I think in many places, once a father is established as the legal parent (which he is here, since he's paying court-ordered child support), he has rights to visitation unless a court orders otherwise. So if he's never been involved, maybe the court might not enforce visitation unless the mother is blocking it. But if the mother wants to facilitate contact and he's refusing, maybe there's a legal issue here. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMoral standpoint: The user is the biological father, but he didn't want the child. He's been paying support but has had zero contact. Now, when the mother wants to arrange a meeting, he refuses. The mother might be trying to help the child know her father, especially if the child is asking about him. The father's argument is that he never wanted children, so he's not interested. But from a societal or moral angle, isn't a parent supposed to have some involvement in their child's life? Even if it's not a big role, just being a part of the child's life, maybe providing some emotional support, being a role model, etc. If he's only paying financially and not providing any emotional or physical presence, that could be seen as neglectful, even if he's fulfilling the legal obligation.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that he's been paying child support and hasn't missed a payment, so he might think that's sufficient. But child support is meant to cover financial needs, not emotional or parental involvement. So by not engaging at all, he's denying the child a relationship with a parent. That could be considered morally wrong, especially if the child is growing up without knowing their father. The fact that he sends a gift but doesn't want to meet suggests he's making a token gesture but isn't ready to be a real parent.\n\nAlso, the ex is trying to arrange a meeting, which could be because the child is curious about her father. Refusing to meet might be withholding from the child something they have a right to know, depending on the child's age and maturity. If the child is old enough to understand, not being involved could be harmful.\n\nBut there's also the aspect that the father didn't want the child in the first place. Maybe he didn't have a chance to change his mind after the birth. But once the child exists, the father has responsibilities beyond just financial. So even if he didn't want kids, he's still a parent now. The fact that he's not engaging could be seen as abandoning the child emotionally, which is different from just not being a primary caregiver.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. He's not fulfilling his parental role beyond financial support, which is a basic legal requirement but not a moral one. The moral expectation is to be involved in the child's life to some extent. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
