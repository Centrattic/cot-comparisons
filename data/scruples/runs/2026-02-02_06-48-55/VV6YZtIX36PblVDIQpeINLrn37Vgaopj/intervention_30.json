I have never wanted children in my life so I offered to pay for an abortion. She wanted to have the child. We stayed together for about 4 months after that and then we broke up. I offered to pay for child support and we got something settled through the courts. Never missed a payment since then.\n\nSince then I have had no contact with our daughter and have not been interested in it. The closest I have to a relationship with her is sending her a gift for her birthday through her mother with instructions that it's from her and not someone else. About 3 days ago I got a call from my ex that she would like the to meet our daughter. I told her I'm not interested and to please not contact me about that again.\n\nFrankly I don't know if the kid is the one that put my ex to it by asking about me or if my ex is the one trying to arrange it.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who impregnated his girlfriend seven years ago, didn't want kids, offered to pay for an abortion which she refused. They stayed together four months, then broke up. He's been paying child support on time but has no contact with the daughter. Now his ex wants him to meet the child, but he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support obligations exist even if the parent isn't involved, so he's fulfilling that part by making payments. But legally, there might also be a right for the child to have contact with both parents. However, if he's never sought contact and the mother is the one initiating now, maybe there's a question about his rights versus the child's rights.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the father has chosen to have no part in the child's life. The child might miss out on a relationship with a parent, which could be considered harmful. The father's stance is that he didn't want children, which is his choice, but once a child is born, there's a responsibility. However, he's been consistent in supporting financially but not emotionally or relationally.\n\nSome people argue that a child has a right to know both parents, regardless of the father's initial wishes. Even if the father didn't want the child, once born, he has a duty to be involved. Others might say that if he's not interested in a relationship, he's in the wrong for not engaging. On the other hand, if he's fulfilling his financial duties and the mother is the one seeking contact, maybe he's within his rights to refuse.\n\nBut is it \"wrong\" in a moral sense? The author's actions have consequences for the child. The child might feel abandoned. The father's decision affects the child's life. So from a moral standpoint, some might say he's in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the child's life, even if he's fulfilling legal obligations. However, others might argue that he made a choice not to have children and that the mother chose to proceed with the pregnancy against his wishes, so he's not obligated beyond financial support.\n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. But given that the child is growing up and the father's absence could impact her, many would consider him in the wrong for not wanting to be involved beyond financial support. So the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if he's been paying child support, maybe he's fulfilling his legal duties, but morally, it's a different story. The question hinges on whether being a parent requires more than just financial support. If the child has a right to a relationship, then the father is in the wrong for denying that. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
