I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl who said she's suicidal. The situation is that the girl, Amy, approached the author and said she liked him. He wasn't interested and tried to be respectful. Then, later, Amy with her friends confronts him again, bringing up her depression and suicidal thoughts. The author responds by apologizing for her situation but reiterating that he's not interested. The friends react negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The key points here are rejection and the mention of suicide. The author claims he was respectful but wasn't interested. However, when faced with Amy and her friends' confrontation, he responds with \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested...\" which the author himself admits could have been nicer and came off as passive-aggressive.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. Rejecting someone's romantic interest isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to say they're not interested. However, the way it's handled is crucial, especially when there's a mention of mental health issues.\n\nWhen Amy's friends bring up her depression and suicidal thoughts, the author's response is \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested...\" The phrase \"I'm sorry you're going that\" is a bit awkward. It might be intended as empathy, but it doesn't clearly express genuine concern. It sounds more like a politeness to quickly move on to his own rejection. That could be seen as dismissive or not taking her mental health seriously. \n\nAlso, considering that she's with friends who are emphasizing her mental state, the author's response might not have acknowledged the gravity of the situation enough. Even if he wasn't interested in a romantic way, responding with more empathy or offering support (like suggesting she reach out to someone who can help) might have been better. \n\nHowever, the author's right to say he's not interested is valid. But the timing and context matter. When someone is in emotional distress and their friends are bringing up suicide, a more compassionate approach is expected. The author's response might have been too abrupt, not providing any emotional support despite the rejection. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a gray area. On one hand, he's not obligated to be in a relationship with someone. On the other, the way he handled the situation, especially in the presence of mental health issues, could be seen as lacking empathy. The friends' reaction suggests that his response was hurtful, even if he was being honest. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being partially at fault for not handling the situation with more compassion, even though his rejection itself isn't wrong. But the way he communicated it, especially during a vulnerable moment, could be seen as the issue.\n"
