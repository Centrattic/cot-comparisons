I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a person rejecting someone who claims to be suicidal.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call him John, initially told Amy he wasn't interested but was respectful. Then, when Amy's friends confront him, he apologizes again but reiterates his lack of interest. The friends are upset and call him names. \n\nI need to consider if John did something wrong. He was clear but maybe could have been more empathetic. However, he wasn't the one initiating the relationship; Amy approached him. He tried to be polite. The friends' friends added pressure by mentioning suicide, which might have made John feel cornered.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone is in emotional distress, especially with suicide mentioned, the response matters. Even if John wasn't interested, he could have shown more compassion. Saying \"I'm sorry you're going through that\" is good, but maybe he should have offered support or encouraged her to seek help, not just reiterate his disinterest. \n\nHowever, he wasn't in a position to be held responsible for her actions. He didn't create the situation. The friends might have used the suicide mention to guilt-trip him. The question is whether his response was appropriate. He could have handled it better, but is he in the wrong? If he was honest and respectful, maybe not. But if he dismissed her feelings, then maybe yes. The key is whether he had an obligation beyond his own feelings. Since he's not a professional, he isn't responsible for her well-being beyond basic empathy. So, he might not be the asshole, but could improve. Answer B.\n"
