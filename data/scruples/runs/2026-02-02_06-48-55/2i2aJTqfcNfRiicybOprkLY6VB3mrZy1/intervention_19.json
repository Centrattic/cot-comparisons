I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is that a girl, Amy, approached him and said she liked him. He wasn't interested and tried to be respectful. Then, when she came back with friends, they accused him of causing her to feel suicidal. He responded by apologizing for her feelings but reiterating he's not interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. The main issue here is whether his actions contributed to or were responsible for Amy's suicidal thoughts. The user says he tried to be respectful, but maybe the way he rejected her wasn't handled well enough. The friends are there, so the conversation is in front of others, which might have added pressure.\n\nWhen Amy comes back with friends, they're using her mental health as a way to guilt-trip him. He responds politely but it's passive-aggressive. The question is, did he do something wrong? Well, he didn't initiate harm, but if someone is in a vulnerable state, you might need to be more cautious. However, he did acknowledge her struggles and wished her well. The friends are there, so maybe they're amplifying the situation. \n\nBut is he responsible for her mental state? People are responsible for their own actions. However, if he knew she was in a suicidal state, he might need to take more steps, like not rejecting her or encouraging her to seek help. But in this case, he did apologize and say he wished her the best. The friends are using the suicide threat as a tactic, not necessarily a genuine cry for help. \n\nSo, was he in the wrong? It depends on whether his rejection was the direct cause. If he was aware of her mental state before, maybe he should have been more careful. But he rejected her politely. The friends are probably trying to make him feel guilty. The author's actions don't seem malicious. He might have handled it better, but being in the wrong is a bit harsh. The real issue is the friends using her mental health as a weapon. \n\nSo, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong. He tried to be respectful, and while the situation is unfortunate, he's not the one causing her issues. The friends are manipulating the situation.\n"
