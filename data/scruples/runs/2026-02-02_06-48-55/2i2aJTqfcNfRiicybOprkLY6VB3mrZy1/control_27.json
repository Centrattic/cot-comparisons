I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about rejecting a girl labeled as 'suicidal' is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, let's call him Alex, who was approached by Amy, who liked him. Alex wasn't interested and tried to be respectful. Later, Amy comes back with friends who accuse him of contributing to her depression and suicidal thoughts. Alex responds by saying he's not interested and wishes her the best, but the tone might have been passive-aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Amy is struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. Alex rejected her feelings but didn't necessarily know the extent of her mental health issues. The friends are present and are vocal about their disapproval, which might be adding pressure on Alex to feel guilty or to take responsibility. The main question is whether Alex is in the wrong for not reciprocating her feelings and for his response.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to not be in a relationship if they're not interested. However, when mental health is involved, especially with mentions of suicide, it complicates things. Alex might be seen as not taking responsibility for his role in Amy's emotional state. On the other hand, he's not obligated to enter a relationship to prevent someone else's suicide. The friends' presence and their accusations might be a form of guilt-tripping.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how Alex handled the rejection. He tried to be respectful, but his response came off as passive-aggressive. Even if he wasn't interested, there's a way to communicate that without causing additional harm. The friends' reactions suggest that Amy might have been emotionally vulnerable, and Alex's rejection could have exacerbated her mental health issues, even if unintentionally.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Amy's friends were present and perhaps used their influence to frame the situation as Alex being the problem. The friends might be projecting their own judgment onto Alex. The key here is whether Alex had a duty of care. In general, unless there's a direct threat, people aren't legally or morally responsible for another's mental health struggles. But emotionally, the rejection could have been a trigger, which is a gray area.\n\nSo, is Alex in the wrong? If the question is about taking a relationship he didn't want, then no. But if it's about not considering Amy's mental state and how his actions might affect her, then maybe there's some responsibility. However, the friends' presence and their accusations might have been manipulative. The answer depends on whether the rejection itself is considered the wrong, or if the handling of the situation could have been better.\n\nIn conclusion, while Alex isn't obligated to be in a relationship, the way he handled the situation could have been more empathetic, considering Amy's mental health. However, the friends' involvement complicates the scenario. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he wasn't in a relationship and isn't responsible for her mental health, but there's room for improvement in his communication.\n"
