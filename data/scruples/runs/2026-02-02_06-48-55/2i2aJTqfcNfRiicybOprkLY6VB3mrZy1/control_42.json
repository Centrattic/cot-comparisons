I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, let's call him John, rejected a girl named Amy who liked him. Amy then approached him again with friends who accused him of contributing to her suicidal thoughts. John tried to apologize but was called names.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if John's actions were inappropriate. He initially rejected Amy respectfully, which seems okay. Then, when confronted by Amy and her friends, he said he wasn't interested but wished her well. The friends accused him of being an asshole because he rejected Amy, who was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe key points here: Did John's rejection directly cause or contribute to Amy's suicidal thoughts? If Amy was already struggling, John might have a responsibility to handle the situation with care. However, the friends are making the accusations in front of him. John's response was to apologize and state he's not interested. His tone might have been passive-aggressive, which is a problem, but the main issue is whether he had an obligation to not reject her given her mental state.\n\nBut here's the catch: Amy approached him twice. The first time, he declined politely. The second time, she came with friends who were hostile. John's rejection might have been valid because he wasn't interested, but the way he handled it could have been better. However, the friends' behavior seems aggressive, using Amy's mental health issues to guilt-trip him. \n\nIs John responsible for Amy's mental health? Probably not directly. People are responsible for their own actions. However, if someone known to be in a vulnerable state is rejected, there's a question of empathy. But Amy's friends are using her mental health as a weapon here. John's response was to express empathy and then state his position. The friends' reaction is hostile and perhaps using guilt to manipulate him.\n\nSo, is John in the wrong? He didn't do anything illegal. He rejected her respectfully. The friends are the ones using emotional manipulation. However, if Amy's mental state was known beforehand, maybe John should have been more cautious. But the scenario doesn't mention prior knowledge of her depression before the confrontation. He learned about it during their second encounter. In that case, he tried to apologize, but the friends were aggressive. \n\nGiven that, John's actions don't seem wrong. The friends are the ones misusing Amy's situation to attack him. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
