I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl named Amy who approached him, expressed interest, and then after being rejected, he was confronted by her and her friends about her suicidal thoughts.\n\nFirst, the author rejected Amy's advances, which is his right. He tried to be respectful. Then, Amy's friends confronted him, bringing up her depression and suicide. The author responds by apologizing for her struggles but reiterates he's not interested. The friends get angry and call him names.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and boundaries. The author wasn't in the wrong for rejecting Amy; that's a personal choice. However, when confronted with her mental health issues, his response might have been more compassionate. Saying \"I'm sorry you're going through that\" is a start, but it's possible he could have shown more empathy. However, he's not obligated to pursue a relationship to help someone's mental health. The friends' approach was aggressive and used her vulnerability as a weapon, which is manipulative. The author's passive-aggressive tone might not have helped, but the core issue is Amy's friends exploiting her mental health to guilt-trip him. The author's main mistake was not handling it with more sensitivity, but he's not in the wrong for not being interested. So the answer is B.\n"
