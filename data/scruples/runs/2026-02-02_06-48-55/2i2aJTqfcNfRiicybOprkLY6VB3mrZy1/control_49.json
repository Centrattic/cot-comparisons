I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong after rejecting a girl who claims she's suicidal. The key points here are the initial rejection and how it was handled. \n\nFirst, when Amy first approached him, he said he let her down easy. Then, when she came with friends later, she and her friends confront him about her suicidal thoughts. The question is whether his response was appropriate.\n\nHe says he was defensive and replied that he's not interested but wishes her the best. The friends reacted negatively. The person is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider the context of the suicidal claims. Even if the truth is that Amy might not be genuinely suicidal, the author knew she was making that claim. His response was to reiterate his disinterest, which could come off as dismissive. Even if he's not interested, responding to someone with mental health issues needs to be handled with care.\n\nThe friends might have felt that he wasn't taking her situation seriously. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether he should have taken more steps to ensure Amy's well-being beyond just saying he's not interested.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to acknowledge the person's feelings, express concern, and perhaps suggest professional help. The author's response was polite but passive-aggressive, which might not be sufficient given the serious nature of the claims. Even if his initial rejection was kind, the second interaction could have been handled better by showing more empathy and concern for her mental health.\n\nSo, while he's not in the wrong in the sense that he's allowed to reject someone, the way he handled the second confrontation might have been dismissive. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) but with the consideration that he could have handled it better.\n"
