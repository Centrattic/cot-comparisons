I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl who claimed she was suicidal. The situation involves Amy approaching the author, expressing interest, being rejected, and then later approaching again with friends, making the author feel uncomfortable. The author responds politely but the group reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author initially rejected Amy in a respectful manner. Then, when approached again by Amy and her friends, the author tried to be empathetic but still maintained that they weren't interested. The friends then accused the author of causing Amy's suicidal thoughts. The author's response was to express sympathy but remain firm in their disinterest. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author was clear and polite in their rejection. The friends and Amy's reaction seems to be the real issue here. The friends are essentially using Amy's mental health as a weapon to guilt-trip the author. It's possible that Amy is not truly suicidal or the situation is being exaggerated. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the potential impact of the author's rejection on Amy's mental health. Even if the author was polite, rejecting someone who is already struggling with depression could contribute to their feelings. But the author can't be held responsible if Amy is already in a vulnerable state. The friends' aggressive behavior and public shaming might be more problematic than the author's rejection. \n\nIn terms of handling it better, maybe the author could have offered to speak with a counselor or suggested professional help if they genuinely believed Amy was in danger. But given the context, the friends might have been using that as a ploy. The author's response was direct, and while it could have been more compassionate, it's not clear if that would have changed the outcome. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to be respectful, and the friends' reaction is more about their own behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
