I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl who later claims to be suicidal. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, let's call him John, was approached by Amy who expressed interest. He politely rejected her. Then, Amy comes back with friends who accuse him of contributing to her depression and suicidal thoughts. John responds by apologizing for her struggles but reiterates he's not interested. The friends leave angry.\n\nNow, the key points. John did reject Amy, which can be tough, but he tried to be respectful. The friends confronted him in a group, which might have been intimidating. He apologized for her issues but didn't back down from his rejection. The friends called him names, suggesting they felt he was at fault. But Amy was present, so maybe she didn't want to confront him herself.\n\nIs John in the wrong? Well, rejecting someone isn't inherently wrong. People can have different reactions. Amy's friends might be using her mental health to deflect blame. John's response was direct but not cruel. He offered well-wishes. However, maybe he could have been more empathetic in his delivery, but he did say he could have been nicer. The friends' aggression might be their own fault for reacting that way. \n\nThe main issue is whether John's rejection caused harm. While his actions were honest, the friends' accusations might be exaggerated. But if Amy truly is struggling, maybe a follow-up check-in would be better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since he didn't intentionally harm her, and she wasn't in immediate danger when he rejected her, he's probably not the asshole. The friends' reaction might be overblown. So I think the answer is B.\n"
