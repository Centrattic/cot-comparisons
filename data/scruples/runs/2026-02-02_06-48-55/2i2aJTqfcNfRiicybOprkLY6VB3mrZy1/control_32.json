I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, let's call him Alex, rejected a girl named Amy who approached him with feelings. Then, when Amy and her friends confronted him again, he apologized but said he's not interested. The friends accused him of contributing to her depression and suicide thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Amy approached Alex, expressed interest, and he politely rejected her. Later, when confronted again, he tried to be respectful but firm. The key points here are that Alex was honest about his feelings, tried to be respectful, and even apologized. The friends accused him of causing harm, but there's no evidence that his rejection directly caused her suicidal thoughts. \n\nNow, considering societal expectations. People often expect honesty in such situations, and it's important to be kind. However, Amy's friends are using her mental health as a weapon here, which might be manipulative. The author tried to handle it as best as he could, even if the response could have been more empathetic. But he wasn't aggressive or cruel. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't act maliciously and was upfront, the answer might lean towards B. However, I should check if there's any aspect where he could have done better. Maybe he could have offered support or suggested she talk to someone, but the user says he did apologize and say he wished her the best. \n\nAlso, the friends might be using the suicide comment to guilt-trip him. If Amy was genuinely at risk, maybe there's a duty to help, but the author isn't in a position to provide that support. His response was honest, and he can't be held responsible for her mental health issues unless he knew she was in immediate danger. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he was truthful, tried to be polite, and didn't disregard her feelings. The friends' aggressive confrontation doesn't justify his responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
