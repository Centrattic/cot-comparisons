I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about rejecting someone who is emotionally vulnerable.\n\nFirst, the author initially rejected Amy when she expressed interest, which he did in a respectful way, according to him. Then, when Amy approaches again with friends and friends accuse him of causing harm, he responds by saying he's not interested but wishes her well. The friends react negatively, calling him names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. I need to consider if his actions and response were appropriate. When dealing with someone who is suicidal or has depression, it's important to handle the situation with care. The author's initial rejection might not be the issue, but the way he handled the follow-up encounter could be problematic.\n\nHe responded in a way that might have come off as dismissive or passive-aggressive. Even if he wasn't interested, acknowledging her feelings and offering support might have been better. Saying \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested\" could be seen as not taking her mental health seriously, especially in front of her friends. It's possible he didn't know how to respond properly under pressure, leading to a harsh response.\n\nSo, maybe the author is not entirely wrong because he did reject her respectfully first, but the second interaction could have been handled better. However, considering the context of her mental state and the friends' accusations, the way he responded might have been insensitivity, even if he meant well. The key is whether he should have done more to support her despite his lack of interest.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because even though he wasn't interested, the response in the second encounter might have been dismissive and could have exacerbated her mental health issues. It's important to be empathetic in such situations, even if you can't reciprocate feelings.\n"
