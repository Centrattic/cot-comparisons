I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, let's call him John, rejected a girl named Amy who had feelings for him. Amy then approached him again with friends, accusing him of making her suicidal, and John responded by reiterating that he's not interested. The friends were hostile, and now John is wondering if he was the asshole.\n\nFirst, John initially tried to reject Amy respectfully. That's good. He didn't lead her on or ignore her. But when she came back with friends, he felt uncomfortable. His friends were confronting him, which is aggressive. He responded by apologizing for her issues but clarified he's not interested. The friends were hostile, but Amy was present. The key here is whether John's response was appropriate given the situation.\n\nHe tried to be polite, even though the group was pressuring him. He didn't lash out beyond stating his position again. The friends' reactions were harsh, but John's response was to express his position in a respectful way. However, he might have come off as passive-aggressive. But considering Amy's emotional state and the friends' aggression, he might have done the best he could under pressure. Was he responsible for her mental health? Not really. He can't be blamed for her reactions. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was honest and respectful, even if not perfectly, he's not the asshole. So B.\n"
