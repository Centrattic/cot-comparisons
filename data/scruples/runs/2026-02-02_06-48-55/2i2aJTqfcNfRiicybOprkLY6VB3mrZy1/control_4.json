I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl who claimed to be suicidal. The situation involves Amy approaching the author and expressing interest. The author, not interested, turned her down politely. Then, Amy with friends confronts him again, mentioning her depression and suicide thoughts. He apologizes for not being interested and wishes her well. The friends react negatively.\n\nFirst, the author did reject someone who later mentioned suicidal thoughts. Did he have a duty to respond differently? Well, when someone is in crisis, even if the initial interaction was a romantic rejection, the author's responsibility might extend to ensuring their well-being. But he did try to be respectful and even apologized. However, maybe he could have offered more support or considered the emotional state of Amy when rejecting her. The passive-aggressive tone might have contributed to her distress. But since the author wasn't aware of her suicidal thoughts at the time of the first rejection, maybe he can't be blamed for that. However, when confronted again with friends, the author had a chance to show more empathy. He did apologize, but perhaps not enough. The friends' harsh reactions might be their own fault, but the author's response could have been better. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but he could have handled it better. The key is whether his actions directly caused harm. Since Amy didn't act on her threats, maybe the author isn't the asshole, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B (No), but with the note that he could have been more considerate.\n"
