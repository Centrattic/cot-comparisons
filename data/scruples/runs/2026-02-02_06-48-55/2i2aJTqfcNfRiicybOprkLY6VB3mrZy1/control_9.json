I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, let's call him Alex, met a girl named Amy who approached him and said she liked him. Alex was not interested and tried to be respectful. Then, later, Amy comes back with two friends, and they confront Alex about her depression and suicidal thoughts. Alex responds by apologizing for her struggles but reiterates that he's not interested. The friends get angry and call him names. Now Alex is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, respect, and handling someone's mental health. When someone is suicidal, it's a serious matter. But does that obligation extend to being in a relationship or accepting someone's advances?\n\nFirst, Alex did reject Amy when she first approached him. He did it as respectfully as he could. Then, when she comes back with friends, maybe they're trying to guilt-trail him. Amy's friends are using her mental health as a reason to pressure Alex. But Alex isn't responsible for her mental health. He tried to be kind again, even if it came off as passive-aggressive. The main issue is whether his rejection was inappropriate given her situation.\n\nBut here's the thing: you can't be forced into a relationship because someone is suicidal. It's not a reason to accept someone's feelings. However, the way the friends approached him might have been aggressive or manipulative. Alex's response was direct but not cruel. He apologized for her struggles and stated his position. The friends then called him names, which could be the real problem here.\n\nSo, is Alex in the wrong? Probably not. He was clear about his feelings and tried to be respectful. The friends might have overstepped by using Amy's mental health to pressure him. It's possible they were trying to shame him into accepting a relationship, which is inappropriate. Alex isn't obligated to comfort her in a romantic way, but the friends' reaction suggests they didn't handle it well. The real issue here might be the friends' behavior, not Alex's. So the answer is B, No.\n"
