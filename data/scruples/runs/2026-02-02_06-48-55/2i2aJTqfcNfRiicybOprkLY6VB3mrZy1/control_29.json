I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves rejecting someone who claims to be suicidal. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author, let's call him John, was approached by a girl named Amy who liked him. He politely rejected her. Then, later, Amy and her friends confronted him again, saying she's struggling with depression and suicide. John responded by apologizing and saying he's not interested, which came off as passive-aggressive. The friends left angry, calling him names.\n\nNow, is John in the wrong? Well, rejecting someone's romantic interest isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to set boundaries. The issue here might be how he handled the second confrontation. The friends brought up Amy's mental health during the confrontation, which could have been a tactic to guilt-trip John.\n\nJohn's response was to reiterate his position, but it's possible he could have shown more empathy. Even if he wasn't interested, acknowledging her feelings and maybe offering support could have been better. However, he did say he wished her the best. The friends' reaction was hostile, but that's their response, not necessarily his fault.\n\nThe question is whether not being interested and politely declining makes him the asshole. If Amy was genuinely suicidal, maybe John should have encouraged her to seek help. But the story says he apologized and offered good wishes. The friends might have exaggerated the situation to pressure him. \n\nBut there's a risk that the friends used the mental health issue as an excuse to confront him. It's important to take mental health seriously, but John's responsibility is to respond appropriately. Maybe he could have been more compassionate in his rejection. However, the core issue is his lack of interest, which isn't a moral failing. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but with the nuance that he could have handled it better. But the main question is about being in the wrong, not about how to improve. Since he didn't act maliciously and took their concerns into account, he's not in the wrong. The friends' hostility is their own issue.\n"
