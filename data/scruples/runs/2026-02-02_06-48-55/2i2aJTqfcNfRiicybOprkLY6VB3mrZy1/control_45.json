I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves rejecting a girl who later claims to be suicidal.\n\nFirst, the author initially rejected Amy, which might not be the issue itself. When people express interest and get rejected, it's common and not necessarily wrong. The key point is how the rejection was handled.\n\nThen, Amy approaches again with friends and friends accuse the author of contributing to her depression and suicidal thoughts. The author responds by apologizing to Amy but reiterates their lack of interest. The friends react negatively.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Amy's friends are saying she's struggling, but the author didn't know about her mental state when they first rejected her. However, the second encounter could have been handled better. The author's response was passive-aggressive, which might have escalated the situation. But the author didn't make the original problem; they're not responsible for Amy's mental health struggles. The friends used the suicide threat to guilt-trip the author. The author's rejection isn't the same as causing harm; that's a stretch. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They could have been more empathetic, but the core issue is Amy's and her friends' reaction, not the author's initial rejection or the passive-aggressive response.\n"
