I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is that the author rejected a girl named Amy who approached him with feelings, and later when Amy and her friends confronted him, he apologized but said he wasn't interested. The friends accused him of causing her suicide thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author claims he was respectful when Amy first approached him. Then, when her friends confronted him, he said he was sorry but wasn't interested. The friends made him feel defensive. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the author's actions: He rejected Amy, which is his right. When confronted, he tried to apologize but maintained his stance. The friends' reaction included aggressive language. The author's response was direct but possibly passive-aggressive. The friends' accusations are that his rejection caused Amy's suicidal thoughts. However, the author isn't responsible for Amy's mental health decisions. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong. He rejected her, which isn't in itself wrong. His response to the confrontation was firm but not hostile. He apologized and wished her the best. The friends' hostility is their own responsibility. The author didn't threaten or harm Amy. He's not obligated to have a relationship to be compassionate. However, maybe he could have handled it better, like offering support, but that's about handling it better, not being in the wrong. \n\nAre there any ethical issues? The author isn't in the wrong for not being interested. He's not responsible for her mental health crisis. The friends' approach was shaming him, which could be toxic. The author's response was measured. The answer would be B, he's not the asshole. But need to consider if his initial rejection was too harsh. But he said he was respectful. Maybe he could have been more empathetic, but the key is he didn't act maliciously. The friends' behavior and Amy's mental health are their own issues. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
