I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call him \"John\" for clarity, rejected a girl named Amy who approached him with feelings. Amy later confronted him with friends, claiming she's struggling with depression and suicide thoughts, and John responded by saying he wasn't interested but wished her the best. Now, the question is whether John is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. John initially rejected Amy respectfully when she first approached. Then, later, Amy comes back with friends, and they're putting pressure on him by bringing up her mental health. John's response was to say he's not interested but to offer good wishes. The friends are being confrontational, using terms like \"shit head\" and \"asshole,\" which might be adding to the tension.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect in the rejection. John didn't force Amy to like him, and he was clear about not being interested. However, when Amy escalated the situation by involving friends and mentioning her mental state, maybe John could have handled it differently. But was he wrong in his response? \n\nOn one hand, John had the right to decline her advances without being obligated to pursue a relationship. On the other, when someone is in a vulnerable state, the way you reject them should be as compassionate as possible. The friends might have used Amy's mental health as a manipulative tactic to guilt-triple John into changing his mind. John's response was direct, but perhaps passive-aggressive, as he noted. However, he did express sympathy for her situation, which is good.\n\nBut was he in the wrong? Well, he didn't act in a way that harmed Amy or disregard her mental health. He was honest and tried to be respectful. The friends' reactions might have been more aggressive than justified. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's a nuance where he could have been more empathetic. However, the primary responsibility for the confrontation lies with Amy and her friends, not John.\n"
