I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about rejecting a girl who later approached with friends and accused him of contributing to her suicidal thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy, let's call him the author, was approached by Amy who expressed interest. He turned her down politely. Then, later, Amy comes with friends who are confronting him about her depression and suicide thoughts. He responds by apologizing and stating he's not interested again. The friends leave upset, calling him names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the main factors here are: did he have a duty to respond differently when confronted with her emotional state? Was his rejection the cause of her issues? And how should one handle such situations.\n\nRejecting someone can be hard, especially if the person is emotionally vulnerable. The author tried to be respectful but maybe could have been more empathetic. However, he was clear and apologized. The friends are acting as if he's responsible for her feelings, which might be a stretch. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). \n\nPossible angles: The author might not be in the wrong because he was honest. But maybe he could have been more considerate in his response when the friends were confronting him. Also, the friends might be overstepping by using Amy's emotional state as a weapon. \n\nThe author's response was defensive, which might not have helped. However, he did express that he wishes her the best. The key is whether his actions contributed to her suicidal thoughts. Since the friends are saying that, but the author had already rejected her, but not in a cruel way. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider if there's a duty to refer someone to help if they're in crisis. The author didn't offer help, but maybe that's expected? When the friends approached, he could have said more, like encouraging her to seek professional help. But he might not be responsible for that as a non-professional. \n\nThe friends might be trying to guilt-trip him. The author's actions were rejection, which is not a crime. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, the friends are being aggressive and blaming him. The question is whether he is the asshole. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and actions. The author tried to be respectful, was clear, but maybe could have been more compassionate in the second encounter. But the friends' actions were aggressive, so maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). He was honest and tried to be respectful. The friends are overreacting. However, there's a point where he could have been more supportive when the friends confronted him. But overall, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
