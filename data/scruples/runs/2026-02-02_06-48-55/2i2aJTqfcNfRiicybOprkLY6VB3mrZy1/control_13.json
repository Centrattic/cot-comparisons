I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who rejected a girl named Amy, who later approached him again with friends, accusing him of causing her suicide thoughts. The author tried to be respectful when he initially turned her down, but when confronted again, he reasserted his disinterest, which might have come off as passive-aggressive. The friends then insulted him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are consent, respect, and boundaries. When someone expresses interest, it's important to be clear and kind in the rejection. The author did that initially, but maybe could have been more empathetic. However, when Amy and her friends approached him again, he was in a public setting and felt uncomfortable. He maintained his position that he wasn't interested, which is his right. The friends' reactions were hostile, but the author wasn't in the wrong for standing by his decision. \n\nThe question is whether he was obligated to pursue a relationship despite his lack of interest, especially given the emotional weight Amy was carrying. But people have the right to say no, even if someone is struggling. The author didn't act in a malicious way, just firm. The friends' insults don't make him the asshole. He might have handled it better with more empathy, but the core issue is his right to decline. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
