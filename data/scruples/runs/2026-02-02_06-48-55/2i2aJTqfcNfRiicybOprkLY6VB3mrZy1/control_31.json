I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting a girl named Amy who he's not interested in, and then dealing with her friends confronting him about her suicidal thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author tried to reject Amy respectfully initially. Then, when Amy and her friends approached him again, he was defensive. The friends accused him of causing her distress, leading to suicide thoughts. The author apologizes but says he's not interested and leaves, which might have come off as passive-aggressive.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants an answer A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is not responsible for Amy's mental health. He made a clear rejection, which Amy might not have handled well. However, the friends' confrontation is a bit aggressive. The author's response, while maybe passive-aggressive, was still straightforward. He didn't engage with the emotional manipulation from the friends.\n\nBut then again, when someone is in a vulnerable state, it's important to respond with empathy. Even if the author isn't responsible for her mental health, his response could have been more considerate. Maybe acknowledging her feelings more, even if he's not interested. However, the friends were present, which might have made the situation more confrontational.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a duty to respond differently. He wasn't in a relationship, so his rejection is his right. The friends' behavior seems to escalate the conflict. The author's response, while perhaps not the most empathetic, is still within his rights. He's not responsible for Amy's actions beyond his initial rejection. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not the asshole, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation more compassionately.\n"
