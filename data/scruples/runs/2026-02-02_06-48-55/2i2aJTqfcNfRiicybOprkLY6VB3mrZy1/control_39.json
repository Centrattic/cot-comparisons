I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, let's call him John, rejected a girl named Amy who had expressed interest in him. Amy then approached him again with friends, who accused him of causing her suicidal thoughts. John responded by saying he wasn't interested and wished her well, but the friends were upset. The question is whether John is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. John initially rejected Amy respectfully, which he thought was kind. Then, when confronted again, he tried to maintain that stance. Amy's friends brought up her mental health issues during this second encounter. John's response was to apologize for her struggles but reiterate his lack of interest. The friends reacted negatively, calling him names.\n\nNow, the ethical aspects here. John did reject Amy, which is his right. But when she's in a vulnerable state, how does his rejection affect her? Even if he's not the cause, his rejection could contribute to her distress. However, the friends brought up her mental health issues in the presence of Amy, which might be using that as leverage. Amy's friends might be trying to guilt-trip John by revealing her mental state, perhaps to make him feel responsible.\n\nJohn's main mistake was not handling the situation with more compassion. He didn't offer support beyond a polite rejection. Even if he's not interested, acknowledging her pain and offering help or resources might have been better. The fact that he responded in a way that came off as passive-aggressive isn't helpful either. The friends' aggressive behavior doesn't excuse John's response, but it's possible he could have handled it more empathetically.\n\nHowever, John isn't necessarily at fault for not being interested. People have the right to decline romantic interest. The friends' approach seems manipulative by revealing Amy's mental health to pressure him. But Amy's mental health is a real issue. If John had acted in a way that endangered her, he might be at fault, but he didn't. He did express sympathy, albeit briefly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's tricky. John isn't responsible for Amy's mental health issues, but his rejection could have been a trigger. However, Amy's friends used her condition to make him feel guilty. The line between being compassionate and being manipulated is thin here. John's response was direct but not malicious. He wasn't abusive or threatening. He might have handled it better by offering support or suggesting she seek help, but he isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being interested.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. His rejection was honest, and he did express sympathy. The friends' behavior was more problematic in using mental health as a weapon. However, there's room for improvement in his response.\n"
