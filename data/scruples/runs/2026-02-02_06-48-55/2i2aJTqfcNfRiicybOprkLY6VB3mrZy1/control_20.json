I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting a girl named Amy who had confessed her feelings. Amy then approaches him with friends, accusing him of contributing to her suicidal thoughts.\n\nFirst, the author turned down Amy's advances respectfully but wasn't interested. That part seems fair because people have the right to decline romantic interest without guilt. Then, Amy comes back with friends, and they confront him. The author responds by expressing sympathy for her depression but reiterates his lack of interest. The friends react angrily, calling him names. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by rejecting her, and how did he handle the confrontation? The author's response was to apologize for her struggles and state he's not interested. He admits it might have been passive-aggressive but stands by his stance. The girl's friends are adding pressure, suggesting they're using Amy's mental health as a weapon to guilt-trip him.\n\nIs it the author's fault for not wanting to date her? Probably not. Rejecting someone isn't the same as being cruel. The main issue is whether he handled the rejection poorly. He did try to be respectful initially. The second time, even if his tone wasn't perfect, he didn't escalate the situation. The friends' aggressive behavior and use of her mental health to shame him might be the bigger problem here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for rejecting her, and the friends' approach was likely manipulative. The answer should be B (No).\n"
