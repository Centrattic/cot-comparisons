I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl named Amy who approached him, said she liked him, and then later, after he rejected her, she and her friends confronted him about her suicidal thoughts. The person in question tried to be polite but ended up being called an asshole. The writer is questioning if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The author rejected Amy when she showed interest, which is a common situation. However, when confronted by Amy and her friends, he responded with a polite but potentially passive-aggressive message. The key here is whether his response was appropriate given the context of Amy's mental health.\n\nThe author said, \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested...\" which could be seen as dismissive because it acknowledges the problem but doesn't offer support. Even though he's not responsible for her mental health, the confrontation happened in front of her friends, which might have added to the tension. The friends' accusations and Amy's presence could have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nThe author could have handled it better by expressing empathy more genuinely and perhaps offering to connect her with professional help if she was truly in crisis. Rejecting someone's romantic interest is one thing, but dismissing their mental health struggles without support can be harmful. Even if his intentions were good, the way he responded might not have been considerate enough under the circumstances.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for not being interested, the way he responded to the situation, especially given Amy's stated suicidal thoughts, might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he could have shown more compassion and taken steps to ensure Amy was okay instead of just stating he wasn't interested.\n"
