I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting a girl who approached him, especially considering she mentioned being suicidal. The situation is that Amy liked him, he wasn't interested, and then she came back with friends who accused him of making her suicidal. He tried to be polite but ended up being passive-aggressive. The friends called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he did something wrong. The main points here are consent, respecting boundaries, and how he handled the situation. The author clearly stated he wasn't interested, which is his right. He tried to be respectful initially. The second time, Amy's friends confronted him, which might have been aggressive. He responded with an apology and stated his disinterest again, which he admits was passive-aggressive.\n\nThe key here is whether he was responsible for her emotional state. It's important to note that he didn't cause her suicidal thoughts; they preexisted. However, his rejection could have contributed to her distress, but that's not his fault if he was clear and respectful. The friends' behavior was confrontational, which might have escalated things. The author's response was direct, but maybe he could have been more empathetic, even if he wasn't interested. However, he's not obligated to engage further or take responsibility for her actions or reactions beyond his initial rejection.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to not be interested, and while he could have handled the second interaction better, he's not at fault for rejecting someone. The problem lies with Amy's friends and her own mental health issues, not the author.\n"
