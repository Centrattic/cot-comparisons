I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author rejected a girl named Amy, who later approached him again with her friends, claiming she was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. The friends confronted him, and he responded by saying he wasn't interested but wished her the best.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. When someone is dealing with mental health issues, especially suicidal thoughts, it's important to take those seriously. But the author had already rejected Amy's advances, and she might have been using her mental health as a way to manipulate the situation or get a different reaction from him. \n\nThe author's response\u2014saying he's not interested but wishing her the best\u2014is straightforward. He didn't make any threats or act aggressively. However, the friends were there with Amy, so maybe he should have been more concerned about her well-being in the moment, even if he wasn't interested in her romantically. Could his rejection have contributed to her emotional state? That's a tricky part because he might not be responsible for her mental health, but the way he handled the confrontation might have been insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy might have escalated the situation by bringing her friends and using her mental health as a tactic. The friends' aggressive reactions (calling him names) suggest that they were upset, but the author was just trying to be polite and set boundaries. \n\nThe key here is whether the author ignored or dismissed Amy's mental health crisis. He did acknowledge her struggles and offered well-wishes, which is respectful. However, if there was a genuine crisis, he might have been in a position where he should have encouraged her to seek help, even if he wasn't in a relationship with her. But the situation isn't clear on whether Amy was actually in immediate danger. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't necessarily at fault for being honest about his feelings, but maybe he could have handled it more compassionately. However, considering he didn't act in a harmful way and was clear about his position, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But there's room to argue both sides. The friends' reactions might indicate that Amy's mental state was taken as a weapon, which complicates things. Still, the author's actions seem within his right to reject someone, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
