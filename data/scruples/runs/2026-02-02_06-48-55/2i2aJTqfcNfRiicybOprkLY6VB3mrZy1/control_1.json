I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for rejecting a girl he wasn't interested in, even after she mentioned being suicidal. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, let's call him John, was approached by Amy who expressed interest. He politely rejected her. Then, later, Amy and her friends confront him again, mentioning her depression and suicide thoughts. John responds by apologizing for her struggles but reiterates his lack of interest. The friends get angry and leave, calling him names.\n\nSo, the key points here. Amy's mental health is a big factor. The friends mention her depression and suicide thoughts, which adds weight to the situation. John's response was to say he's not interested but wished her the best. He felt defensive and probably didn't handle it as nicely as he could have.\n\nNow, the ethical angle. Is it wrong to be honest about not being interested when someone is in a vulnerable state? On one hand, honesty is important, and people should be allowed to express their feelings without being pressured. On the other hand, when someone is struggling with their mental health, the way you handle the rejection becomes more sensitive. \n\nJohn did apologize for her struggles, which shows some empathy, but the way he delivered the message might have been too abrupt. The friends' reactions suggest that Amy was very hurt, and their presence might have added pressure on John. But does that make him the asshole? \n\nAlso, considering that John was defending himself when confronted by multiple people, he might have felt cornered. But regardless of the setting, if someone is genuinely in crisis, the appropriate response would be to take their mental health seriously and perhaps encourage them to seek help, rather than just stating a lack of interest.\n\nSo, maybe John isn't wrong for not being interested, but he could have handled the conversation more compassionately. The key is whether he was inconsiderate. Since he acknowledged her struggles but didn't offer support beyond that, he might be seen as not fully considering her emotional state. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the friends were using her mental health to guilt-trip him, maybe that's their fault. However, if Amy truly is suicidal, then the situation is more serious. The answer likely depends on whether he was aware of her genuine crisis. If he knew she was suicidal, then he should have directed her to help. But in this case, he was told by her friends. \n\nSo, John might be at fault for not taking more steps to ensure her safety, beyond just saying he's not interested. Even if he's not interested, in a situation where someone might be suicidal, the right action would be to encourage them to seek professional help. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he could have been more supportive despite his lack of interest.\n"
