I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who rejected the girl is in the wrong. The situation is that Amy approached the author, expressed interest, and was rejected. Then, Amy came back with friends, and the friends accused the author of causing her distress due to her depression and suicidal thoughts. The author responded by saying he's not interested but wished her the best.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was clear in his rejection, which the user says he did as respectfully as possible. The friends then confront him in front of Amy, implying he's responsible for her emotional state. He responds again, maintaining his stance but acknowledges her struggles. The user is questioning if he was wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and ethics. Rejecting someone isn't the same as being malicious. However, the context here is that Amy is struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. The friends used that as leverage during the confrontation. The author's responsibility here is a bit tricky. He did reject her, but does that make him responsible for her mental health? Probably not, but maybe he could have followed up to ensure she's okay or offered support beyond the initial rejection. However, the friends' behavior seems confrontational and possibly manipulative, using Amy's mental health to guilt-trip the author.\n\nThe author's response was direct and clear. While it might have come off as passive-aggressive, he did express sympathy for her situation. The key here is whether he crossed a line by rejecting her and then not engaging further. Since he wasn't in a relationship or committed to supporting her, his rejection isn't inherently wrong. The friends' reaction might be an attempt to shift blame onto him, which could be manipulative.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole (AITA), the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering that he was upfront, didn't engage in abusive behavior, and the friends are adding pressure by mentioning suicide, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's room for better handling, like offering support after rejection. But the main question is about being wrong. Since he wasn't cruel and was honest, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The friends might be at fault for using Amy's mental health as leverage.\n"
