I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about rejecting someone who's having suicidal thoughts. The person writing the post (AITA?) is asking if they were the asshole for turning down Amy's advances, especially after she approached them again with friends and made accusations about her depression.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author initially rejected Amy politely, but then she came back with friends, and they confronted the author. The friends were saying that Amy was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, which made the author defensive. The author's response was to apologize but reiterate that they weren't interested, which came off as passive-aggressive.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author was honest about not being interested and tried to be respectful. On the other hand, when dealing with someone who's vulnerable, especially with mental health issues, the approach might need to be more considerate. But the author did express regret about the tone of their response.\n\nBut wait, the friends were there, and Amy was present. The friends might have used her mental health as a ploy to pressure the author. The author's actions were to set a boundary, which is okay. However, the way they handled it could have been better. The key here is whether the author is responsible for Amy's emotional state. While they did reject her, it's not their fault that Amy is having suicidal thoughts. They might not have the capacity to handle that situation, especially when others are involved. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not being interested and for setting a boundary. However, the way they communicated the rejection could have been more empathetic. But since they did express regret and tried to be respectful, maybe they're not the asshole. The friends' actions might have been manipulative, using the suicide mention to guilt-trip the author. The author's response was to maintain their position, which is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
