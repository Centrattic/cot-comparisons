I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author rejected a girl named Amy, who then approached him with friends and accused him of causing her suicidal thoughts. The author apologized but said he wasn't interested and wished her the best.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He initially turned down Amy's advances politely. Then, when confronted by her and her friends, he apologized again but re-emphasized his lack of interest. The friends accused him of being cruel and made derogatory remarks.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author was honest about his feelings, which is important in any interaction. However, when Amy's friends brought up her mental health, the author's response might have been seen as dismissive. Even though he apologized, saying \"I'm not interested\" in the context of someone being suicidal could be insensitive. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nI should check if he had any obligation to pretend to be interested. No, he's allowed to decline. However, when someone is in emotional distress, the response should be more empathetic. The author's reply was passive-aggressive, which could worsen the situation. But was it his fault that Amy or her friends reacted that way? The friends might have escalated things by bringing in mental health without giving Amy a chance to handle it herself. \n\nThe author isn't responsible for Amy's actions, but he could have handled it better. Maybe he should have offered support or suggested talking to a counselor. But he did apologize and say he wasn't interested, which is honest. The friends' reactions don't necessarily make the author the asshole if he didn't provoke them beyond stating his position. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether his response was appropriately empathetic given the context. Since he could have been more supportive, maybe he's partially at fault. But since he wasn't the one making the suicide threats, he's not entirely wrong. It's a tricky situation. The options are A or B. The user wants a yes or no. Considering all, the author might not be in the wrong, but could improve. So answer B.\n"
