I tried to be as respectful as possible but the truth was I just wasn't interested in her, so I let her down easy I thought.\n\nHowever, I don't think she believed the same. On Friday after school, she approaches me again with 2 of her friends by her side, automatically I felt uncomfortable and then the 2 friends started to bombard me with, \"Amy is really struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide at the moment, how could you treat her like that!?\" (DON'T FORGET AMY IS WITH THEM) Feeling defensive, I look at Amy and say \"I'm sorry you're going that but I'm not interested, truly, and I wish you the best.\" I probably could've told her this a bit nicer as it come off as a bit passive aggresive  but whatever. Then they depart with scoffs and a few announcements of \"shit head\" \"jack ass\" and the almighty \"ass hole\".  \n\nI really don't think so but was I the asshole? Or how could I have handled that better? Thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for rejecting a girl who they knew was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. The situation is that a girl named Amy approached him and said she liked him. He wasn't interested and tried to let her down gently. Then later, Amy and her friends confront him again, saying he's treating her badly because she's suicidal. He responds by apologizing for her situation but reiterates he's not interested. The friends walk off, calling him names.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent, emotional state of Amy, and how the author handled the rejection. The author made it clear he wasn't interested, which is his right. However, Amy was in a vulnerable state, which might affect how her actions are perceived. The friends' presence and their accusations might add pressure, but the author's response was to express sympathy and reiterate his lack of interest. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he wasn't physically or verbally abusive. He tried to be respectful. But when someone is in a vulnerable state, the way you handle rejection might matter more. Maybe he could have offered support or suggested she seek help, but he didn't. However, he also has the right to not be in a relationship if he's not interested. The friends might have been using her mental health as a tactic to guilt-trip him. \n\nThe question is whether his refusal, even with a passive-aggressive tone, is wrong given Amy's mental state. Some might argue that ignoring someone's mental health crisis is wrong, but the author didn't know how serious it was. He did say he was sorry and wished her the best. The friends might have exaggerated the situation to get a reaction. So, the author's actions don't seem malicious, but the handling could have been better. However, he's not necessarily in the wrong because he had the right to decline. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
