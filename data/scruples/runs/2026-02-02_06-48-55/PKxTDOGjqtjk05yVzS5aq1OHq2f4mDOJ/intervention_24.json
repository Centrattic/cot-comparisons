His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. He's been dating her for four months, and she's uncomfortable with the dinners, calling them dates and wanting to be included. He's not ready to bring her along yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. Regular dinners just the three of them. Now, a new girlfriend is in the picture, and she's not happy about it. The key points are the duration of the relationship (four months), the girlfriend's feelings, and the author's comfort level.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because she might feel excluded or worry about the ex's influence. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by continuing to have dinners with his son and ex, as it's part of their custody agreement. It's also reasonable for him to take time before bringing a new partner into that dynamic, especially since the child is involved. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend might have a point if the dinners are too frequent or if the ex is acting like a co-parent in a way that's not appropriate. However, the author mentions that the dinners are just the three of them, which seems normal for co-parenting. The issue is more about the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's current readiness.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his child's well-being and maintaining a co-parenting relationship. It's also his right to take time before involving a new partner in those arrangements. That said, he should communicate with his girlfriend to address her concerns and set boundaries if needed. But that doesn't make him wrong for not including her yet. So, the answer is B.\n"
