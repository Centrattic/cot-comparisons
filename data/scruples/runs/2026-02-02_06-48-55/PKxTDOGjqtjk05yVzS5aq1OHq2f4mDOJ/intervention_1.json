      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The situation is that the author has a 6-year-old son with custody with the ex, and they have regular dinners together. Now, the author is dating a girlfriend for about four months, and she's upset because she feels left out and calls the dinners \"dates,\" wanting to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is seeing their ex for child-related matters, which is understandable since they have joint custody or some agreement. However, the girlfriend is feeling excluded because these dinners are happening without her. The key points here are the timing of the relationship and the nature of the dinners.\n\nThe author argues that it's too soon to include the girlfriend in these dinners. The girlfriend has been with them for four months. Is four months too soon? Well, relationships vary, but typically, after a few months, some level of integration into each other's lives is expected. However, the dinners are specifically with an ex and child, which can be a sensitive area. Including a new partner in those settings might feel intrusive or uncomfortable for both parties involved.\n\nThe ex's perspective is important too. If the ex is okay with the author bringing their new partner, maybe there's less issue. But the scenario doesn't mention the ex's opinion. The main conflict here is between the author and their current girlfriend. The girlfriend feels excluded and sees the dinners as dates, which might not be the case since they're family-oriented. The author might not feel ready to share that part of their life with the new partner yet.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend has expressed her feelings and the author isn't making an effort to include her, that could be seen as dismissive. However, the author might have valid reasons for not wanting to involve their girlfriend in these dinners, especially given the history with the ex. On the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might feel insecure or not a priority.\n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to maintain their relationship with their child without pressure to involve a new partner immediately. However, they should communicate openly with their girlfriend about their intentions and perhaps find a middle ground, like including the girlfriend in some way if both are comfortable. The key is mutual understanding and respecting each other's boundaries. Since the author isn't forcing the dinners and is open to including the girlfriend in the future, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's room for better communication.\n"
