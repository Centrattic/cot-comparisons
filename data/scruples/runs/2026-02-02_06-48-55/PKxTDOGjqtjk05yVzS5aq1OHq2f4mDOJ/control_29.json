His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy has a 6-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have regular dinners. The girlfriend is upset because she's not included and calls these dinners \"dates,\" which might be a misunderstanding. The author says he's not comfortable including her yet but if they last long-term, he might.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the ex is the parent, so she has a right to custody and time with the son. The dinners are between parent and child, which is a family matter. The girlfriend is his current partner, but four months isn't that long. Expecting to be included in family dinners so soon might be too much. However, communication is key here. The author should probably explain that these are family dinners, not dates, to avoid misunderstandings. But the main issue is whether it's wrong to not include the girlfriend. Since the ex is the parent, and the author isn't doing anything wrong by spending time with his son, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable. So answer B.\n"
