      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a six-year-old son, and the ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. He sees his son regularly, including dinners three times a week. Now he's in a four-month relationship, and his girlfriend is upset that she's not included in these dinners. The author isn't ready to include her yet, thinking it's too soon, but he acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, custody is with the ex, but the father has visitation rights. The dinners are part of his parenting time. The girlfriend's issue is about being excluded. The key points here are the timing of the relationship and the nature of the dinners. Since the dinners are between the father, son, and ex, adding a new partner might change the dynamic. The author isn't at fault for maintaining his relationship with his child, which is important. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her unless he's comfortable. Relationships require communication, so maybe the issue is more about communication than right or wrong. The author isn't hurting anyone by not including her yet. The ex isn't the girlfriend's issue; it's about the father's time with his child. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
