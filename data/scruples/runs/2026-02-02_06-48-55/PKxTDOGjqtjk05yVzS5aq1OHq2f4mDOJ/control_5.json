We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have dinners together, sometimes weekly or every other week. Now, he's been dating his current girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, thinking they're dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't ready for that yet.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not including his girlfriend in these dinners. The key points here are the dynamics between the author, his ex, and his girlfriend. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is spending time with his child and his ex, which is a common and reasonable arrangement post-divorce. The ex has custody, so the author's involvement is appropriate. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling excluded or insecure. However, the author's hesitation makes sense given the relationship is only four months old. Including a new partner in family dinners might be too soon for both parties.\n\nThe main factors here are consent and communication. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with his son. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's actions are within his rights. The issue might be more about communication between the couple rather than the author being wrong. If the girlfriend wants to be included, it's up to the author to decide when he's comfortable with that, especially since it's about his family time with the child.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's fulfilling his parental role, and the girlfriend's feelings, while important, don't make him wrong. The responsibility here is more on both to communicate and find a middle ground, but the author isn't at fault for not including her yet.\n"
