His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who has dinners with his ex and their son, and his current girlfriend is upset that she's not included. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man is seeing his son, which is part of his custody arrangement. The ex allows him to see the son regularly, and they have a good relationship. The dinners are for the son, not a date between the man and his ex. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is new\u2014only four months in\u2014and is upset because she wants to be included in these outings.\n\nThe key points here are the man's right to spend time with his child and the girlfriend's feelings. The man isn't doing anything illegal by seeing his son, and the ex isn't involved in a romantic sense anymore. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling excluded or insecure, which is a common issue in new relationships. The man is being honest about not wanting to include his girlfriend yet, which is his prerogative. \n\nHowever, communication is important. The man should explain the situation to his girlfriend to alleviate her concerns. But that doesn't mean he's in the wrong for not including her. The dinners are family time, not a social event where the girlfriend must be present. Unless the girlfriend is part of the child's life, which she isn't mentioned as being, it's reasonable for him to keep things as they are.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. He's maintaining a relationship with his child, which is appropriate, and the girlfriend's feelings are valid but not a reason to fault him.\n"
