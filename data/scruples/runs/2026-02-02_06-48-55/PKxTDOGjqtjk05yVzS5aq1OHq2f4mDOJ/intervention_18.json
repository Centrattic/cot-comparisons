It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a 6-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have a good relationship and have scheduled dinners every week or every other week. Now, he's been dating his current girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, feeling they're like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't ready to include her yet but understands her feelings.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: \n- The author's relationship with his ex is for his son's benefit, which is a parental duty. \n- The girlfriend's feelings about being excluded after four months. \n- The author's stance that it's too soon to include her in family dinners.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's maintaining a relationship with his son, which is important. The ex is the custodial parent, so the dinners are about co-parenting. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or wanting to be part of his life more. However, four months into a relationship, especially with a young child, including the girlfriend in family dinners might be a big step. It's common for people to take time to integrate partners into their family lives, especially if the relationship is still new.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel left out or insecure about the ex's role. Communication between them is key. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing his son's needs, but he should address her concerns and set boundaries to make her feel included in other ways. \n\nThe ex is not part of the current relationship, so the dinners are for the child. The author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in co-parenting activities. However, if the girlfriend is feeling neglected, they need to talk about how to balance both their needs. The author isn't in the wrong for not involving her in these specific dinners, especially since it's for the son. But he should be sensitive to her feelings and communicate openly.\n"
