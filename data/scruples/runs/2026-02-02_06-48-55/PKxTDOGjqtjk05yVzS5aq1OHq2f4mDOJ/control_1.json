      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person has a son with their ex, and they have dinners with the ex and the son. Now they're dating someone new for four months, and the girlfriend doesn't like that they're having these dinners without her. The author says they don't feel comfortable including the girlfriend yet but understand her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is seeing their son, which is a parent's right and responsibility. The ex has custody, so the author's involvement is appropriate. The dinners are just the three of them, which seems normal for a parent-child relationship. The new girlfriend is upset because she feels left out, but the author thinks it's too soon to include her. \n\nIs the author wrong for not involving the girlfriend? Well, the author's priority is their child, and it's reasonable to maintain a relationship with the ex for the child's sake. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but the author is being honest about their feelings. The key here is communication. The author hasn't excluded the girlfriend maliciously; they just think it's too soon. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Maybe the author should talk to her more about why they're not ready, but does that make them wrong? \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can see the son if they give notice, so they're already respecting the ex's custody. The dinners are about the child, not a romantic relationship with the ex. So the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining that bond. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, but the author isn't in the wrong for not including her yet. It's about setting boundaries and being honest. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
