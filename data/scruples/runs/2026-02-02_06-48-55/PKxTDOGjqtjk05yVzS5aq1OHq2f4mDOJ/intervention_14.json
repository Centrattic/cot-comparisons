      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The guy is in a new relationship, four months in. He has a son with his ex, who has custody. They already have weekly or biweekly dinners together, which the ex is okay with as long as he gives notice. Now, the new girlfriend is upset because she thinks these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges that if the relationship works out, maybe in the future.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not including the girlfriend in these dinners. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author has an existing relationship with his son and ex, and the ex is agreeable to his presence. The dinners are likely about the child, not romantic, so it's a custodial arrangement. The author might not feel it's fair to drag the girlfriend into family time, especially if it's not a couple's event.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel left out or insecure. She's in a new relationship and might want to be integrated into his life, including his role as a father. The author's refusal could make her feel like he's not prioritizing her in his life yet, which is a common concern in new relationships where both partners are trying to adjust.\n\nBut here's the thing: the dinners are with his son, not with the ex as a romantic partner. So it's more about family time. The ex is just the custodial parent. The author's girlfriend might have a right to feel included, but the author's hesitation is also valid because he's not ready to involve his girlfriend in parenting his child. It's a sensitive area because the girlfriend isn't part of the child's existing family structure. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, communication is key. The author should discuss his feelings with the girlfriend to set boundaries and expectations. However, the dinners themselves aren't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong unless he's being dismissive of her feelings. Since he acknowledges her apprehension and is open to long-term inclusion, he's showing some consideration.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B). The situation is complex, but his actions are within his rights, especially considering the child's welfare and existing arrangements. The key is that the dinners aren't \"dates\" as the ex is the child's mother, and the author isn't doing anything to interfere with the new relationship's dynamics. He's just maintaining his parental responsibilities.\n"
