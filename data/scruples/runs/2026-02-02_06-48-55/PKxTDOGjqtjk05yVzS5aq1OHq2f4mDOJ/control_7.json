      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. They've been dating for four months, and the girlfriend is upset because she considers the dinners as dates and wants to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The son is six, and the father has custody, so the ex is the mother. They have regular dinners as a way to maintain a relationship with the child. The current girlfriend feels left out and wants to be part of these dinners. The author isn't comfortable with that yet because they're still in the early stages of the relationship.\n\nI should think about boundaries. When you're in a new relationship, especially when you have children from a previous one, there's a need to balance old and new relationships. The ex is the mother, so the dinners are about the child's well-being. Including the new girlfriend might complicate things, especially if the ex isn't happy about it. The author might be right in not wanting to rush into involving the new partner too soon.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important too. She might feel insecure or not prioritized. It's valid for her to express her feelings. However, the father has a right to maintain his relationship with his child, which is crucial. The key here is communication. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to include the girlfriend yet, but they might need to have a conversation about expectations and how to move forward without making the girlfriend feel excluded.\n\nAlso, considering the child's needs, consistency and stability are important. Changing the dynamics of the dinners might affect the child. The author is maintaining a good relationship with his son, which is essential. The girlfriend's discomfort is a red flag that needs addressing, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not including her yet.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They need to communicate with their girlfriend about their boundaries and the importance of the dinners for their son, but they aren't at fault for not including her yet.\n"
