      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have dinners together once a week or every other week. The ex has custody, but they have a good co-parenting relationship. Now, the author is dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she's not included in those dinners. She calls them dates and wants to be part of them, but the author isn't comfortable yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider co-parenting norms. Typically, when parents are separated, it's common for the non-custodial parent to spend time with their child. The dinners are just the parent and child, which is standard. Including a new partner might not always be necessary, especially if they're in the early stages of a relationship. The girlfriend's request to be included might stem from feeling insecure or wanting to be part of the child's life, which is understandable but maybe not reasonable at this point.\n\nThe author's discomfort with including the girlfriend now makes sense because adding a new person into a regular family activity could complicate things. The child is six, and sudden changes might affect him. Also, the ex might not want the new partner around the child yet, but the author mentions that they have a good relationship, so maybe they've discussed this.\n\nThe key points are the timing and mutual respect. The girlfriend might feel left out, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining the existing routine. It's about boundaries and not rushing into including a new partner in co-parenting arrangements. The author isn't hiding anything; he's just not ready. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for not including her yet. They need to communicate and find a middle ground, but the author isn't at fault for not including her immediately. So the answer should be B.\n"
