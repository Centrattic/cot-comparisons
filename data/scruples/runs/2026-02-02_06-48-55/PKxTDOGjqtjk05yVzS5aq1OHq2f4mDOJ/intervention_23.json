      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have weekly or every other week dinners just the three of them. The current girlfriend, who he's been dating for four months, doesn't like this and thinks these dinners are dates. She wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and the timeline of the relationship. The author is in a relatively new relationship (four months), and his girlfriend feels excluded. But the dinners are with his ex and their son. The son's mother has custody, so it's important for the father to maintain a relationship with his child. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: she might feel insecure or see the dinners as the author still being emotionally tied to his ex. On the other hand, the author might be prioritizing his child's well-being and maintaining a bond with his son, which is important. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's doing what's necessary for his child. But the girlfriend's feelings matter too. The issue here is communication. The author might not have explained the situation clearly to his girlfriend, leading to misunderstandings. If the girlfriend is calling these dinners \"dates,\" that's a miscommunication. The author should clarify that it's about his child, not a date with the ex. \n\nBut the author isn't wrong for wanting to spend time with his son. However, not involving the girlfriend and dismissing her feelings (\"She calls them dates. She wants to be included, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.\") might be a problem. The author might need to address her concerns more directly, explain the importance of those dinners, and maybe find a way to include the girlfriend if he's open to it, but not feel pressured to include her if it's not appropriate. \n\nWait, but the dinners are only with the ex and the son. Including a new girlfriend in those might not be necessary. However, the girlfriend might feel left out if she's not part of the author's life in other ways. The author should communicate why those dinners are important and ensure his girlfriend understands that it's about the child. If he's not being clear, that's where he might be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's boundaries with his child, that's on her. But the question is about the author. So, if the author is being honest about his intentions and the necessity of those dinners, he's not in the wrong. If he's being deceptive or not addressing her concerns, then maybe he is. The scenario mentions he acknowledges her apprehension, which is a good step. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No). The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain a relationship with his son. The girlfriend needs to understand that. However, communication is key. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to include her yet in those specific dinners. It's a parenting matter, not a romantic one. So the answer is B.\n"
