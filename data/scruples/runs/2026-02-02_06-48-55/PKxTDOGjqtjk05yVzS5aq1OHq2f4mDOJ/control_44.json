      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The situation involves a six-year-old son with the mother having custody, and the author sees him regularly. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and son. The girlfriend is upset about this, calling it dates and wanting to be included, but the author feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has a custody arrangement where they can see their son as long as they give notice. The dinners are just the three of them. The girlfriend is new (four months), and the author isn't comfortable including her yet. The girlfriend is upset and feels excluded.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In many cases, when a person co-parents with an ex, it's common to have such interactions. The ex is a parent, so the dinners are likely about the child's well-being. The girlfriend's complaint is that she feels left out, but the author is prioritizing the child's needs and existing family dynamics.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings are valid in that she might feel insecure or not prioritized. However, the author isn't doing anything illegal or violating the custody agreement. The dinners are necessary for the child's upbringing. The author's stance is that it's too soon, which is a reasonable position in a new relationship. Trust and comfort take time.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't wrong for maintaining a relationship with their child. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations about how quickly to integrate into the existing family structure. On the other hand, if the girlfriend feels her partner is being unfair or not making her feel included in important aspects of his life, that's a relationship issue to discuss. But the author isn't doing anything unethical or against the law here. The dinners are about the child, not a romantic date. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
