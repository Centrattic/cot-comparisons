      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves him having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. He sees his son for dinners a few times a month, depending on schedules. He's been dating his current girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, thinking they're dates and wants to be included. He's not ready for that yet, but he acknowledges her feelings.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, since the ex has custody, he's within his rights to have visitation unless there's a court order against it. The dinners are with his child, which is a parental responsibility and a normal part of co-parenting. The ex is just the other parent, so including her isn't necessarily required unless specified. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is not a parent. Four months into a relationship is a short time, and it's common for people to not want to include a new partner in family dynamics right away, especially with a child involved. The girlfriend's desire to be included might be valid, but the man has the right to set boundaries, especially since it's his time with his child. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel excluded, but that's her issue to work through. The man isn't obligated to involve her in his parenting time unless they're in a more committed stage. There's also the aspect of communication. He's not ignoring her feelings, he's acknowledging them. So, ethically, he's not in the wrong. It's about balancing co-parenting responsibilities with a new relationship. The main issue is the girlfriend's expectations versus his boundaries. Since he's not violating any legal or ethical standards here, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
