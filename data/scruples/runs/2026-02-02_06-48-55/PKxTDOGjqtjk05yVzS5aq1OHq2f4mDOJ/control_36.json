She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: He's in a four-month relationship. His ex has custody of their six-year-old son, and they have a good relationship with regular contact. The dinners are just the three of them, as agreed. The girlfriend is upset, calling them dates and wanting to be included. The author feels it's too soon and isn't comfortable including her yet.\n\nSo, the key points here. The ex has custody, so the ex has primary care. The author's time with the son is part of custody arrangements. The girlfriend is his current partner, but the relationship is still new. The ex is involved because of the child, not romantically.\n\nThe girlfriend's issue is that she sees these dinners as dates and wants to be included. But the dinners are for the child's benefit. It's common for co-parents to spend time with the child together, especially when the child is young. Including the new girlfriend in such arrangements could be seen as adding another person into a necessary dynamic.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel left out or insecure. But the author's right to maintain his relationship with his son is important. The ex's role as a parent is separate from the author's romantic relationships. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault here. He's prioritizing his child's needs and maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship. The girlfriend needs to adjust her expectations about being included in these family dinners. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
