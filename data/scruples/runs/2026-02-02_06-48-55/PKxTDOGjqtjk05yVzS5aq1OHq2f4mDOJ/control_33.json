      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The situation is that the author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners just the three of them. Now, the author is dating someone new for four months, and the girlfriend is upset, thinking these dinners are dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but is open to including her if they stay together long-term.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the dynamics between the author, his ex, his son, and his current girlfriend. The author's intention with the dinners is to spend time with his son, which is a parental responsibility. The ex is the custodial parent, so the author's involvement is appropriate. The girlfriend's main issue is feeling excluded and perceiving the dinners as dates, which might stem from insecurity or a desire to be involved in the author's family life.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his relationship with his son, which is healthy. However, the girlfriend might be feeling neglected or threatened. The author's stance is that it's too soon to include her, which could be valid because four months is a relatively short time in a relationship. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might want to be part of his family life earlier. \n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't in a legal or moral wrong by not involving the girlfriend in these dinners. The dinners are about the child's well-being, and the ex's role as the custodial parent is separate from the new relationship. The girlfriend's discomfort might be more about her own feelings rather than the author's actions. However, the author should communicate clearly with his girlfriend to address her concerns and set boundaries that respect both his needs and hers.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical or illegal. The girlfriend's feelings are a matter of personal sensitivity, but the author isn't at fault for maintaining his relationship with his son. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
