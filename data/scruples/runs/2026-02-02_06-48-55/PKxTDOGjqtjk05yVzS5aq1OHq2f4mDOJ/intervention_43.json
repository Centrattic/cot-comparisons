His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author is dating their girlfriend for four months, and she's not happy about the dinners with the ex. The author says they understand her apprehension but isn't comfortable involving her yet.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here. The author is co-parenting with their ex, which is reasonable and necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out. The author isn't ready to include her in those dinners yet.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is wrong. Well, the dinners are for the child, so the ex is involved as a parent. The girlfriend is not part of that parent-child relationship. The author might be justified in not involving the girlfriend yet, especially since the relationship is only four months old. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected, but the author's priority is maintaining a good co-parenting relationship and the child's needs.\n\nIs there a cultural or social norm that suggests partners should be included in such family dinners? Maybe, but the context is co-parenting, which is different from a romantic partner. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate by spending time with their child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't excluding her from something they're supposed to be sharing. So maybe the author is not in the wrong here. The answer might be B, No. But I should check if there's anything else. Like, maybe the author should communicate better with the girlfriend about their expectations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not including her. Since the dinners are with the ex as a parent, and the girlfriend isn't part of that dynamic, the author isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
