      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a 6-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have dinners together weekly or every other week when possible. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she wants to be included in these dinners. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. The dinners are between the father, his ex, and his son. The ex has custody, so the father's involvement is appropriate for co-parenting. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels left out. The author isn't ready to include her yet, which is within his rights since it's his son and his ex's arrangement.\n\nFrom a co-parenting standpoint, the author is fulfilling his role as a father. The girlfriend is not part of the custody agreement, so her expectation to be included might be unreasonable. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid in that she might feel insecure or left out in the relationship. That doesn't necessarily make the author wrong, though.\n\nThe author's concern is that the girlfriend is calling the dinners \"dates,\" which could be a misinterpretation. The dinners are co-parenting time, not a date. The author's hesitation to include the girlfriend is because the relationship is still new. It's important to respect boundaries here. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his child's well-being and maintaining a co-parenting relationship.\n\nPotential issues: If the dinners were happening in a way that made the ex uncomfortable, that could be a problem, but the post doesn't mention that. The main conflict is between the author and his girlfriend. Since the author is maintaining a relationship with his son as per custody agreements, he's not violating any rules. The girlfriend's discomfort is part of the relationship dynamics, but the author isn't in the wrong for continuing his co-parenting activities.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's maintaining his parental responsibilities, and the girlfriend's expectations might need adjustment.\n"
