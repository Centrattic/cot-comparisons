His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is seeing his son, which he has a good relationship with, and the ex allows it as long as he gives notice. They have weekly or biweekly dinners as a parent and child. The girlfriend is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to spend time with his child, which is a fundamental parental right. The ex isn't involved as a partner anymore, so the dinners are family-related. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from feeling excluded, but is that the author's fault? \n\nOn the other hand, in a new relationship, communication is key. The author isn't including the girlfriend, which could be seen as not being transparent. However, the author is clear that he's not ready to involve her in those family dinners yet. It's about boundaries and how relationships develop over time. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be a bit possessive, expecting inclusion in family matters early on. The author's stance is that it's too soon, which is a common sentiment in new relationships. But maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns about feeling left out. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his relationship with his child. \n\nI think the key point here is the nature of the dinners. They are parent-child time, not dates between exes. The girlfriend's expectation to be included might be unreasonable, especially if she's not a co-parent. The author isn't at fault for wanting to keep those dinners separate from his current relationship. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
