We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners together, which the ex arranges. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she feels left out of these dinners.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline of the relationship and the girlfriend's feelings. Four months into a relationship, it's still early. The author's girlfriend is asking to be included in family dinners, which is a reasonable request. However, the author isn't comfortable with that yet. The question is whether excluding the girlfriend is wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend feels left out, which can lead to insecurity. The author might be justified in taking time to adjust, as blending a new partner into family dynamics can be complex. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The author might not be in the wrong if he's being honest and respectful, but he should consider discussing it openly with his girlfriend to address her concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's discomfort is significant, the author's refusal to include her might be seen as dismissive. But considering the short time they've been together, it's not unreasonable for the author to take a gradual approach. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author is communicating his reasons effectively. If he's respectful and explains his stance, he's not in the wrong. If he's being dismissive, then he might be. Based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
