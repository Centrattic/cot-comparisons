      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a six-year-old son and an ex who has custody. They have a good relationship and can see their son whenever they coordinate schedules. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and the son. Now, the author is in a new relationship, four months in, and their current girlfriend is upset that she's not included in these dinners. The author thinks it's too soon to involve her in these family dinners but acknowledges the girlfriend's apprehension.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: having regular dinners with their son and ex. Since the ex has custody and they have a good relationship, it makes sense that the author is maintaining that connection for their son's well-being. It's important for the child to have both parents involved, and the author is fulfilling that role.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: she's uncomfortable with the dinners and feels left out. She's been in the relationship for four months, which is a relatively short time. It's not uncommon for new partners to feel insecure or concerned about ex-partner dynamics, especially when children are involved. However, the author is not doing anything wrong by continuing to spend time with their child. The key here is whether the author is being transparent and respectful of their current girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe author is being honest about their intentions and the importance of these dinners. They mention that if the relationship works out long-term, they would include the girlfriend. That shows they are considering the future but are not ready to make a change now. The girlfriend might feel that her feelings are not being prioritized, but the author isn't violating any rules unless there's an explicit agreement otherwise.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're maintaining a necessary relationship with their child and ex, which is reasonable. However, they might need to better address the girlfriend's feelings. Maybe the girlfriend feels excluded, but the author isn't doing anything unethical or harmful. The issue is more about the girlfriend's comfort level in a new relationship. Since the author isn't keeping the dinners a secret and is open about their commitment to their child, it's more about communication and mutual understanding rather than wrongdoing. So, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
