      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with their ex and son without including the current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have regular dinners as a three. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and calls them dates, wanting to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's ex has custody, so the author's time with the son is probably arranged and necessary. The ex is the child's mother, so the dinners are likely part of maintaining a healthy relationship with the child. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is a new partner in a four-month relationship. She's not the parent, so her expectations about inclusion might be different from the ex's.\n\nThe key points are: the dinners are with the ex and son, not a new partner. The author isn't making a new relationship with the ex; it's about co-parenting. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from jealousy or insecurity, but the author is in a position where they have to prioritize their parental responsibilities. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is maintaining a necessary relationship with their child. The girlfriend's request to be included might be a reasonable desire for inclusion, but the author is not obligated to include their partner in family dinners, especially given the recent duration of the relationship. The author might need to communicate better with the girlfriend to explain the context of the dinners, but the act itself isn't wrong. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If the author is completely dismissive, that could be problematic. But since the author is open to including the girlfriend in the future if the relationship works out long-term, that shows consideration. The main issue is whether excluding the girlfriend is wrong. Given the circumstances, the answer is likely B (No), because the author isn't doing anything unethical; they're fulfilling parental duties. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author isn't in the wrong for not including her yet.\n"
