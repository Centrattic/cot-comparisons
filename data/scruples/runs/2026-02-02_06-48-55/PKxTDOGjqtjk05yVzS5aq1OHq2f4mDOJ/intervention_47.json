      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend. The author's son is six, and they have a good relationship with the ex, allowing visits as long as notice is given. They have weekly or bi-weekly dinners with the ex and the kid. The girlfriend is upset because she considers these dinners as dates and wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the parent of the child, so their relationship with their child is a primary responsibility. The dinners are with the child and the ex, which is a common arrangement in co-parenting situations. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is a new partner, and the author might be prioritizing their parental duties. \n\nThe girlfriend's discomfort is understandable because she's the current partner, and not being included might make her feel insecure or neglected. However, the author's hesitation to include her in family dinners could be due to wanting to maintain a boundary between their partner and child, which is important for the child's well-being. If the girlfriend is expecting to be part of these family dinners right away, that might be unrealistic. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. The author should communicate their stance clearly and reassure the girlfriend that the relationship is important, but also explain the necessity of maintaining the child's routine with the ex. The key here is communication. If the author hasn't been clear about their expectations, that's a problem. However, the author isn't wrong for not including the girlfriend in family dinners, especially since the girlfriend is not the child's parent. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is feeling excluded and the author isn't making efforts to involve her in other ways, that could be an issue. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in those specific dinners. Since the dinners are with the child and the ex, it's not necessarily wrong for the author not to include the current partner. However, the author should be mindful of the girlfriend's feelings and ensure that their relationship is being nurtured in other ways. \n\nI think it's a balance between respecting the child's relationship with the author and the ex, and respecting the new partner's feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in the dinners, but they should be communicative and maybe find other ways to include the girlfriend to maintain their relationship's health. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
