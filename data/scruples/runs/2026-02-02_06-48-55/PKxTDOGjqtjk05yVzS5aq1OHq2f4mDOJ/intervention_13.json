We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having dinners with his ex and their son without including his current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset and wants to be included, but the author feels it's too soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a six-year-old son and an ex with custody. They have regular family dinners, which is probably important for the child's well-being. The current girlfriend is four months into the relationship and feels left out. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author's dinners with the ex and son are for the child's benefit and maintaining a healthy relationship with him, which is understandable and necessary.\n2. The girlfriend's feelings about being excluded. It's natural for someone in a new relationship to feel insecure, but the author's actions are about maintaining a family connection, not dating the ex.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything inappropriate by spending time with his son. The girlfriend's request to be included might stem from insecurity rather than a valid concern. However, communication is key. The author could be more transparent about the nature of these dinners to reassure his girlfriend. \n\nBut is the author actually wrong? The dinners are for the child, not a romantic date. The author isn't hiding anything or being unfaithful. The girlfriend's discomfort is her issue to address. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
