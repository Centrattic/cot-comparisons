      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a six-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have a good relationship and regular dinners with just the three of them. Now, they're dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she wants to be included in those dinners. The person isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the established routine with the ex and child, the girlfriend's feelings, and the person's own comfort level. The dinners are between the parent, ex, and child. The girlfriend is new and wants to be part of that. But the person doesn't feel ready for that step.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, maintaining a relationship with their child is important, especially when the ex is cooperative. The dinners are probably part of the child's routine and bonding time. Adding a new parent figure into that might disrupt that dynamic. The boy is only six, so including a new adult could be confusing or stressful for him.\n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel excluded or not trusted. But the person has a right to set boundaries, especially in a new relationship. Four months is a short time, and expecting to change established family routines so quickly might be unrealistic. The person is being honest about their feelings, which is good.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They're not ignoring the girlfriend's feelings but explaining their position. They're maintaining a necessary relationship with their child and ex. Unless the girlfriend is a legal guardian or has a claim to those dinners, which isn't stated, the person isn't doing something wrong. They're balancing their responsibilities as a parent with their new relationship. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
