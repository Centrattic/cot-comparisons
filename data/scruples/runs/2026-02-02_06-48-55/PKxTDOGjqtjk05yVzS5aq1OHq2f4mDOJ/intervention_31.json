His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has dinners with their ex and son, and the current girlfriend doesn't like it. The girlfriend wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so their relationship with their child is important. The ex has custody, but the father is maintaining a good relationship with the son, which is generally seen as positive. The dinners are for the child's well-being, right? The ex is part of the equation because of the custody arrangement.\n\nNow, the current girlfriend is dating the author for four months. She's uncomfortable with the dinners and wants to be included. The author feels it's too soon, which is a common perspective. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid here. She might feel insecure or like she's not as important. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by seeing their child. However, the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered. If the author isn't including the girlfriend, maybe they should discuss it to find a middle ground. But is the author wrong for not including her yet?\n\nWait, the author isn't the one making the dinners exclusive. The ex is part of the arrangement because it's the custody situation. The author is prioritizing their child's needs. The girlfriend's issue is more about social inclusion rather than the child's well-being. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend feels left out because the author is spending time with their ex. That could lead to jealousy. The author might need to address the girlfriend's concerns by explaining the reasons behind the dinners and setting boundaries if needed. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not including the girlfriend in family dinners. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is maintaining a relationship with their child, which is important, and the girlfriend's feelings are valid but not the author's fault. The problem is more about communication between the couple rather than the author being wrong.\n"
