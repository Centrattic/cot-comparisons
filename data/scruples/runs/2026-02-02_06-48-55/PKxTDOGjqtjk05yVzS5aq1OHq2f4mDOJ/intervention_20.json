We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.

It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about this because she feels excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship. The dinners are for the child, which is a common and reasonable thing for a parent to do. The girlfriend, however, doesn't like that the author is doing this and wants to be included. The author thinks it's too soon for that, but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being and the dynamics of the current relationship. The author isn't doing anything illegal or morally wrong by spending time with their child. It's a parent's responsibility to maintain a relationship with their child regardless of their romantic status. The girlfriend's desire to be included is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to involve their partner in every aspect of their life, especially when it's about their child. \n\nHowever, there's a communication issue here. The author should have discussed this with their girlfriend to manage expectations. The girlfriend's feeling of exclusion might stem from insecurity or a desire to be part of the family unit, which is valid. But the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's relationship. The problem might be more about how the situation is handled rather than the act itself. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. The author could be doing more to explain their perspective and reassure their girlfriend. However, the act of having dinners with the ex and child isn't inherently wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's discomfort, which is a relational problem rather than a moral one. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
