We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a six-year-old son with whom he has a good relationship. The ex has custody, but they can see each other as long as there's notice. They usually have weekly or biweekly dinners just the three of them. Now, the author has a new girlfriend, four months into the relationship. She's uncomfortable with these dinners and feels they're dates. She wants to be included, but the author isn't ready for that yet. He thinks it's too soon. The ex is okay with this arrangement.\n\nSo, the key points are about boundaries in a new relationship and co-parenting. The author is maintaining a co-parenting dynamic with his ex, which is common and necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's discomfort comes from not feeling included. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nLegally, the author is following the custody agreement. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel insecure, but the author isn't doing anything unethical by spending time with his son. The dinners are about the child, not dates. The author isn't intentionally excluding the girlfriend; he's prioritizing his child's needs and existing co-parenting routine. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and communication is key here. The author might need to explain the situation more clearly to her, but he's not wrong for not including her yet. It's about mutual understanding and respect for both his role as a parent and the new relationship's stage.\n"
