We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son, and the ex has custody but allows him to see the child often. They do weekly or biweekly dinners just the three of them. The girlfriend, who's been dating for four months, is upset and calls these dinners \"dates\" and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but might if they stay together.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about boundaries and communication. The author's ex is the custodial parent, so the child's well-being is important. The dinners are between the ex, the father, and the child, which is a common co-parenting arrangement. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded. But how long have they been dating? Four months isn't very long. Usually, bringing a new partner into family situations takes time and mutual comfort. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with their son. The girlfriend's request to be included might be a bit premature. It's important to consider that co-parenting can be complex, and adding a new person into that dynamic might not be necessary yet. The author's hesitation makes sense because the relationship is new, and involving the girlfriend in these dinners could complicate the child's understanding of the relationships. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel insecure or excluded. The author should communicate clearly with her, explaining the importance of maintaining a stable environment for the child and setting boundaries about when and how the girlfriend can be involved. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the dinners are about co-parenting, not dating. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations about how quickly she can integrate into the author's family life. \n\nSo, the answer would be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their child's relationship with the ex and maintaining co-parenting stability, which is appropriate. The girlfriend needs to respect that unless the author is willing to include her, which they aren't yet. The key here is that the dinners are co-parenting arrangements, not dates, even if the girlfriend perceives them that way. The author's responsibility to their son takes precedence, and the girlfriend's request might be a boundary issue she needs to address.\n"
