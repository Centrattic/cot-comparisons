      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author is a parent with a six-year-old son who has primary custody with the ex. They have a good relationship and meet regularly. The dinners in question are weekly or every other week for just the three of them (the author, ex, and son). Now, the author is dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset about these dinners, perceiving them as dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not including their girlfriend in these family dinners. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the author's right to maintain a relationship with their child, which is a fundamental aspect of parenting. The ex has custody, so the author's involvement is appropriate and necessary for the child's well-being. The dinners are family time, not dating, even though the ex is involved. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In a new relationship, especially with someone who may not be used to the idea of a co-parenting situation, it can be unsettling to see the partner spending regular time with an ex, particularly with the child involved. The girlfriend might feel insecure or worry about the dynamic between the author and the ex, especially if the author is spending time alone with the ex and child. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for maintaining their relationship with their child, but they could be in the wrong if they're not being considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's discomfort is understandable, and the author's response should be to address those concerns rather than dismiss them. However, the author is also within their rights to not include the girlfriend in these dinners if they're not ready. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting the child's needs and the new relationship's dynamics. Since the author isn't planning to exclude the girlfriend from other aspects of their life and is open about the possibility of including her in the future if the relationship progresses, that shows some consideration. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter, and the author's current stance might be causing unnecessary strain on the new relationship. \n\nIn some cases, including the girlfriend in these dinners might help ease her anxiety and show transparency, but the author is not obligated to do so. The question is whether the author is wrong for not including her. Legally and ethically, the author isn't at fault for maintaining a relationship with their child. Emotionally, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to include her yet. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to maintain their parental relationship with their child, and the girlfriend's discomfort is a matter of communication rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
