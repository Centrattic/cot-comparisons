His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a 6-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners, just the three of them. The author is now in a new relationship, and the girlfriend doesn't like this arrangement, calling them dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but is open to it if they stay together long-term.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's visits with the child are part of a custody agreement, and the girlfriend feels left out. The author's reasoning is that it's too soon to involve the girlfriend in those family dinners. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Legally, the author has the right to spend time with his son as per the custody agreement. The ex is the custodial parent, so the author's visits are likely part of a legal arrangement. The dinners are between the father, son, and ex, which might be necessary for the child's well-being. The new girlfriend's discomfort comes from feeling excluded, but the author is not obligated to include her in family matters unless he's comfortable doing so. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication and mutual understanding. The author might need to address the girlfriend's concerns more openly. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the author is following the custody agreement and the dinners are for the child's benefit, he's not necessarily in the wrong. That said, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should consider how to handle this sensitively. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the dinners are part of a custody arrangement and not a date. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author isn't obligated to include her in those specific family gatherings unless both parties agree. The key here is that the author is acting within his rights regarding custody and visiting his child, which isn't a wrongdoing.\n"
