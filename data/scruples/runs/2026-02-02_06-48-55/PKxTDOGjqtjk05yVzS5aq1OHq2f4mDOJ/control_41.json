      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the user is a man who has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. They have dinners together, which is probably common for co-parenting. The ex has custody, but he can see his son whenever with notice. Now, he's dating someone new for four months, and the girlfriend is upset because he's not including her in these dinners. She sees them as dates and wants to be part of them. He feels it's too soon, but he can see her point.\n\nHmm. So, the main issues here are co-parenting dynamics and the new relationship. Let's break it down. Co-parenting usually requires cooperation between ex-partners, especially for the child's well-being. Having dinners with the ex and the child is part of that. The girlfriend's jealousy is understandable, but the man is not in a position where his ex should be involved in his new relationship. Including the girlfriend in these dinners might complicate co-parenting if it causes tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel left out or insecure. But four months into a relationship, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. He's not wrong for not wanting to bring her into family dinners yet. The key here is that the dinners are about the child, not a date. The ex is part of the child's life, so excluding her from the dinners for the child's sake isn't inappropriate. However, the man should communicate with his girlfriend about the situation to manage her expectations. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's fulfilling his parental duties by spending time with his son, which is necessary. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but his actions aren't unethical or wrong. The problem is more about the girlfriend's discomfort, not his actions. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
