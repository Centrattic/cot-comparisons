      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The situation involves a six-year-old son who has custody with the ex, but the father has a good relationship and sees him regularly. They have weekly or biweekly dinners just the three of them. The girlfriend, who they've been dating for four months, doesn't like this and calls them dates, wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with including her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent with custody arrangements, so his time with the child is a parental responsibility. The ex is the mother, so the dinners are likely for the child's benefit. The girlfriend feels left out, which is a common issue in new relationships when there's a history. The key points are the time with the child versus the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for not involving the girlfriend in these dinners? Well, the dinners are with his son and ex. Including a partner in such a family setting can be complicated, especially with a young child. The author feels it's too soon, which is a valid personal boundary. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel insecure or neglected. But the father's primary responsibility is to his child. The dinners are part of his parenting time, which is separate from his romantic relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important too. If she feels excluded, that's a valid feeling, but the author isn't obligated to include her in family time. However, communication is key. The author should explain that the dinners are for the child's well-being and that he's not comfortable bringing the girlfriend into that dynamic yet. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's maintaining his parental responsibilities. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but it's also about respecting the parent's boundaries. The situation might require the couple to discuss and find a middle ground, but the author isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
