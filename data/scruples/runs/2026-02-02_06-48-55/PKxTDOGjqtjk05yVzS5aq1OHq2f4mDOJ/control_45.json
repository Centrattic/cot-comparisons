      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves having regular dinners with their ex and son without including his current girlfriend, who's been dating him for four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a four-month relationship. His ex has custody of their six-year-old son, and they have scheduled dinners together. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and calls these dinners \"dates.\" She wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries in a new relationship. When someone starts a new relationship, especially when they have children from a previous relationship, there are often questions about how to handle existing relationships. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because she might feel insecure or neglected. On the other hand, the author might be justified in wanting to maintain a relationship with his child, which is important.\n\nThe author's ex having custody means that the author still has a connection with his son, which is necessary and appropriate. Having dinners with the ex and child is part of co-parenting. However, the girlfriend's feeling that these dinners are \"dates\" could be a red flag. It's important to clarify that the dinners are for the child's benefit, not a romantic setting. \n\nThe author's hesitation to include the girlfriend might stem from wanting to avoid complicating the situation, especially if the relationship is still new. But the girlfriend's request to be included could be about feeling part of the family unit. The timeline of four months is relatively short, and different people have different comfort levels regarding when to integrate partners into family dynamics.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is violating any norms. Typically, in a new relationship, partners are expected to respect each other's time with family and children. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by maintaining contact with his son. However, the girlfriend has a right to feel included, and the author might need to communicate better about his intentions to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nThe key here is whether the dinners are part of a healthy co-parenting arrangement or if they're being used to maintain a relationship with the ex that could be seen as inappropriate. If the dinners are purely for the child's benefit and not a romantic rendezvous, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's comfort is also important. The answer hinges on whether the situation is respectful and appropriate for the child's well-being while respecting the new partner's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because maintaining a relationship with his child is important and necessary. However, he should be sensitive to his girlfriend's feelings and work towards a compromise that respects both the child's needs and the girlfriend's desire to be included in some capacity, maybe in the future.\n"
