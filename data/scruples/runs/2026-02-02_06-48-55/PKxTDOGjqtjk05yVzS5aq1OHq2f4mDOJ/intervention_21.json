His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have regular dinners. He's been dating his girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she wants to be included. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is maintaining a relationship with his child, which is important. Co-parenting often requires communication and shared time, even if they're separated. The dinners are with his ex and son, which is part of his parenting responsibilities. \n\nNow, the girlfriend being upset because she's not included. Four months into a relationship might be too soon for the girlfriend to expect to be part of these family dinners. The author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical. The ex has custody, so the author's involvement is normal. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel insecure or not respected if she's not included. But the author has a right to maintain his relationship with his child. It's a balancing act between respecting the new partner and not neglecting parental responsibilities. \n\nThe key here is that the author isn't doing anything wrong by the ex's standards if they have an agreement. The girlfriend's discomfort is more about her own insecurities. The author is being honest about not wanting to include her yet, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
