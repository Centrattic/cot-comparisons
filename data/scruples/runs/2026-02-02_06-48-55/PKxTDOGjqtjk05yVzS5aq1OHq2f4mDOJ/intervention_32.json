We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners just the three of them. Now he's dating someone new for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, thinking they're dates and wants to be included. The author isn't ready to include her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nThe key points here are the rights of the ex to custody and the author's right to spend time with his son. The dinners are part of his parenting arrangement, which the ex has agreed to. The new girlfriend is upset about not being included. But is it the author's responsibility to include her in family time?\n\nWell, the dinners are with his child and ex. That's a family matter, not a dating scenario. The girlfriend is not part of the child's legal or custodial situation. Including her in those dinners would require her to be part of the family dynamic, which isn't typical unless she's a step-parent. But they've only been dating four months. It's reasonable for the author to want to maintain the existing relationship with his son and ex without bringing in a new partner so early on.\n\nHowever, communication is important. The girlfriend might feel neglected or insecure because the dinners are frequent. The author might need to discuss boundaries and reassure her that his commitment to the relationship is there, but the dinners are about his child. If he's not including her because he's not ready, that's his choice, but he should make sure she's comfortable with the arrangement. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not doing anything against the law or violating any agreements. The dinners are part of his parenting. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but he's not obligated to include her in family time unless he chooses to. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. The issue is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than right or wrong.\n"
