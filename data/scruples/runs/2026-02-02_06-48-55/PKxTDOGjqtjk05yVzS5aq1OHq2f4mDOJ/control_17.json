      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author has a six-year-old son from a previous relationship. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. The dinners are just the three of them, happening once a week or every other week. The current girlfriend, who's been dating the author for four months, is uncomfortable with these dinners and wants to be included. The author isn't ready for that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so maintaining a relationship with their child is important. The ex is cooperating by allowing these dinners, which suggests there's no conflict there. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels left out or maybe threatened by these regular meetings. The author's stance is that it's too soon to involve the girlfriend in these family dinners.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's feelings matter. It's normal for a partner to want to be included in significant parts of their partner's life, especially when it comes to their children. However, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries, especially given the recent start of the relationship. The ex's approval might also be a factor; if the ex is okay with the dinners, then there's no issue there.\n\nThe main consideration is whether the author is violating any agreements with the ex or the girlfriend. Since the dinners are agreed upon and the ex is on board, the author isn't breaking any custody terms. The girlfriend's desire to be included is about her comfort in the relationship. The author isn't obligated to include her unless there's a mutual agreement. However, being insensitive to her feelings could be a problem. The author recognizes her apprehension, which shows some awareness, but the decision to exclude her is based on personal comfort.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical, but relationship dynamics depend on mutual respect and communication. The author's choice might be causing the girlfriend distress, so the author should address her concerns and find a compromise if possible. However, the decision not to include the girlfriend yet isn't inherently wrong if it's based on the current stage of the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but they should communicate better with their girlfriend to manage expectations and ease her anxieties.\n"
