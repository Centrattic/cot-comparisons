      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship. They have weekly or biweekly dinners with the ex and the child. The girlfriend, who's been dating for four months, doesn't like this and calls them dates, wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not including his girlfriend in these family dinners. Let's consider the factors. \n\nThe dinners are with the ex and child, which are legal and appropriate since the ex has custody and the author has visitation rights. It's common for non-custodial parents to spend time with their children, and including the ex might be part of the child's routine. The girlfriend's request to be included might stem from insecurity or wanting to be part of the family dynamic. However, the author is in a relatively new relationship and isn't ready to involve the girlfriend in family matters yet. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal boundaries and communication. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with his child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but it's also about how the author communicates his stance. If he's respectful and clear about his reasons, it's not necessarily his fault. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations given the newness of the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining his established routine with his child and ex, especially if it's respectful and doesn't undermine the current relationship. However, it's important for both parties to communicate their needs and boundaries.\n"
