      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy has a six-year-old son with his ex, and they have a good relationship. He can see the kid whenever he gives notice, and they have dinners every week or every other week just the three of them. Now he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she feels left out of those dinners. She calls them dates and wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet. He says if they work out long-term, maybe, but it's too soon right now. He acknowledges her apprehension though.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy is co-parenting with his ex, and the kid's mom has custody. The dinners are between him, the ex, and the kid. That's a common arrangement, right? People often have these family dinners with their kids and ex-partners. The new girlfriend is getting uncomfortable because she's not included. \n\nBut the problem here is that the girlfriend is not a parent. The dinners are specifically for the son. Including her would mean bringing someone else into the parent-child dynamic. The author says he's not comfortable yet because it's too soon. He's been dating her four months. That's not a very long time. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that being excluded from these dinners is a sign of not being included in his family life. But on the other hand, the author is prioritizing his relationship with his son and the necessary co-parenting arrangement. The ex is already part of those dinners, so adding another person might complicate things. Also, the son is six, so his needs are more about maintaining a bond with the father rather than socializing with the father's girlfriend.\n\nThe author is being honest about his feelings, acknowledging that it's too soon. He's not trying to hide anything; he's just not ready. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels left out, which is a valid feeling. But is the author wrong for not including her yet?\n\nI think it's about boundaries. The dinners are family-related, not dating. The girlfriend isn't part of the family unit. The author has a right to set boundaries about when and how to introduce his partner to his son. It's reasonable to wait until the relationship is more established. So the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend needs to respect that boundary unless the author is willing to change it. Since he hasn't, he's not wrong for maintaining it.\n"
