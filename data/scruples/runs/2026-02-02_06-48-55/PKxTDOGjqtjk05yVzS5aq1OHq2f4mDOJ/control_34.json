She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a child with their ex, and they have a good relationship. They have dinners with the ex and son regularly. Now, they're dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, seeing them as dates and wanting to be included. The author isn't ready for that yet.\n\nSo, the key points here. The dinners are with the ex and son, which is a common and understandable situation for co-parenting. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling left out or insecure. The author doesn't feel the dinners are dates and isn't ready to include the girlfriend yet.\n\nLegally and socially, co-parenting arrangements often involve the non-custodial parent spending time with the child, sometimes with the ex. It's normal unless there's a history of conflict or abuse, which isn't mentioned here. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or wanting to show commitment by being included. However, the author is within their rights to have these dinners as per custody agreements. The fact that the author is open to including the girlfriend if the relationship works out long-term suggests they're not being intentionally exclusionary or deceitful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a co-parenting standpoint, they're doing what's necessary for the child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in these family dinners. It's about boundaries and communication. The author isn't doing anything unethical or wrong by maintaining their co-parenting relationship. The issue is more about the girlfriend's expectations and the couple needing to discuss and find a middle ground, but the author isn't in the wrong for following their custody agreement and prioritizing their child's well-being.\n"
