His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners with the ex and son, which is common because the ex has custody. Now, the author is in a four-month relationship with their current girlfriend, who's upset about these dinners and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break it down. The author isn't doing anything illegal or morally wrong by spending time with their son. Parental rights and custody arrangements mean they should continue to have that relationship. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Four months is a significant time in a relationship, and expecting to be included in family dinners might be a reasonable request for some people.\n\nBut the author isn't forced to include the girlfriend in those dinners. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or not feeling included in the author's life. However, the author has a right to maintain their relationship with their child without pressure to bring a partner along, especially if it's not the child's custodial parent. The key here is that the dinners are about the child, not a date. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing their son's needs and maintaining the existing schedule with the ex.\n\nThat said, communication is important. The author might need to explain the nature of these dinners to the girlfriend and set boundaries to prevent misunderstandings. But the act itself isn't wrong. It's a matter of balancing both relationships respectfully. The author isn't in the wrong for maintaining a necessary and healthy relationship with their son without including the girlfriend yet.\n"
