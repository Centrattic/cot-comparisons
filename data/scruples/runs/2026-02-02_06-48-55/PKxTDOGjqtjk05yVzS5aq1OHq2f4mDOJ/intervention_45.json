      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is at fault. The situation involves the author having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset and wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a six-year-old son and a good relationship with the ex. Since they have custody, the author's involvement is appropriate. The dinners are probably for the child's well-being and maintaining a relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has been dating the author for four months and feels left out. She might feel insecure or that the ex has more access than her.\n\nBut the author is not in a committed marriage or a long-term relationship where the girlfriend would have certain expectations. Four months into a relationship, the author might not see the dinners as a problem because they're part of their parenting arrangement. The key here is whether the dinners are actually dating or just family time. The author clarifies it's not a date, but the girlfriend interprets it as such, which could be a communication issue.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything unethical or illegal. They're maintaining a relationship with their child. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author could be more considerate by explaining the situation better and maybe gradually including the girlfriend if appropriate. But it's too soon to change the established routine. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the dinners are part of their parent-child time, and the girlfriend's discomfort is more about insecurity than wrongdoing by the author.\n"
