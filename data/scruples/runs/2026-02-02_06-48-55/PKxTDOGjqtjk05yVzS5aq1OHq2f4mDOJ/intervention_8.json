      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The son is six, and the ex has custody but they have a good relationship. They have these dinners once a week or every other week. The girlfriend is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet but mentions if they last long-term, maybe. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is spending time with his ex and child, which is appropriate since he's the father. The ex has custody, so it's part of their custody arrangement. The girlfriend is upset about not being included. The author is in a four-month relationship, which is relatively new. The girlfriend wants to be part of those dinners, but the author isn't comfortable yet.\n\nNow, considering common relationship norms, when someone is in a new relationship, how much integration should there be between the new partner and the ex? It's common for people to have boundaries, especially if the relationship is still in the early stages. The author isn't doing anything wrong by spending time with his child. However, the girlfriend's feelings here are valid because she might feel left out or insecure. But the author is also within his rights to set boundaries, especially since the dinners are with his ex and son.\n\nIs it the author's fault for not including the girlfriend? Well, the author is maintaining a relationship with his child, which is important. However, the girlfriend's discomfort might stem from not feeling included in the author's family life. But the author hasn't been in the relationship long enough for the girlfriend to expect inclusion in those specific events. The author's reasoning is that it's too soon, which makes sense. The key is communication. If the author has communicated his reasons to the girlfriend and she's still upset, maybe there's a misunderstanding or different expectations. However, the author isn't doing anything that's against normal social norms. So I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's feelings are her issue, but the author is justified in maintaining his parental relationship without involving the new girlfriend yet.\n"
