His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author has dinners with his ex and their six-year-old son, which his current girlfriend is uncomfortable with. The girlfriend doesn't like that these dinners happen without her and calls them dates. The author isn't ready to include her yet, thinking it's too soon, but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a good relationship with his ex and their son, which is important for the child's well-being. Co-parenting often requires cooperation and regular contact. However, the girlfriend is feeling left out and concerned about these dinners. \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. **Co-parenting vs. Romantic Relationship**: The dinners are primarily for the child's benefit, not a romantic date. The ex's role here is as a parent, not a partner. Including the new girlfriend might complicate the co-parenting relationship if the ex isn't comfortable with that.\n2. **Timing and Comfort**: The author is in a four-month relationship and isn't ready to include the girlfriend in family dinners. It's reasonable to take time to build trust and comfort, especially when involving an ex.\n3. **Communication**: The author might need to communicate his stance clearly to his girlfriend to manage expectations. However, the main issue is whether he's wrong for not including her.\n4. **Boundaries**: The author isn't doing anything that's against the ex's wishes since the ex agrees to these dinners. The problem is the girlfriend's discomfort, which is more about their relationship dynamics than the author's actions toward the ex.\n\nWhile the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't necessarily wrong for maintaining these dinners. The priority is the child's well-being, and the author isn't violating any agreements. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations or communicate her concerns more effectively. The author isn't in the wrong for not including her yet, especially in a new relationship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
