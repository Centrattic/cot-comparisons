We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.

It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author has a six-year-old son with custody arrangements, and they have regular dinners with the ex and child. Now, the girlfriend is upset and wants to be included, but the author isn't comfortable yet because it's only been four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's ex has custody, but they have a good relationship and can see their son with notice. The dinners are just the three of them, which is a normal custody arrangement. The girlfriend is new, and she's not happy with these dinners, calling them dates and wanting to be included. The author feels it's too soon.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is maintaining a relationship with their child, which is important. The ex is part of the child's life, so those dinners are necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or feeling left out, but that doesn't mean the author is doing something wrong. The author isn't hiding anything; they're just maintaining a necessary relationship. However, communication is key. The author might need to explain the situation better to the girlfriend to manage her expectations. But the act of having dinners with the ex and child isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault here. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
