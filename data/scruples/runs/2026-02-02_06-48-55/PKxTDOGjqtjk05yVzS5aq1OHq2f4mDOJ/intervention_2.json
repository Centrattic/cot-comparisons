It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners, which the ex allows as long as he gives notice. Now, he's dating a girlfriend for four months, and she's uncomfortable with these dinners, thinking they're dates. She wants to be included, but he's not ready for that yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the frequency of the dinners (weekly or every other week), the girlfriend's feelings, and the author's perspective that it's too soon to include her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's side, maintaining a relationship with his son is important and necessary. The ex allows it, so it's not like he's doing anything against the custody agreement. The dinners are with his child and ex, which is part of co-parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel insecure or left out, especially after four months of dating. It's common for partners to want to be involved in their significant other's life, including their children. However, the author's hesitation might stem from wanting to protect his son's relationship with his ex or not wanting to push the girlfriend into a situation too soon.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the author isn't doing anything illegal or against the custody agreement. However, relationships require communication and consideration of each other's feelings. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, and the author might need to address her concerns, maybe by including her in the future if both agree. But right now, since the dinners are part of co-parenting and not dates, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, he might need to have a conversation to manage his girlfriend's expectations.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is feeling excluded, maybe he should consider her feelings more. However, co-parenting is essential, and it's not his fault that the ex allows these dinners. So, balancing both perspectives, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but he should communicate better with his girlfriend.\n"
