      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including the current girlfriend. The situation is that the author has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have dinners together. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and calls these dinners \"dates\" she wants to be part of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is co-parenting with the ex, which is normal. The dinners are for the son's benefit, right? The ex has custody, so the author's time with the son is probably scheduled and necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend, being new in the relationship (four months), is feeling excluded. But is there an expectation that she should be included in these co-parenting dinners?\n\nThe key points here are: the timing of the relationship, the purpose of the dinners, and the author's comfort level. The author isn't ready to include the girlfriend yet, which is their right. The dinners are between parent, child, and the ex for custody arrangements. Including a new partner in co-parenting situations can be complicated and might not be necessary unless the partner is part of the child's life. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but does that mean the author is wrong?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling them dates\u2014might be a misunderstanding. These dinners are about the child, not romantic dates. The author's stance that it's too soon makes sense. The ex's role here is as a parent, not a romantic partner, so the dinners are about the child's needs. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining the existing routine for the child's sake. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, but the author isn't in the wrong for not including her yet. So the answer should be B.\n"
