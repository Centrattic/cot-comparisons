His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The user is asking for an answer between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the author has a 6-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have a good relationship and see each other regularly. The dinners are just the three of them, which is common for co-parenting. Now, the author has a new girlfriend, four months into the relationship. The girl doesn't like that he's having these dinners and wants to be included. He's not comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon.\n\nSo, the key points here are co-parenting arrangements and the girlfriend's feelings. Co-parents often have to make decisions about their new partners, especially when it comes to children. The author is maintaining a relationship with his son, which is important for the child's well-being. But including his girlfriend in those dinners might feel intrusive or unnecessary, especially since they've only been dating four months. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset, seeing the dinners as dates, which might not be the case. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his relationship with his child. However, communication is key here. The author should explain that these dinners are about co-parenting and the child's needs, not a romantic relationship. That way, the girlfriend understands the context and can feel respected. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's being honest with his girlfriend and the dinners are necessary for the child's upbringing, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend needs to respect the existing co-parenting arrangement. The author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in these dinners, especially so early in the relationship. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but it's important he communicates clearly with his girlfriend to manage her expectations and feelings.\n"
