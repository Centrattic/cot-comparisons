      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The person has a six-year-old son with their ex, and they have regular dinners. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. The current girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and calls these dinners dates. She wants to be included, but the person isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the person is wrong for not including their girlfriend in these family dinners. Let me break it down.\n\nThe dinners are with the ex and the child, which is a parental arrangement. The ex has custody, so the person has scheduled time with the kid, which is a normal co-parenting thing. The girl is the current girlfriend, but the relationship is only four months old. The person isn't ready to include her yet, which is understandable. People have different comfort levels with integrating new partners into their family lives, especially when there's a child involved.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she feels excluded. That's valid because when you're in a relationship, you might expect your partner to include you in important parts of their life. But the other person is a parent, so these dinners are about parenting time, not just socializing. Including a new partner in family dinners so soon could be complicated, especially if the ex is involved.\n\nI should consider if there's any obligation to include the girlfriend. Since they've been dating four months, it's early days. The person isn't in the wrong for not feeling ready. It's their child, and they have the right to spend time with them as per their custody agreement. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the person isn't obligated to include her in those specific family dinners. They can have other plans to include her, but the dinners with the ex and child are separate.\n\nAlso, the ex being present complicates things. If the girlfriend were to join, it might create a situation where the ex feels she's encroaching on their time with the child. The person's approach is to maintain a boundary, which is reasonable. They can still build trust with their girlfriend by having other activities together, but the dinners are a different matter.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their parental relationship with their child, and the girlfriend's discomfort is something she needs to address by communicating her needs, but it's not the person's fault for not including her in those specific family dinners. The answer should be B.\n"
