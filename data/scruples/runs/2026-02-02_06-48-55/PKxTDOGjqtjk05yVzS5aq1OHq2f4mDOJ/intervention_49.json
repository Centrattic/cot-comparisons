We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.

It just seems too soon to me right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author's situation: he has a 6-year-old son with custody to the ex, and they have a good relationship. They have regular dinners just the three of them. The girlfriend, who he's been dating for four months, is upset and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about boundaries in a new relationship and co-parenting. The author's ex is the custodial parent, so it's normal for the author to spend time with their child. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels excluded. But is the author wrong for not including her yet?\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, in a new relationship, especially after a previous one, the ex has a role in the child's life. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate by maintaining that relationship with his son. The dinners are about co-parenting and child's well-being, not dating. The girlfriend calling them dates might be a misunderstanding. \n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In a new relationship, feeling left out can be hurtful. However, the author's stance is that it's too soon. The author isn't obligated to include the girlfriend in co-parenting arrangements unless it's agreed upon. The ex has custody, so the author's relationship with the ex is about the child, not a romantic relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations. It's reasonable for the author to set boundaries, especially if the relationship is still new. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his existing relationship with his son and ex for co-parenting purposes. The real issue might be communication between the author and his girlfriend about expectations. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's maintaining a necessary co-parenting relationship, and it's his right to set boundaries in a new relationship. The girlfriend needs to accept that the author has a history with the ex regarding their child. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
