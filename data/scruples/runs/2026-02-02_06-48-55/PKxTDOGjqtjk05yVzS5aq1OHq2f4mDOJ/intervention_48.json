His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. The scenario is that the author has a six-year-old son with the ex, and they have regular dinners just the three of them. The girlfriend is upset because she feels these dinners are like dates and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet since they've only been dating four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a right to spend time with his child, regardless of the current relationship with the ex. Custody arrangements don't necessarily determine social interactions, so the dinners are probably part of maintaining a relationship with the son. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from jealousy or insecurity, which is common in new relationships. The author's hesitation to include the girlfriend might be because he's not ready for a step-parent role or he wants to maintain the current dynamic. \n\nBut where's the line between being respectful and being in the wrong? If the girlfriend is part of the author's life now, maybe the author should communicate better about the situation. However, including a girlfriend in such situations, especially when the child is with the ex, might not be necessary unless the ex agrees. The key points are communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with his child. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her in every social interaction unless there's a mutual agreement. It's about setting boundaries and managing expectations. The author might need to explain his reasons to the girlfriend to ease her concerns, but that doesn't mean he's in the wrong for not including her yet. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
