      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a 6-year-old son with custody to the ex. They have a good relationship and have regular dinners together. Now, he's dating a new girlfriend for four months, and she's upset because she feels left out of these dinners, calling them dates. He's not comfortable including her yet but acknowledges her feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider a few things. \n\n1. **Parental Rights and Custody**: Since the ex has custody, the father's involvement with the child is appropriate. Regular dinners are part of his parenting time. There's no indication of any issues between the parents that would make these dinners problematic.\n\n2. **New Relationship Dynamics**: The girlfriend is upset because she wants to be included. In a new relationship, boundaries are still being set. The man isn't ready to include her in family dinners, which is his right. There's no obligation to introduce a partner to family that quickly unless both parties agree.\n\n3. **Communication and Respect**: The man is upfront about his feelings, saying he's not comfortable yet but sees a future with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but her expecting inclusion so early might be a stretch. However, open communication is key here. He should discuss this with her to set expectations and ensure both feel respected.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Norms**: In many cultures, a new partner isn't immediately integrated into the ex's life with the child unless it's mutually agreed. The ex's role as a co-parent is separate from the new relationship. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations regarding how quickly family dynamics change.\n\n5. **Potential for Conflict**: If the dinners are a regular occurrence, the girlfriend might feel excluded, but it's not inherently his fault if he hasn't committed to a long-term future yet. However, transparency about his intentions and scheduling could help mitigate her concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the man isn't in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in these dinners, especially since they're part of his custody agreement with the ex. The key here is that he's maintaining his parental responsibilities while being honest about the new relationship stage. The girlfriend needs to respect his boundaries until they're both comfortable with the next steps.\n"
