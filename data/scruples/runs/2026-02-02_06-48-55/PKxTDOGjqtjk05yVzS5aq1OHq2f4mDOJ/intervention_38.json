We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The author's son is six years old, and the ex has custody. The author and ex have a good relationship and have these dinners regularly. The current girlfriend is four months into the relationship and doesn't like the dinners, thinking they're dates, and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with including her yet.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is co-parenting with their ex, which is a common scenario. The dinners are likely for the child's well-being, so that's a key point. The girlfriend is feeling left out, which is a valid emotion, but the author isn't in a legal or moral obligation to include the girlfriend in family matters. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, especially since the relationship is new. \n\nThe author's hesitation to include the girlfriend in these dinners is reasonable because it's about co-parenting and not a social date. The girlfriend might not realize that the dinners are necessary for the child's routine. However, communication is important here. The author should explain why these dinners are separate, but it's not necessarily their fault for not involving the girlfriend yet. \n\nAlso, considering the four-month timeline, it's early in the relationship. The author might not want to complicate things by bringing in an ex. The girlfriend might need to work on her own feelings of insecurity rather than expecting to be included. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in co-parenting dinners. The answer is B.\n"
