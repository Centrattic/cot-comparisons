      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is having dinners with their ex and their six-year-old son. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship. They meet once a week or every other week for dinner. Now, the current girlfriend is upset because she's not included in these dinners and calls them dates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the father of the child, so their relationship with their son is important. Shared custody or visitation rights mean that the father has regular contact, which is healthy for the child. The fact that they communicate well with the ex is also positive for the child's well-being.\n\nNow, the current girlfriend has been dating for four months and is uncomfortable with these dinners. She wants to be included. The author feels it's too soon to involve her in these family dinners. The question is whether the author is wrong for not including the girlfriend yet.\n\nFrom the father's perspective, involving the girlfriend in these dinners might be premature if the relationship isn't stable yet. Introducing a new partner to a child, especially in a situation where the child is with the other parent, could complicate things. The father might want to ensure the relationship is serious before making the girlfriend part of his family life. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel left out or not considered part of the family. Communication is key here. The author should explain his perspective to her, ensuring she understands that it's not about her but about the son's stability and the need to assess the relationship's longevity. \n\nThe ex is the mother, so the father's dinners with her and the child are likely for the child's benefit. Including a new partner could affect the child's routine or the child's relationship with the mother. The father has the right to set boundaries, especially if involving the girlfriend might disrupt the established dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her partner is prioritizing past relationships over the new one. The author should be open to discussing this and setting a timeline for when it's appropriate to include her, if at all. It's important that both partners are on the same page regarding family matters.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has a responsibility to his son and needs to manage the relationship with the ex in a way that's best for the child. The girlfriend needs to respect that, while also expressing her concerns. The author's decision to wait is reasonable, as long as it's communicated clearly and with consideration for both the son's and the girlfriend's feelings.\n"
