His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend. The situation is that the author sees their son, who's in the ex's custody, every week or two for dinner. The girlfriend, who they've been dating four months, is upset about this and wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable yet but might in the long term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is co-parenting with the ex, which requires cooperation. The dinners are for the child's benefit, so that's a key point. The girlfriend's feeling left out is valid, but how long have they been dating? Four months is not very long. The author might not be obligated to include a new partner in existing family routines immediately. However, communication is important. The author says they understand the girlfriend's apprehension, which shows some empathy.\n\nBut is the author doing something wrong? If the dinners are part of a custody arrangement and necessary for the child's well-being, then it's justified. The girlfriend's desire to be included is understandable, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not including her yet. It's about balancing the child's needs with the new relationship's expectations. However, maybe the author should discuss boundaries with the girlfriend to manage expectations. The answer might depend on whether the dynamics are causing significant harm or disrespect. Since the author is upfront and not hiding the dinners, it's more about the girlfriend adjusting to the situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but communication improvements might help. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
