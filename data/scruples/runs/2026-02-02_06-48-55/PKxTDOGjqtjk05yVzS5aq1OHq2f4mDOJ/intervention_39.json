We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the man has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners together, which is common and reasonable for co-parenting. The ex and he have a good relationship, and they coordinate schedules. That part seems okay. \n\nNow, the girlfriend is new\u2014four months into the relationship. She's uncomfortable with the dinners and wants to be included. The man isn't ready to include her yet but acknowledges her feelings. The key here is the timing and the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The man isn't wrong for not wanting to include her yet, especially since it's only been four months. Co-parenting with an ex is different from a new partner. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel left out or insecure. However, it's also about mutual respect. \n\nThe man isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by spending time with his child. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity rather than a justified concern. The man is being honest about his feelings, which is good. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Maybe not. He's balancing his responsibilities as a father with his new relationship. The girlfriend needs to communicate her needs better too. But the man isn't obligated to include her in those dinners unless it becomes a pattern that affects their relationship negatively. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for not including his girlfriend yet, but he should continue to communicate and find a middle ground as the relationship progresses.\n"
