His mother has custody, but we have a good relationship and as long as I give her notice I can see my son whenever.  We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is asking if it's their fault for having dinners with their ex and son without including their current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person has a six-year-old son with custody to the ex, but they have a good relationship and see each other regularly. They have weekly or every other week dinners with the ex and son. Now they're dating a girlfriend for four months who doesn't like these dinners and calls them dates, wanting to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon but acknowledges the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong here. Let me think. The author is spending time with their child, which is their right. The ex is involved in the child's life, which is common in co-parenting situations. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded. The author is not in a position where they must include the girlfriend in all their personal time, especially time with their child. However, the girlfriend might feel it's a sign of commitment or exclusivity. But four months into a relationship, expecting to be included in every family activity might be too soon. The author is being honest about their feelings, not forcing the girlfriend to accept it but also not feeling ready. The ex is part of their child's life, so it's necessary to maintain that relationship for the child's well-being.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their child's relationship with the ex, which is appropriate. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't obligated to include her unless they choose to. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
