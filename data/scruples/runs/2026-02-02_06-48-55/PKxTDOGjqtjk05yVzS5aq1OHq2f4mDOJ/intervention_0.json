      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has dinners with their ex and son, and the current girlfriend is upset because she wants to be included. The author isn't comfortable with that yet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a good relationship with the ex and their son, and they have regular dinners. The current girlfriend is four months into the relationship and is uncomfortable with the dinners, seeing them as dates. The author isn't ready to include her yet.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. In a new relationship, it's common for partners to want to be included in each other's lives, especially when it comes to children. However, the author is in a position where they're co-parenting with the ex, which is important for the child's well-being. There's no indication that the ex is trying to undermine the current relationship or that the dinners are harmful. The author is being honest with the girlfriend about not wanting to include her yet, which is communication.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. She might feel insecure or left out. The author needs to balance their commitment to co-parenting with their new partner's feelings. But since co-parenting is necessary for the child, and there's no conflict or deceit, the author might not be in the wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend adjusting to the situation. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical; they're maintaining a relationship with their child. The real problem might be communication between the couple to find a middle ground, like gradually including the girlfriend in some activities if both are comfortable. But since the author isn't forcing the ex or the child to exclude the girlfriend and is being upfront, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
