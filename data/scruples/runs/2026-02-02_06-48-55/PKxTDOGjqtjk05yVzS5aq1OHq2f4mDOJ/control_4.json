We also do a once a week or once every other week dinner somewhere just the three of us depending on our schedules.  \n\nI\u2019ve been dating my current girlfriend for about four months.  She does not like that I have these dinners.   She calls them dates.  She wants to be included in them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that just yet.  If we work out long term, sure.   It just seems too soon to me right now.  I can understand her apprehension at the situation though.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about having dinners with an ex and their son without including the current girlfriend. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the user is seeing his son, which is a custody arrangement where the ex has custody but they have a good relationship. They have weekly or bi-weekly dinners with the ex and the son. That seems normal because the father has rights to spend time with his child. The ex is probably involved in the son's life, which is typical in custody situations.\n\nNow, the current girlfriend is upset because she feels left out. She calls the dinners \"dates\" and wants to be included. The user is not comfortable with that yet, thinking it's too soon in the four-month relationship. The question is whether the user is wrong for not involving the girlfriend in these dinners.\n\nI need to consider a few points. First, the user has a right to spend time with his child. The ex is part of the child's life, and those dinners are likely arranged for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's discomfort might come from feeling excluded, which is her valid emotion. But is the user obligated to include her? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user hasn't included the girlfriend in these family dinners, which could be seen as not respecting her feelings. However, he's also not in a position where he's doing something wrong by spending time with his child. The girlfriend might need to work on her comfort level with the ex's involvement, but the user isn't necessarily wrong for not rushing to include her. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The user could consider the girlfriend's feelings without compromising his relationship with his son. However, the user hasn't done anything unethical or wrong by not involving her. The boyfriend's actions are within his rights. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities or expectations in the relationship. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for not including the girlfriend in these dinners, especially since the dinners are for the child. However, he might need to address her feelings to maintain the relationship. But in terms of right or wrong, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
