      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for having dinners with his ex and son without including his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: He has a six-year-old son with his ex, who has custody. They have regular dinners as a three, and he's been dating his current girlfriend for four months. The girlfriend is upset because she doesn't like that he's having these dinners and calls them dates, wanting to be included.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, communication, and expectations in a new relationship. The author is clear that he's not comfortable including his girlfriend yet but acknowledges her feelings. He's been with his ex for longer (since the son is six, the ex has been part of his life for at least six years) and maintaining that relationship with his son is important for the child's well-being.\n\nIn a new relationship, especially one that's only four months old, it's common for partners to have different paces regarding integrating into each other's lives. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining his relationship with his ex as long as it's respectful and there's no infidelity or deceit. The ex has custody, so it's in the child's best interest to maintain a bond with both parents.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. She might feel insecure or left out, especially if these dinners are a regular occurrence. But the author isn't obligated to include his girlfriend in these specific family dinners unless he's open to it. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The author is honest about his feelings, which is important for the relationship. He's also open to changing things if the relationship progresses. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not including his girlfriend yet. It's a matter of personal boundaries and the dynamics of a new relationship. The ex's role in the child's life is legitimate, and the author isn't being dishonest or neglectful. The real issue might be communication between him and his girlfriend to address her concerns without forcing changes he's not ready for.\n"
