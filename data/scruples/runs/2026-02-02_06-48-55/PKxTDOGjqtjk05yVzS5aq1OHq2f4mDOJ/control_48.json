      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves the author having dinners with their ex and their son, which is a normal co-parenting arrangement. The ex has custody, but they have a good relationship and schedule these dinners as needed. The current girlfriend is dating the author for four months and is upset because she's not included in these dinners. She calls them dates, which the author clarifies they're not. The author isn't ready to include the girlfriend yet, but they see her as a long-term possibility.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. Co-parenting is about the child's well-being, and regular dinners with the ex and child are part of that. The girlfriend's discomfort might stem from insecurity or feeling neglected, but the author has a valid reason to maintain boundaries. It's only been four months into the relationship, so expecting inclusion might be too soon. However, communication is important here. The author should explain their perspective to the girlfriend, emphasizing co-parenting vs. dating. If the girlfriend can't respect that boundary, maybe it's a red flag. But the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining those dinners. The right answer is B.\n"
