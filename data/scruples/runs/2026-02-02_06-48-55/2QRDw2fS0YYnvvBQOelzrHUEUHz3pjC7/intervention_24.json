Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom who feeds her own kids and a friend of her son, but when the friend's family unexpectedly arrives and asks to stay for dinner, she declines and now feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom already has three kids, which means she's managing a lot of meals. The friend Chris comes over often, and she's been feeding him. But when his family shows up unannounced, she didn't prepare for them. Her response was to tell the parents to get takeout and then reduce Chris's visits. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion. Let's break it down. The key points are: \n\n1. The family arrived uninvited and unannounced. The mom hadn't prepared for four extra people. \n2. She tried to politely decline by suggesting takeout, which is a reasonable approach. \n3. The parents then said they didn't have dinner plans, which complicates things. \n4. The mom's reaction was to limit Chris's visits to avoid future situations. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to feed people who just show up without notice. Her home is her space, and she's managing her household. However, the way she handled it could be seen as abrupt, especially after the parents indicated they were hungry. But she did offer a solution (takeout) and perhaps it's reasonable to expect that families should plan their own meals. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mom could have been more gracious, but she's also managing her own family's needs. The fact that she's a mom of three kids and the financial situation of Chris's family isn't the mom's responsibility. \n\nI think the mom isn't in the wrong because she wasn't expecting the family and had a right to set boundaries. So the answer would be B (No). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The key is whether she was rude or inconsiderate. She did offer a polite solution and then set boundaries, which is reasonable. So B makes sense.\n"
