Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a mom, didn't feed Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. She felt it wasn't her responsibility, but now she's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three, cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, and the family isn't well-off. The parents and siblings showed up without being invited. The author didn't prepare for them, and when they mentioned being hungry, she told them to get takeout. Then she reduced the number of visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the family came uninvited, and the author wasn't prepared. She was polite but made it clear they weren't part of the meal. On the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot and she could have offered some help, even a small gesture. But the author didn't want to be taken advantage of, especially with her own kids to feed.\n\nThe key points are consent and preparedness. The author didn't agree to host them, so she's not obligated. However, in social situations, sometimes people might expect some level of hospitality. But if the guests came uninvited, the author isn't responsible. The response of suggesting takeout and closing the door seems reasonable. She also adjusted future interactions to prevent this, which is fair.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She handled it politely and set boundaries. The parents should have communicated their need before arriving. The answer would be B.\n"
