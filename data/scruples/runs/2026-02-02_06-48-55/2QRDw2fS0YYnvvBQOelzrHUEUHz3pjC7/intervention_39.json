Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom who's cooking a lot for her three kids. She has a son's friend, Chris, who comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him because she knows his family isn't well off. But when Chris's parents and siblings show up unexpectedly to pick him up, they comment on the food smell and one mentions being hungry. The mom doesn't offer to feed them, even though it's clear they're in a tough spot financially.\n\nThe mom then tells her son to limit Chris's visits or suggest Chris's place instead. She feels conflicted about this decision. The question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the situation from her perspective. She's managing a household with three teenagers, already cooking a lot. The unexpected arrival of four more people would add significant stress and financial burden. It's reasonable for her to feel overwhelmed, especially if she hadn't planned for them. She might not have the resources or time to accommodate them without overextending.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family is in a difficult financial situation. The parents didn't plan a dinner, and the kids are hungry. In a society where food insecurity is real, offering a meal could be seen as an act of kindness and support. The mom's response of suggesting takeout and urging them to leave quickly might come off as dismissive or not empathetic, especially since she's aware of their economic struggles.\n\nHowever, the mom had not prepared for this group, and it's within her rights to set boundaries for her home. She's not obligated to feed people who haven't asked ahead of time. The key here is whether her actions were stingy or just practical. She was already responsible for her own family and a regular guest. Adding four more without notice might not be feasible.\n\nThe father's comment \"not really\" when asked about dinner could imply a need, but the mom's response was to send them to takeout, which is a gesture. She didn't refuse entirely but suggested an alternative. The action of reducing Chris's visits is a boundary to prevent future stress, which is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's empathy for the family's situation, the mom's decision to set boundaries is reasonable. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her household's needs and not being able to accommodate unexpected guests. The answer would be B.\n"
