Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family. The scenario involves the author, a mom of three, who usually feeds Chris when he comes over. But when Chris's family suddenly showed up, including his parents and siblings, the author didn't prepare extra food. She sent them away after a brief conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a single mom with three teenagers, which means her resources might be limited. She's used to feeding Chris occasionally, but not expecting his entire family. The sudden arrival of four more people without prior notice would be a significant burden. She politely declined, suggesting takeout and ushering them out. Her reasoning was that she didn't cook for them and wanted to avoid the situation in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a tight spot. The father mentioned they weren't having a nice dinner, so maybe they needed the meal. The author's response could be seen as cold, but she's prioritizing her family's needs. It's also possible that the family expected to use her hospitality, which might not be fair. The author's decision to limit future visits is understandable to prevent similar situations.\n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. The author isn't obligated to feed four unexpected guests, especially when she wasn't prepared. However, the way she handled it\u2014sending them away without offering any food\u2014might come across as harsh. Maybe she could have offered a quick snack or a small meal instead of turning them away. But since she didn't cook for them, her actions were within her rights. The key point is whether she had a responsibility to feed them. Since they came unannounced and she wasn't expecting four people, she's not in the wrong. She's managing her resources and family's well-being. However, if there's an ongoing pattern of this, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but in this specific incident, she's not wrong.\n"
