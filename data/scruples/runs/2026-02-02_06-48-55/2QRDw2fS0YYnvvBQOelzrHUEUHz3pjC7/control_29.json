Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mom, who already has three kids, is cooking a lot to feed them. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But then, last week, Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly\u2014parents and two siblings. They're at the door, and the family starts commenting on how nice the house is and how good the food smells. One of the kids mentions being hungry. The mom responds by saying she's sure their parents have dinner planned, but the dad says \"not really.\" The mom then suggests takeout and ushers them out. She's now cutting back on Chris's visits because she doesn't want this to happen again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's perspective. She's a parent with three teenagers who eat a lot, so she's already managing a lot of food prep. She's feeding Chris occasionally, which is generous. But when the whole family arrives unexpectedly, she wasn't prepared. She was polite but made it clear that she wasn't cooking for four more people. Her response was to suggest takeout and send them on their way. She's now limiting Chris's visits to avoid this situation again.\n\nFrom her point of view, she's protecting her resources. She's not obligated to feed other people's families, especially without prior notice. She's doing her best for her own household, and the sudden influx of four extra people when she wasn't expecting them is a burden. Her response was firm but polite, and she's adjusting how her son interacts with Chris to prevent future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have thought that if Chris was welcome, then the whole family would also be welcome. The father's response that they \"weren't really\" planning dinner implies they might be in a tough spot financially, which could make the situation more sensitive. The mom's comment about takeout might be seen as dismissive, but she's also trying to maintain boundaries.\n\nIs the mom at fault? Well, she didn't offer food, but she also wasn't rude. She was honest about her situation. The problem is that maybe Chris's family didn't realize the mom wasn't expecting so many people. It's possible that the son didn't communicate to his friend that the family should confirm before visiting. However, the mom isn't responsible for the family's lack of planning. She handled the situation as best as she could under the circumstances, given that she wasn't prepared for four extra people.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to expect guests to confirm numbers in advance. If the family arrived without notice, that's on them. The mom isn't in the wrong for not accommodating last-minute guests when she wasn't prepared. She's within her rights to set boundaries, especially as a parent managing her household's needs. The fact that she's adjusting Chris's visits shows she's trying to find a solution without being hostile.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). She handled the situation appropriately given the unexpected circumstances and the need to prioritize her own family's needs.\n"
