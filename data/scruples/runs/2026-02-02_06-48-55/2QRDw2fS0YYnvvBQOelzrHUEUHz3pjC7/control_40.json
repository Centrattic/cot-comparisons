Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing in this situation. The scenario involves a mom who's feeding her own kids and a friend of her son, Chris. When Chris's family comes over, they end up on her doorstep and the mom didn't expect to feed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. She's feeding Chris when he comes over. But when Chris's family shows up, she wasn't prepared for four more people. She tried to be polite but made it clear she hadn't cooked for them. The dad said they weren't really planning dinner, and she then suggested takeout and sent them away. After that, she reduced Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's under no obligation to feed someone else's family without being asked. She managed the situation politely, even though she wasn't happy. On the other hand, maybe the family was in need, and she could have offered help. But was it her responsibility? She wasn't expecting them, and she had already prepared for Chris. The father didn't ask for help, just commented on the food smell. The mom's reaction seems reasonable because she didn't want to have to cook for more people last minute. She also adjusted by limiting Chris's visits to avoid future issues.\n\nI think the key points are her right to manage her household and the sudden, unplanned guests. She didn't do anything wrong by not feeding them, especially since they didn't ask. She was polite and even suggested takeout. So the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
