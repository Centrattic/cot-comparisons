Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mom has two teenagers and a preteen, so she's cooking a lot already. Then Chris, her son's friend, comes over often. Chris isn't well off, and his family showed up unannounced with two siblings and his parents. They were on the doorstep, and the kid needed the bathroom, which they used. The family commented on the food and said they were hungry. The mom didn't cook for them, told them she wasn't planning to feed them, and suggested takeout, then ushered them out. She later cut down on Chris coming over.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? The user thinks she is, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, from her perspective: She's a working mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. She didn't know Chris' family was coming, so she didn't prepare for four extra people. She was polite but set a boundary. She felt she was protecting her family's dinner plans. Her son's friend is coming over a lot, which might be causing strain.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris' family is poor, so maybe they were in a tough spot and expected her to help. But did they ask? She didn't cook for them, but they weren't invited to dinner. The mom was honest about not having food ready. She was polite but firm. She didn't shame them, just said she wasn't planning to feed them. Maybe she could have offered something small, but she had no prior notice. Also, she's setting boundaries for her son to limit visits because of the stress. \n\nIs it wrong to not feed people who are poor? The mom isn't refusing to help; she just wasn't prepared. The family didn't ask for food, just mentioned they were hungry. The mom's response was appropriate given the circumstances. She's not obligated to feed them, especially since they showed up without notice. She's prioritizing her family's needs, which is reasonable. \n\nBut maybe she could have been more empathetic. However, she did say she was happy to feed Chris when he comes over. The issue was the unexpected four guests. So, she's not in the wrong because she communicated clearly and set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
