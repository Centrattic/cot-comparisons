Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing in this situation. The scenario involves a mom with three kids who often hosts her son's friend Chris. Chris's family shows up unexpectedly when they come to pick him up, and the mom didn't prepare food for them. She politely deflected and then decided to limit Chris's visits because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's perspective. She's responsible for feeding her own family regularly, which is a big task. When Chris's family arrives unannounced, she wasn't expecting four more people. It's reasonable that she didn't cook for them. Her response of suggesting takeout and urging them to leave seems polite but firm. She also adjusted her son's social plans afterward, which is her right to protect her household's comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a difficult situation. If they're not well-off, maybe they're struggling to provide meals, and the mom's house smelled of food, leading them to expect a meal. The father's response \"not really\" when asked about dinner might indicate they were in a spot. But the mom isn't obligated to feed them, especially since they arrived without notice. She didn't offer food before being asked, which could have been an opportunity to clarify.\n\nThe mom's feelings of guilt are understandable because she's trying to balance her resources. But she set boundaries and acted in her family's interest. People can't be expected to host others without prior notice. The key points are whether she was responsible in her response and if her actions were reasonable. She didn't make a scene, handled it politely, and made necessary changes afterward. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She wasn't obligated to feed them and handled the situation with respect. The decision to limit visits is her choice to maintain her household's peace and resources.\n"
