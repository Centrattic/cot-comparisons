Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the extra guests. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, she's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with his parents and siblings, she didn't plan to feed them. She tried to politely say that maybe their parents have dinner planned, but the dad says they don't. She then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether she did the wrong thing. The user thinks she is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me consider the perspectives.\n\nFirst, from the mom's side: she's managing a household with three teenagers, which is a lot. She didn't expect four more people to show up. She might feel it's unfair to have to cook for them on short notice. She's already stretched thin. She's being polite but setting a boundary. She even tried to be diplomatic. Also, she's considering reducing the frequency of Chris visiting to avoid future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family came for a specific purpose (to pick up Chris), but mentioned they were hungry and needed the bathroom. The mom might have felt obligated to help, but maybe she didn't have to. However, maybe the family expected a meal, especially since they were already at her home. But since it was a pickup, maybe the mom isn't responsible to feed them. The father did say they weren't planning dinner, which complicates things. \n\nBut was it the mom's responsibility to feed them? She didn't invite them, and they came just to pick up Chris. She might not be in the wrong for not accommodating unexpected guests. Setting boundaries is okay. However, there's a social aspect to consider. In some cultures, hosting guests might be expected, but she's not in a position to do so. The mother is trying to balance her resources and family needs.\n\nShe did offer a polite solution (takeout), but they had to leave. She didn't refuse them food entirely, just redirected them. She's also taking action to prevent future situations by limiting Chris's visits. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mom is in a tough spot. She's being reasonable in her decision, given her circumstances. She's not in the wrong for not feeding them, especially since they were unexpected. She communicated politely and set boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
