Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a mom) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. The mom had already prepared for her own kids and Chris, but when Chris's family arrived unannounced, she didn't cook for them, which led to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three, cooking a lot already. Chris is a regular visitor, so she's used to feeding him. But when Chris's family showed up, she wasn't expecting four extra people. She tried to be polite by suggesting they get takeout. The father said they weren't really planning dinner, and she pushed them out the door. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting down Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, she's managing her family's resources and time. It's reasonable to expect that unexpected guests might not be accommodated, especially if it's a last-minute thing. She didn't want to overextend herself, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there could have been a more gracious way to handle it. Instead of immediately pushing them out, maybe offering a snack or something small if she couldn't serve a full meal. But she did say they should get takeout, which is a practical solution. However, the way she ushered them out might have been abrupt. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and action. Her intent was to protect her family's resources and not to be taken advantage of. Her action was to politely suggest takeout and then ask them to leave. The father's response (\"not really\") might have been a challenge, but she stood her ground. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not uncommon for people to feel uncomfortable about being asked to feed unexpected guests, especially if they hadn't planned for it. So her reaction might be seen as reasonable. However, the emotional response from the family (commenting on the smell of food and being hungry) might have been a social cue she could have addressed more compassionately. Maybe offering a glass of water or a quick snack before sending them on their way could have been a middle ground.\n\nBut considering that she had already stated she wasn't prepared for four extra people, and she didn't want to be in a situation where she had to feed them, her decision to limit Chris's visits seems like a reasonable self-protective measure. It's about setting boundaries, which is important, especially for someone with a busy household.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would hinge on whether her actions were unreasonably harsh or if they were a necessary boundary. Since she tried to be polite and suggested an alternative (takeout), and given the context of managing a large family, the author is likely not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
