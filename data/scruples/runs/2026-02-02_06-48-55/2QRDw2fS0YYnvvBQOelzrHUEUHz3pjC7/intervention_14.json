Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a mom who's been feeding her son's friend Chris when he comes over. The friend's family shows up unexpectedly, and the author didn't prepare for them. She tells them she's not cooking for them, and then cuts the visits to reduce the chance of this happening again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has three kids, which already means she's cooking a lot. Chris is a regular visitor, so she's used to feeding him, but when his whole family shows up without notice, it's a different situation. She didn't plan for four extra people, which could be a financial or time burden, especially if they don't have the resources.\n\nBut then again, the family came to pick Chris up, so maybe they weren't expecting to stay. The siblings were just there because they were coming to get Chris. One wanted to use the bathroom, and the others mentioned being hungry. The author tried to handle it diplomatically by saying her parents would have dinner planned, but the father responded \"not really.\" That's a red flag, right? If they don't have food, maybe they're in a tough spot.\n\nThe author then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Her intention was to protect her family's resources but also to avoid a confrontation. However, she later reduces Chris's visits to avoid the situation again. Now she's feeling guilty but also justified.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't have an obligation to feed Chris's family, especially if they showed up unannounced. She was already feeding Chris, but the family wasn't part of the original agreement. On the other hand, maybe there's an expectation when someone's family comes to pick up a kid that they might need a bathroom or a quick snack. But the author didn't prepare for that, so she's within her rights to not provide food.\n\nHowever, the way she handled it\u2014ushering them out quickly and reducing visits\u2014could be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a more considerate way to handle it, like offering a snack instead of takeout. But given the circumstances, she might not have the resources or time. The key here is that she isn't responsible for their situation, but her actions might come off as dismissive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's not obligated to feed others unexpectedly. However, there might be a better approach. The question is whether her actions were wrong. The answer would depend on societal expectations and personal ethics. If the community expects more generosity, she might be seen as wrong, but if the focus is on her own family's needs, she's justified.\n"
