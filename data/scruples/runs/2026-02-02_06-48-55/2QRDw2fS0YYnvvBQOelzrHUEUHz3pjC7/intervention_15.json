Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has three kids, which already means she's cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son and visits often, so she's used to feeding him. Last week, Chris's entire family came to pick him up, including two siblings. They mentioned how nice the house was and how good the food smelled. One of the kids even said they were hungry. The mom tried to politely say that the parents probably had dinner planned, but the dad replied \"not really.\" She then told them to get takeout and ushered them out. Now, she's cutting down on Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nThe user thinks the mom is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer should be A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nLet me consider the arguments. On one hand, the mom is managing her household and resources. She didn't expect four extra people and wasn't prepared. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her family's needs and not feel obligated to feed others. People can't be expected to cook for unexpected guests unless they invite them. The family was on the doorstep, not invited in, so the mom was within her rights to ask them to leave or get their own food.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's kind to help others in need, especially if they're struggling financially. However, the mom didn't know their financial situation beforehand. She made a polite excuse and suggested takeout, which is a solution that doesn't require her to cook. She also adjusted her son's interactions with Chris to prevent future issues, which is a reasonable step to manage her household.\n\nThe key points are: the mom wasn't in a position to feed four unexpected people, she handled the situation politely, and she's adjusting to avoid future issues. She didn't act aggressively; she set boundaries. So, it seems she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
