Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's feeding her kids and their friend Chris, but when Chris's family showed up unexpectedly, she didn't want to feed them. She ended up sending them out for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has three kids, two teenagers and a preteen. She's cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when his family showed up unannounced, she didn't have food for them. She tried to politely decline, but the parents didn't prepare food either. She then ushered them out and decided to limit Chris's visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, the author is managing her household and the unexpected guests could be a burden. She didn't plan to feed four extra people. On the other hand, she's in a position where she's aware of Chris's family's financial situation. Refusing to feed them might be seen as insensitive, even if it's unexpected.\n\nBut wait, she did consider offering takeout and suggested they leave to get it. That shows she tried to help but within her limits. Also, she's a parent prioritizing her own family's needs. It's understandable that she's overwhelmed with her own kids. However, the family was already there, and maybe she could have offered a small gesture, like a snack, to mitigate the situation.\n\nBut she didn't have food ready. Maybe she's not obligated to feed unexpected guests, especially if they didn't ask in advance. The parents also said they weren't planning dinner. So, pushing them to get takeout isn't unreasonable. She also adjusted by reducing Chris's visits, showing she's trying to prevent future issues. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She handled it diplomatically and tried to be helpful within her means. The parents should have communicated better. So the answer is B.\n"
