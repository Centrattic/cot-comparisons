Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is wrong for not feeding the extra four people from Chris's family who unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, the mother has a busy schedule with three kids who eat a lot. She's cooking a lot as it is. Chris comes over often, and she feeds him, which is generous. But when Chris's whole family shows up without notice, expecting to be fed, she's not prepared. She politely declines, suggesting they take out food and even urges them to leave because the kids are hungry. \n\nNow, the key points here are intention and hospitality. She didn't cook for them, and she's managing her household. She's a single mom, which might add to the stress. The father from Chris's family said they weren't planning much, but the mother had already prepared for her family. \n\nI think it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. She's not obligated to feed them, especially since they came without prior notice. She handled it politely, so maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that offering a bit more hospitality could help, but given the circumstances, she did what she could. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
