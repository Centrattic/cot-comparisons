Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a mom who's hosting her son's friend Chris, who's from a less well-off family. Chris's family showed up unexpectedly with his siblings, and the mom hadn't planned to feed them. She politely tried to send them on their way, then decided to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's a single mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris's family comes unannounced, and she's not responsible for feeding them. She tried to be polite but firm. Then she reduces visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, she's not obligated to feed other people's family. She made a polite response when they came, which shows consideration. The father's comment about not having a dinner planned is a red flag, maybe implying they rely on others. But the mom is protecting her resources. Her family's needs come first, especially with teenagers who eat a lot. Limiting the visits is a reasonable boundary after the incident.\n\nShe didn't act out of malice. She's being practical. The father's response was probably passive-aggressive, but the mom's actions are justified. She's not in the wrong here. So answer B.\n"
