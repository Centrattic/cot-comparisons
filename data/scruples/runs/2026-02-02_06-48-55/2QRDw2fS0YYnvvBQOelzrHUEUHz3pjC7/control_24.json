Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom is cooking a lot for her own kids and when a friend of her son, Chris, comes over with his family unexpectedly, she doesn't feed them because she didn't prepare for them. She's now feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking for three kids, which is a lot. She didn't know in advance that four more people would come. Her response was polite, saying she's sure their parents have dinner planned. Then when the father says \"not really,\" she suggests takeout and ushers them out. She later reduced the frequency of Chris coming over.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she wasn't obligated to feed them. They came without notice, and she didn't have the food ready. Her reaction was firm but not rude. She's managing her household and resources. The father's response was dismissive, which might explain the mom's firmness. She's also adjusting future interactions to avoid similar situations. It's a matter of hospitality versus personal limits. Since they came uninvited and in a large number, she's within her rights to set boundaries. So probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
