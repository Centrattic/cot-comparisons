Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom did the right thing by not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family. \n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. Chris comes over, and she's okay feeding him. Then Chris's family shows up unannounced, and she didn't prepare for them. The parents said they weren't planning dinner, so she suggested takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here. Was she obligated to feed them? Well, they showed up uninvited, right? Her initial plan was to feed Chris, but four more people wasn't part of the arrangement. The parents didn't ask ahead of time, so maybe she's justified in not expecting them. \n\nBut then, when they came, she tried to be polite. She said she's sure they have dinner planned, and when they said no, she suggested takeout. That seems like she's trying to be helpful without overextending herself. She didn't refuse them food entirely, just redirected them to get their own. \n\nThe question of whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, they're in a financial situation where they might need help, but the mom is managing her resources for her own family. It's not like she turned them away hungry; she gave them options. Also, she's limiting future interactions to avoid similar situations, which makes sense for her family's well-being. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely, set boundaries, and it's reasonable to prioritize her household. The parents should have communicated if they needed to bring more people. The mom isn't responsible for their last-minute decision to bring extra guests. So, B.\n"
