Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a mom with three kids, and she's often cooking a lot because they eat a lot. Then Chris, a friend of her son, comes over sometimes, and she's okay with feeding him. But one day, Chris's entire family showed up unexpectedly, including his parents and two siblings. They were on the doorstep, one of them needed the bathroom, and they commented on the nice smells. The author didn't cook for them, and when the family said they weren't really planning dinner, the author told them to get takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting down the number of times Chris visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: she's a busy mom, cooking for her own family, and Chris is already coming over a lot. Suddenly, four more people show up unannounced, which she wasn't prepared for. She had no prior warning that the entire family would come. She tried to be polite but made it clear they weren't part of the dinner plans. Her response was to suggest takeout and send them on their way, which seems reasonable given the situation. She also adjusted her behavior afterward by limiting Chris's visits, which shows she's considering the situation to avoid future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have expected that if they came to pick him up, they could stay for dinner, especially if the author was feeding Chris. The parents might have been in a difficult situation, perhaps not having dinner planned, and thought it would be okay. The author's refusal could be seen as not offering help when they might need it. However, the author wasn't aware of the family's situation beforehand and didn't have time to prepare. The parents did say \"not really\" when asked if they had dinner planned, but the author already had her own family's needs in mind.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior notice, the author's own family's needs, and the sudden influx of unexpected guests. While the author could have offered a meal if she had known in advance or had the means, she was caught off guard. Her response was to send them away, which might be seen as harsh in some contexts, but given the circumstances, she had to make a quick decision to manage her own household's needs.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong because she wasn't prepared for four extra people and had to act in the interest of her own family. She also communicated politely and didn't make the situation worse. However, there's a sense that maybe she could have been more accommodating, but considering the context\u2014unexpected visitors, no prior notice\u2014it's understandable she felt she had to send them away. So I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
