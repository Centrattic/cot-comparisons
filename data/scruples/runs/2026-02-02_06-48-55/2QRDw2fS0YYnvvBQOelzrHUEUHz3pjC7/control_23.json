Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding the four extra people who showed up unannounced. The situation is that Chris and his family came over without prior notice, and the mom had only prepared for her own family plus Chris. She politely told them she wasn't cooking for them and suggested takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her responsibilities. She's a mom of three kids, which is a lot to manage. Cooking for a large family is time-consuming and expensive. She's already feeding her own kids and Chris regularly, which she mentions happens four times a week. Suddenly having four more visitors without notice would be a significant burden, especially if she didn't have the food or budget for it.\n\nThen, the family's response. The father said they didn't have dinner planned, which might indicate they were expecting her to feed them. But that's a big assumption. It's not reasonable to expect someone to feed a large group on short notice unless it's prearranged. The mom made it clear she hadn't planned for them, and she tried to be polite by suggesting takeout. She even ushered them out because the kids were getting hungry.\n\nBut maybe the issue is social expectations. In some cultures, offering food to guests is expected, even if it's last minute. However, in the US, where this scenario seems to be taking place, while hospitality is valued, there's also an understanding that people can't always accommodate unexpected guests, especially without notice. The mom did her best to be polite while setting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the son might need to communicate better with Chris about the impact of his family's visits. The mom is adjusting her son's social plans to avoid similar situations, which is understandable to protect her family's resources and peace of mind.\n\nIs the mom in the wrong? She didn't have the obligation to feed them, especially without prior notice. She handled the situation as best as she could, trying to be polite. The family made an assumption that might not have been fair. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
