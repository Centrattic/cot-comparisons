Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation she described. The story is about a mom who's feeding her son's friend Chris when he comes over. Then, one day Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly, and the author didn't prepare for them. She politely told them her parents didn't have dinner planned and suggested takeout, then kind of ushered them out. Now she's feeling conflicted because she doesn't want to be an asshole but also doesn't want to deal with last-minute guests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a mother of three kids, so her time and resources are already stretched thin. She's cooking a lot as it is for her own family. When Chris comes over, she's happy to feed him, which is generous. But when his entire family shows up unannounced, planning for four extra people would be a big ask, especially if it's not prearranged. She didn't cook for them, so her response was to say that the parents probably had a plan and suggested takeout. That makes sense because she didn't have food ready for them. \n\nHowever, the father said \"not really\" and looked away, which might imply that they were in a tough spot. The author then suggested takeout and ushered them out. The problem here is whether she was rude or if she handled it appropriately. She tried to be polite, but maybe she could have offered something else, like a snack or a drink, to be more hospitable. But she was already managing her own family's meals and wasn't expecting four extra people. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate that. Is it fair to expect her to accommodate four unexpected guests when she wasn't prepared? Probably not. She was already helping by feeding Chris when he came. The family showed up without notice, so she wasn't obligated to feed them. However, maybe she could have been more gracious, even if she couldn't offer a full meal. But in the situation, she did try to be diplomatic and offered takeout as an alternative. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is being unfair to Chris's family because they're in a financial hardship. But the author's situation is also a valid one\u2014she's a busy mother managing her own family's needs. She's not being cruel; she's just setting boundaries. The fact that she continued to feed Chris but reduced the frequency shows she's being considerate but also protecting her own capacity. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She handled an unexpected situation within her means, tried to be polite, and set boundaries. The father's response might have been a bit dismissive, but she did what she could without overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
