Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not feeding the additional family members when they came over unannounced. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family arrives unexpectedly, bringing four more people, she wasn't prepared. She tried to politely send them away, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are about hospitality, expectations, and boundaries. The author wasn't expecting four extra people, so she didn't cook for them. She politely suggested they get takeout and left. The father's response was noncommittal, but the author still had to deal with the situation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She might not have the means or the time to accommodate last-minute guests, especially since they weren't invited. Her actions were to protect her family's meal time. However, from the other side, someone in need might feel that the author didn't offer help when they needed it.\n\nBut the author didn't refuse to feed them in a hostile way. She was polite and suggested an alternative. She also adjusted her son's social plans afterward to avoid similar situations. That shows she's trying to manage the situation respectfully.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she was honest about her inability to accommodate and handled it politely. People can't be expected to feed every uninvited guest, especially without prior notice. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
