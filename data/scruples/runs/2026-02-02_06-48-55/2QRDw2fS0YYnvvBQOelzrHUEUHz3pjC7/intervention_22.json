Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's parents and siblings showed up unannounced, she didn't cook extra and sent them away. She later reduced Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is about whether she did the right thing. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't expect four extra people. She politely suggested they get takeout. She's a parent with her own responsibilities. Maybe she's not obligated to feed them. Also, she's concerned about future visits because of the stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might be in a tough situation financially. The parents might not have been able to prepare a meal. The mom's response could be seen as dismissive, even if she was polite. Some might argue that she should have offered something, even if it wasn't a full meal. Maybe a snack or inviting them to wait while she prepared something simple.\n\nBut she did offer takeout and urged them to leave because the kids were hungry. That shows she was trying to manage her own family's needs. She's not required to host them, especially without prior notice. The fact that she's a mom with three kids might mean her resources are already stretched thin. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might expect some level of hospitality, but it's also reasonable to set boundaries. The mom is within her rights to prioritize her own family. However, some might feel that she could have been more accommodating given the family's financial situation. \n\nI think the key points are the unexpectedness of the visit and the mom's responsibility to her own household. While there's a kindness aspect, she's not in the wrong for not extending her resources beyond what she can manage. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
