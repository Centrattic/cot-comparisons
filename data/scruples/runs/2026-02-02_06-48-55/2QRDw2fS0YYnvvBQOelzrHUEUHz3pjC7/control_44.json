Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up.\n\nFirst, she's a single mom with three kids, so her time and resources are already stretched. She's cooking a lot for her own family. Chris comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family arrives unannounced, she's not prepared for four more people. She tries to be polite, maybe even offering takeout, but ends up sending them away. \n\nThe key points here are the suddenness of the visit and the fact that she hadn't prepared for extra guests. She's not in the habit of feeding large groups, especially on short notice. Her response to the parents' comment about not having dinner planned seems reasonable. She's protecting her own family's resources and her ability to manage her household. \n\nBut then she reduces Chris's visits, which might affect their relationship. However, she's also setting boundaries to prevent future stress. There's no indication she was rude or mean to the family. She was diplomatic and tried to be helpful with the takeout suggestion. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have offered something simple if she had the means. But given the situation, she's a single parent who might be stretched thin. The family's arrival was unexpected, so it's not her fault they showed up without warning. She's in a position where she can't just magically feed more people without prior notice. \n\nThe mom's actions seem justified. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her family's needs and setting boundaries. The problem was the sudden influx of guests, not her response. So the answer should be B.\n"
