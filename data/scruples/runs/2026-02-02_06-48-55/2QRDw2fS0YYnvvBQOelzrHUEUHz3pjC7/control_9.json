Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the mom not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The mom has three kids and is already cooking a lot. Chris's family, including two parents and two siblings, came to pick up Chris. The family was hungry and wanted to eat, but the mom hadn't prepared for them. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout. Then she reduced the number of times Chris comes over.\n\nThe user wants to know if the mom did something wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFrom the mom's viewpoint, she's managing her own household, cooking for her kids, and suddenly has four extra people. She might feel that it's not her responsibility to feed them, especially if she didn't know they were coming. She's being polite but setting boundaries. She's also adjusting the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nFrom the other side, Chris's family might feel that coming to pick up their son and being offered food is reasonable, especially if they're not well-off. The mom's response could be seen as dismissive. However, the mom didn't have prior notice, and it's not her obligation to feed them. Her comment about takeout and ushering them out might be necessary to protect her family's needs.\n\nLegally and socially, people aren't obligated to host others or provide meals unless there's an agreement. The mom tried to be diplomatic. Her actions were to set a boundary, which is her right. However, some might argue that it's harsh to not offer any food when they're in a vulnerable position. But since they didn't ask for food and she hadn't prepared it, her response is understandable.\n\nThe mother's decision to limit Chris's visits is practical to prevent future issues. It's about managing her own household's resources. So, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
