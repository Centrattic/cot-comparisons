Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the mom of three kids who's cooking a lot already. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, which she's okay with because she's happy to feed one more. But then Chris's parents and siblings show up unexpectedly. The family comments on the nice house and food, and when they mention being hungry, the mom tries to politely decline by saying they'll get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting down visits from her son's friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mom is already cooking a lot for her own kids. Chris's family shows up unannounced, and she didn't plan for four extra people. She tried to handle it diplomatically, but the parents didn't seem to have dinner plans. She felt it was necessary to limit future visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about the ethical aspects. On one hand, she's a busy mom managing her own household and resources. It's understandable that she didn't prepare for additional guests. She tried to be polite and even suggested takeout, which is a reasonable solution. On the other hand, Chris's family is in a difficult financial situation, and maybe they rely on others for meals. Refusing them might seem harsh, especially if they were genuinely in need.\n\nBut the key here is that Chris's family showed up unannounced. The mom didn't invite them, and she had no prior knowledge. She was already cooking for her own family. It's important to consider that she's not obligated to feed strangers or unexpected guests. The parents of Chris might have expected her to accommodate, but that's a stretch. She handled it as politely as possible without being rude.\n\nHowever, the mom's decision to limit Chris's visits might affect the child's social life. But she's making a choice based on her own household's needs. The fact that she's trying to be diplomatic (saying they'll get takeout) shows she's trying to be helpful without overstepping. The parents' response of \"not really\" when asked about their dinner plans could imply they expected her to host, which is not fair.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the mom is not in the wrong. She's managing her own resources and family's needs. The other family's actions (showing up uninvited) might be the issue here. The mom's response was appropriate given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
