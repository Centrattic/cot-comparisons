Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. She's feeding Chris, a friend of her son who isn't well off, which is generous. But then, without prior notice, Chris's family shows up unannounced with two siblings. They're all on the doorstep, and the family comments on the food smell and how hungry they are. The mom didn't plan for them, so she politely tells them that maybe their parents have dinner planned, but the dad says \"not really.\" She then suggests takeout and ushers them out.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user believes she is, but I need to decide. First, the mom didn't know they were coming. She was only expecting Chris. The family showed up uninvited, which can be unexpected. She was polite, tried to be diplomatic, and when the dad didn't provide an alternative, she had to set boundaries. She's a single parent with three teens, so managing her household is already a lot. She's not obligated to feed people she didn't plan for. Maybe the issue is that she didn't offer food even though they were hungry? But she didn't plan for them. If they showed up and she had extra, maybe she could offer, but if she didn't, then she's not in the wrong. Also, she's setting boundaries to prevent future unannounced visits. That's reasonable. The family might have been in need, but the mom has her family's needs too. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
