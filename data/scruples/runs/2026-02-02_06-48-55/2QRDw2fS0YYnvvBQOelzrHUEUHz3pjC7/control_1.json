Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the mom is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, she's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, including two siblings and parents, she wasn't prepared for four extra people. She tried to politely redirect them, mentioning that maybe takeout is better. Then she reduced the number of visits from four to one per week for Chris.\n\nThe key points here are her responsibility to her own family and the unexpected guests. She didn't cook for four more people. She tried to handle it diplomatically but ended up feeling conflicted. The father said they weren't having dinner, which complicates things. \n\nI need to consider if she was in the wrong. She didn't invite them, and they showed up. She was already cooking for her family. It's reasonable to not want to feed unexpected guests, especially since their family situation might not be ideal. Her response was firm but polite. She also adjusted the frequency of visits to prevent future issues. \n\nIs it her fault they came unprepared? Probably not. She didn't have an obligation to feed them. Maybe the parents should have arranged to feed their kids elsewhere. The fact that she's trying to balance her family's needs makes sense. So, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
