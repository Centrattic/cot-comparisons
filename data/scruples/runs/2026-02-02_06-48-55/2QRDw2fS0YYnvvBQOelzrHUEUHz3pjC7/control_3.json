Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing in this situation. She has three kids, and she's been feeding Chris, a friend of her son. Then Chris's family showed up unexpectedly, and she didn't want to feed them all. She tried to politely send them away. Now she's feeling guilty but also justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking a lot for her own family. Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his whole family shows up without notice, she's not prepared. She responded politely but made it clear she wasn't going to feed them. \n\nThe father's response was \"not really\" and looked away. The mom then suggested takeout and ushered them out. She later reduced the number of visits. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she was hosting Chris, maybe expecting just him. His family appearing without being invited or notified could be a surprise. She didn't cook for four extra people. Her response seems reasonable. She tried to be polite but set boundaries. \n\nHowever, maybe she could have offered something more, like a snack or a simple meal, even if it wasn't a full dinner. But she's already managing a lot for her own kids. The family's situation is not her fault, but she has to manage her own resources. \n\nThe key here is whether she was obligated to feed them. Since they showed up unannounced and she wasn't prepared, her reaction is understandable. She's not being cruel, just setting limits. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any cultural expectations or other factors. Maybe in some views, hosting guests is expected, but she wasn't the one who invited them. So B makes sense.\n"
