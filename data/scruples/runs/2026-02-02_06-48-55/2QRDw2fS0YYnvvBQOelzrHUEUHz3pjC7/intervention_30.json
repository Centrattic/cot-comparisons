Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mom has two teenagers and a preteen, which means she's already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But then Chris's family showed up unexpectedly\u2014parents and two siblings. They came to pick up Chris, but while there, the family members mentioned they were hungry and wanted to eat. The author didn't cook for them, and when the dad said they weren't planning on having dinner, the mom suggested takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted because she told her son to cut back on Chris's visits or go to his house instead to avoid this happening again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's point of view is that she's a mom managing a household with her own kids, and unexpected guests can disrupt that. She didn't plan to feed four extra people, so her reaction was to send them away and limit future visits. On the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a tough spot financially, and the parents might have been trying to get a meal for their kids.\n\nBut wait, the parents came to pick up Chris. They were there for a purpose, not just to get a meal. The comment about the food smelling good and the sibling saying they were hungry might have been innocent, but the author didn't have to feed them. However, when the dad said they weren't planning dinner, the author's response was a bit abrupt. Maybe she should have offered them something, even if it wasn't a full meal? Or maybe she's within her rights to say she wasn't prepared and sent them off. \n\nBut then again, considering the parents' financial situation, maybe they were trying to get a meal for their kids. If that's the case, the author's reaction could be seen as insensitive, even if she didn't plan for them. However, she did offer takeout as a solution, which was a kind gesture. But telling her son to limit visits or go to Chris's house might be a way to avoid future issues, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle: the parents didn't ask for food. They were just there to pick up their son. The kids might have been commenting on the food, but the parents didn't ask for anything. The author could have politely said she wasn't ready but maybe offered a snack or something. But she didn't cook for four people. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she wasn't responsible for feeding them. However, the way she sent them away might have been harsh, especially if they were in a tight situation.\n\nAlso, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. She did what she could, maybe. She's managing her own household. But maybe she could have been more understanding. The key points are that the family didn't ask for food, but their comments might have been read as an unspoken request. However, the parents didn't make that explicit. So the author might not be in the wrong because she wasn't obligated to feed them. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents were in a situation where they couldn't provide dinner, maybe the author could have offered something small. But she didn't cook for four people. The father said they weren't planning dinner, so the author suggested takeout. That's a practical solution. Then she decided to limit future visits, which is her right as a parent.\n\nSo weighing all this, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation by suggesting takeout and then taking steps to prevent future issues. She's a parent managing her own household, and it's not her responsibility to feed another family unexpectedly. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
