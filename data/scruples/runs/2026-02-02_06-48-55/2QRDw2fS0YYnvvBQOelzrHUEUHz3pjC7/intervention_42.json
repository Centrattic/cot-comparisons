Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer, but I need to think through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a mom taking care of her own kids, and she often feeds Chris, the son's friend. Now, when Chris's family came over, they just showed up unannounced, and the author didn't plan to feed them. She told them she didn't cook for them, suggesting they go get takeout. Then she reduced the number of times Chris visits because she doesn't want to deal with unexpected family visitors again.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She's a busy mom with teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking for her own family and the friend Chris, but not for Chris's family. She felt it was unfair to have four more people show up without notice. Her response was polite but set boundaries. She's trying to protect her own family's needs and not be taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough financial situation. They might not have the means to provide a good meal, especially if they were hungry. The father said they \"not really\" have a dinner planned, which could imply they're struggling. The author's reaction might come off as dismissive or classist, even if she's not intending to be. By suggesting takeout and then cutting back on Chris's visits, she might be punishing him for his family's situation, which could hurt his feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't invite them. They showed up unannounced. The author wasn't prepared. She politely declined to feed them, which is reasonable. She's not obligated to feed people who just drop by. Her concern is about managing her own household and not having to accommodate unexpected guests. The problem is whether her reaction was appropriate.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have a reasonable expectation to not have unexpected guests? Yes. She didn't cook for them, so her response was to suggest takeout, which they could choose. She didn't refuse to feed them entirely; she just wasn't prepared. The issue is the subsequent decision to limit Chris's visits. That might be more about avoiding future situations where the same thing happens. \n\nIs it fair to limit Chris's visits because of his family's circumstances? That could be seen as unfair, especially if Chris is unaware of his family's behavior. The author is projecting her discomfort onto Chris, which isn't his fault. However, the initial interaction where she declined to feed the four people was a valid boundary. The problem is the punitive action taken afterward.\n\nSo, where's the line? The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries with unexpected guests. But punishing the child for his family's actions might be. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong overall. If the initial refusal was justified, but the follow-up actions were not, then maybe she's partially at fault. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong overall.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often consider both intentions and actions. The author's intention was to protect her family's resources, which is understandable. Her actions were to politely decline and then reduce visits, which might be seen as overreacting or being classist. \n\nI think there's a valid argument on both sides. The author isn't wrong for not expecting to feed four unannounced guests. However, her follow-up of reducing Chris's visits could be seen as unfair. So depending on how you weigh those aspects, the answer might vary. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong for the initial refusal but is for the subsequent actions. But since the question is about the entire situation, including the follow-up, the answer could be yes or no.\n\nAlternatively, if the main issue is the initial refusal, then she's not in the wrong. If the main issue is the punitive action against Chris, then maybe she is. But the problem is the entire scenario. Considering the AITA community often judges based on perceived fairness, the author might be seen as in the right because she wasn't obligated to feed them, but her actions after might be seen as unfair. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong overall. I'm leaning towards \"B\" (not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to manage her household and set boundaries, even if the follow-up was harsh. But maybe others see it as classism. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
