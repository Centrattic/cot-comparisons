Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the scenario: She has three kids, including a son with a friend Chris who visits often. Chris's family came over unexpectedly, and the mom didn't prepare extra food. When they mentioned being hungry, she told them to get takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted because she's cutting down visits to avoid this situation again.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. She's responsible for feeding her own family, which is a lot already. Chris's family showed up unannounced without prior notice, which could have been a logistical issue for the mom. She didn't cook for them, and when the father said they didn't have a dinner planned, she suggested takeout and sent them away.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's doing her best to manage her household. She didn't expect four extra people and might not have the resources or time to accommodate them. Her response was polite but firm, and she adjusted her son's social plans to prevent future surprises. That seems reasonable. She's not obligated to feed others, especially without prior notice. It's her home and her rules.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation that when someone's family is in a tough spot, others should help out. But the mom didn't know they were in a bad financial situation, and Chris's family didn't ask for help directly. They just mentioned being hungry after commenting on the food smell. The mom's response was to let them know she wasn't responsible for their meal, which is within her rights.\n\nI think the key here is that the mom isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation as best as she could given the circumstances. She was diplomatic and didn't want to create a pattern of unexpected guests. Her decision to limit visits to avoid similar issues is a personal choice to protect her own family's needs. So the answer is B.\n"
