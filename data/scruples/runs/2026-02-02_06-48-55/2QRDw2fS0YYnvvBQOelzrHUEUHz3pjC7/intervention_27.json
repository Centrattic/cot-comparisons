Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. The situation is that Chris, a friend of her son, comes over often, but when his family came to pick him up, they stayed and the mom didn't offer to feed them. She then reduced the frequency of Chris coming over.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The mom is already cooking for her own teenagers and a preteen, which is a lot. When Chris's family showed up unannounced, she didn't prepare for them. She tried to politely decline by saying her parents would have dinner planned, but the dad said they didn't. She then told them to get takeout and sent them away. Now she feels conflicted because she's worried about being an asshole but also doesn't want to be burdened with unexpected guests.\n\nThe key points here are about hospitality, expectations, and boundaries. The mom is managing her household and has already decided to feed Chris. However, when his entire family showed up without notice, she wasn't prepared. It's important to consider whether she had a responsibility to feed them. Since they were just picking up Chris, their presence was unexpected. She might not be obligated to feed them, especially if she wasn't informed in advance. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might have had an unspoken expectation to be fed, especially if they were invited before. But the mom didn't know they were coming. She tried to handle it politely, which shows she's considerate. However, the father's response that they didn't have dinner planned might have been a plea, but the mom stood her ground. \n\nThe mom's decision to limit Chris's visits to reduce the possibility of more unexpected guests seems practical. She's protecting her own family's needs. In many cultures, there's an expectation to feed guests, but if the guests arrive without notice, the host isn't necessarily at fault. The mom did what she could to manage the situation without overextending herself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a decision that prioritizes her family's well-being. The answer would be B.\n"
