Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe mom has three kids: two teenagers and a preteen. They eat a lot, so she's cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, isn't well-off and comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But then Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly\u2014parents and two siblings. They were just there to pick him up, but they start commenting on the nice smells and how hungry they are. The mom tries to politely say that their parents probably have dinner planned, but the dad says \"not really.\" She then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's cut down the visits from four to one a week and suggested maybe meeting elsewhere.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the perspective of the mom. She's already managing a household with three teenagers who eat a lot. She's already feeding Chris, who's a regular visitor. When Chris's family shows up unannounced, it's a surprise. She didn't cook for four extra people. Her response was to suggest takeout and send them on their way. She's concerned about her family's needs and the unexpected burden. Her follow-up action is reducing the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid future situations. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a tough spot. The dad didn't have dinner planned, so they might have been desperate. The mom's reaction could be seen as dismissive or not empathetic. However, she was in a position where she wasn't expecting guests and had to manage her resources. \n\nIs it fair to expect her to feed everyone? Maybe not, especially since it was a last-minute situation. She tried to be polite and offered a solution (takeout), which could be a way to help without overextending. However, the way she ushered them out might have been abrupt. \n\nAlso, the mom's concern about future visits is valid if she doesn't want to be in that situation again. It's her home, and she has the right to set boundaries. But maybe there's a middle ground, like offering a snack or something quick if they needed it.\n\nThe key points here are empathy vs. personal boundaries. The mom might be right to protect her resources and her family's needs, but she could have been more understanding of the family's situation. However, given that it was unexpected and she wasn't prepared, her actions might be justifiable. \n\nI think it's a bit of a nuanced situation. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether her actions were overly harsh or if they were reasonable. Since she tried to be polite, offered an alternative (takeout), and it was a last-minute situation, I lean towards her not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
