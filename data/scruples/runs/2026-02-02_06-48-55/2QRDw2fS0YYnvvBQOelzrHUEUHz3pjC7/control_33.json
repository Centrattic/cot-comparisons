Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has three kids, which already means she's cooking a lot. She's feeding her son's friend Chris regularly, which she's okay with. Then Chris's family comes over, four more people. She didn't expect them and hadn't prepared for them. The family members mention they're hungry, but she politely tells them she hasn't cooked for them and suggests takeout. Then she ushers them out. After that, she decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she had no prior notice. She's managing her family's meals, which is a lot already. It's reasonable that she didn't prepare for four extra people. She did respond politely, suggesting takeout and encouraging them to leave since they were hungry. She didn't refuse to feed them entirely but redirected them to get food themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some might feel that she was abrupt, especially since they are in a lower financial situation. But she's not obligated to feed them, especially when it's a last-minute situation. She did try to be diplomatic. The father's response about not really having dinner planned adds context\u2014maybe they were expecting her to feed them? But that's a big assumption. \n\nThe mom's reaction seems reasonable. She's managing her household and resources. Limiting visits to avoid similar situations isn't unreasonable either. People might have different opinions, but legally or morally, she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely and offered an alternative. So the answer is probably B.\n"
