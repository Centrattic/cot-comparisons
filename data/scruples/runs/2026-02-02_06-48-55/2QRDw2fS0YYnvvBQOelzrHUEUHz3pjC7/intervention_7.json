Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a mom who's feeding her kids and occasionally feeding a friend of her son, Chris. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, she doesn't want to feed them because she hadn't prepared for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The mom is already cooking for her own three kids, which is a lot. Chris comes over a lot, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family shows up without notice, she's not prepared. She tries to handle it diplomatically by suggesting they go get takeout. Then she decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mom is managing her household and resources. She didn't expect guests and might not have the capacity to feed more people. It's understandable she's stressed, especially with teenagers' appetites. Her response was polite, I think. She didn't make them stay or insult them. She offered takeout and moved them along. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation that if you invite a kid over, you should also feed their family if they arrive. But the mom didn't invite the family, right? Chris's parents just showed up. So she's not obligated to feed them. The parents even said they weren't planning dinner, which might imply they expected the host to take responsibility, but that's a bit presumptuous. \n\nThe mom's reaction of reducing Chris's visits is a bit harsh, maybe. But she's protecting her family's resources. It's her home, and she has the right to set boundaries. She didn't treat the family poorly; she was polite but firm. \n\nSo I think she's not in the wrong. The family showed up uninvited and might have overstepped, expecting to be fed without being asked. The mom acted in her family's best interest. Answer B.\n"
