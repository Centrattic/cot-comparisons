Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a scenario where a mom is hosting a friend's family unexpectedly and ends up declining to feed them, then reducing the visits. The user thinks the mom is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The mom has three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. The son's friend Chris comes over often, and the mom is okay with feeding one more. Then Chris's family shows up unannounced with four people. The parents didn't call ahead, and the family comments on being hungry. The mom tries to politely suggest they get takeout and send them away. After, she limits Chris's visits.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and hospitality. The mom is responsible for her family's meals, and the sudden influx of four unexpected guests could be a burden. She didn't cook for them, which is understandable since they arrived without notice. Her response was to suggest takeout and send them on their way, which is a way to be polite while maintaining her household's routine. Then she decides to limit Chris's visits to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't have to feed them. She tried to be diplomatic. The family came without notice, which is a factor. The mom's actions seem reasonable from her perspective. She's protecting her family's resources and time. However, some might argue that she could have offered something, even if she didn't plan for it. But given the circumstances, she didn't have to. People in need might not always call ahead, but the mom isn't obligated to host them. Her decision to limit visits is about setting boundaries, which is her right. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
