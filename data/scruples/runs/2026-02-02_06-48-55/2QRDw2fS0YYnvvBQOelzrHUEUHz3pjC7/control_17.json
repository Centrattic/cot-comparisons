Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in this situation is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the scenario.\n\nThe mom has three kids, two teenagers and one preteen. They eat a lot, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, isn't well-off and comes over often. She's okay feeding him. Then Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly\u2014parents and two siblings. They're on the doorstep, one uses the bathroom, comments on the nice smell of food. The mom didn't cook for four extra people. She says she's sure they have a nice dinner planned. The dad says \"not really\" and looks away. The mom then tells them to take out, maybe get moving. Later, she tells her son to limit Chris's visits or go to his house instead. She's conflicted\u2014feels she did the right thing but feels like an asshole.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. She invited Chris before, but this time the family came uninvited. She didn't have the food prepared. She tried to be polite but clearly wasn't expecting four extra people. She's a mom with three kids already, so the sudden guests would be a burden. Her response was to suggest takeout and usher them out. She's also trying to manage her resources and not be taken advantage of. On the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult situation financially, but they didn't ask. The mom didn't necessarily refuse food, but she made it clear she wasn't prepared. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, hosting guests can be a delicate balance. The mom is within her rights to manage her own household and resources. She didn't act aggressively, just set boundaries. However, some might see it as not being generous enough. But considering the context of her own responsibilities and the uninvited, last-minute guests, her actions seem reasonable. She's protecting her family's needs. The answer is probably B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
