Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. So, the author is a mom with three kids, and she's already cooking a lot for her own family. Chris is a friend of her son, and he comes over often. She's been feeding him. Then last week, Chris's parents and siblings came to pick him up. They were on the doorstep, one kid needed the bathroom, and they commented on how nice the house smells. The family mentioned they were hungry. The author responded by saying she didn't cook for them and suggested takeout. The father said they weren't really planning dinner. She told them to get moving since the kids were hungry. Now she's telling her son to limit Chris's visits or have him meet elsewhere.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. She's a busy mom with teenagers who eat a lot. She didn't cook for four extra people. She had to manage her own family's meals. When the family showed up unannounced, she had no prior notice. She tried to be polite but firm. She might not have the resources or time to accommodate them. Her reaction was to send them away because she couldn't feed them. She's also adjusting her son's social interactions to avoid future situations.\n\nFrom the other side, Chris's family might be in a situation where they don't have food at home. The parents might be struggling financially. They came to pick up their son, which is reasonable, but they ended up expecting a meal? The parents didn't bring food, and when they said they weren't planning dinner, the author was in a tough spot. \n\nBut maybe the author could have offered something simple, like a snack or a shared meal, but she didn't plan for four extra people. She might not have the means. It's also possible that the parents expected a meal as part of the visit, but it's not clear if that's a cultural norm or if they were overly demanding. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as necessary for her family's well-being. She's a single mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. She's trying to manage resources. On the other hand, turning away someone in need might be seen as heartless, but the family wasn't in her house for a meal; they just turned up and started expecting food. It's a tricky situation. \n\nIn the end, the author did what she could to be polite but firm. She didn't want to repeat the situation, so she's adjusting her son's interactions. I think the key here is that the author didn't have prior notice and couldn't prepare for four extra people. She's in a position where she's managing a lot already. So, from that angle, she's not in the wrong because she wasn't at fault for not anticipating the visit.\n"
