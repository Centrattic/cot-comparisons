Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mother did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. She was already cooking for her own kids and hadn't planned for four more. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot is part of her routine. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him when he visits. But then Chris's family comes over without notice, bringing four more people. The family comments on the food and how hungry they are. The mom tries to be polite but says she didn't plan for them and suggests they get takeout. Then she reduces the number of visits.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's responsible for her own household's meals. She didn't know the family was coming, so expecting her to feed them without prior notice might be unfair. She tried to be polite, even offered a solution (takeout), and set boundaries after the incident. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have been more accommodating, but she's a single parent with three teens. The family's situation is mentioned as not well off, but that doesn't mean the mother has to host them. She's not obligated to feed them on short notice. The father's response was nonchalant, so maybe they didn't expect her to cook but just wanted to eat her food. \n\nThe key points here: Did she have prior notice? No. Did she make it clear she wasn't prepared? Yes. Did she push them out? Maybe a bit abrupt, but she had a valid reason. The boundaries she's setting now to prevent future issues make sense. \n\nSo I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
