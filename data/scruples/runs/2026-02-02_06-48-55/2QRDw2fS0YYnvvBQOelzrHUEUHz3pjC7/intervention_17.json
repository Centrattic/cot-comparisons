Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the mom of three kids often feeds Chris, a friend of her son. But when Chris's family unexpectedly shows up, she declines to feed them, leading to her feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions she's cooking a lot for her own kids, and Chris comes over often. She's happy to feed him, but when his family arrives unannounced, she's not prepared for four more people. She tries to politely decline, but the father says they aren't really prepared either. The mom then insists they leave, and later reduces Chris's visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is managing her resources for her own family. Unexpected guests can be a burden, especially when finances and planning are involved. She made an effort to be polite, suggesting takeout, but the family was still uncooperative. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries to protect her household.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might be in a difficult financial situation. The author's response could be seen as dismissive, even if she's not obligated to feed them. However, she wasn't aware of the family's situation when she invited Chris. The key point is whether she was responsible for feeding them. Since it was an unexpected, last-minute request, she's not in the wrong for not accommodating. She handled it politely and even offered an alternative. Her decision to limit Chris's visits is about managing her own home, not a direct wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's within her rights to protect her family's resources and set boundaries. The situation is about personal choice and circumstances, not a moral failing.\n"
