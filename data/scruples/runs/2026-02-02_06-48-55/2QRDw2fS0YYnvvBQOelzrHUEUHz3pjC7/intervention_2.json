Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a mom feeding her kids and a friend of her son, but when the friend's family shows up unannounced, she doesn't feed them and then reduces the friend's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. She's a mom with three kids to feed, and she's already cooking a lot. When the friend's family arrives unexpectedly with four people, she wasn't prepared for that. She tried to be polite, but it's clear she didn't want to feed them. Her actions were to protect her own family's needs and her resources. \n\nNow, the other side: Chris's family might be in a tough spot financially. The father mentioned they don't have a nice dinner planned, which could be a real issue. The author's response of suggesting takeout quickly and then cutting down visits might seem harsh, especially if the family is struggling. But the author isn't in a position to provide regular meals to others, especially without prior notice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she did the best she could under the circumstances. She didn't invite the family, they arrived unannounced, and she handled it politely. She also adjusted by limiting future visits, which is reasonable. On the other hand, maybe she could have offered something small if she was willing, but she wasn't prepared. The key here is that she's prioritizing her own family's needs, which is natural. The father's comment about not having a nice dinner might be a red flag, but the author isn't responsible for their situation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's managing her household and resources. She didn't have to feed them, especially with no notice. Her response was appropriate to her situation. So the answer is B.\n"
