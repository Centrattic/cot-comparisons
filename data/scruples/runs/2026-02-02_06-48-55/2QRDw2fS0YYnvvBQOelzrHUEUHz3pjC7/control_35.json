Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing in not feeding Chris' family when they showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and now his parents and siblings show up unexpectedly. She hadn't planned for four extra people, so she politely tells them she's not feeding them and sends them on their way. After that, she limits Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nHmm. I need to consider if she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't know they were coming, so it's understandable she didn't cook for them. She even offered takeout as an alternative, which is a way to be helpful without feeding them directly. Her reaction seems practical, given the unexpected guests.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family was in a tough spot. If they don't have enough food, politely declining might be seen as harsh. But the father said they weren't planning a dinner, so maybe they were expecting her to cover them? However, it's not her responsibility to feed them if they didn't communicate their needs in advance. She's under no obligation to feed someone else's family without notice.\n\nAlso, she's taking steps to prevent future issues by reducing the frequency of Chris's visits. That's her right to manage her time and resources. The key points are that she didn't plan for the extra people, she handled the situation politely, and she's adjusting her actions to avoid similar situations. \n\nI think she's not in the wrong. She's being reasonable and setting boundaries, which is important for any household. People can't be expected to feed others without prior notice, especially when it's impacting their own family's needs.\n"
