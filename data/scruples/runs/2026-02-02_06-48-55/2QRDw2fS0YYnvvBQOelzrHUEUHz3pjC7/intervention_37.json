Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother did something wrong by not feeding Chris's entire family when they unexpectedly showed up. She had planned for Chris but not the rest of his family. The situation involves her teenagers and preteen, who eat a lot, and she's already cooking a lot as it is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She mentioned that Chris visits often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family came over without prior notice, she wasn't prepared for four additional people. Her response was polite but firm, suggesting takeout and urging them to leave because the kids were hungry. She later reduced Chris's visits to one per week to avoid similar situations.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't ask for them to come over, and they arrived without her knowing. She had a valid reason to not have food ready for them. Her reaction seems reasonable given that she's managing her household's needs. She didn't turn them away harshly; she offered a polite solution (takeout) and moved them along. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she could have been more accommodating, considering Chris's family's situation. But she's not obligated to feed people who showed up unannounced. The key here is the unexpected nature of their arrival and her existing responsibilities. Her decision to limit Chris's visits to prevent future issues shows she's trying to manage her resources and time effectively.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She acted in her family's best interest and managed the situation politely without being inconsiderate. The unexpected guests were a strain on her resources, and she took steps to avoid similar situations.\n"
