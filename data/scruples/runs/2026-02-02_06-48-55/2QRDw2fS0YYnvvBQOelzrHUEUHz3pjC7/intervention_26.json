Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom who didn't feed guests from her son's friend's family. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mom is a single parent with three kids. She's used to cooking for them, but when the friend's family (including the friend Chris) comes over, she didn't prepare for them. The parents of Chris came with two siblings, and even though they were hungry, she told them to get takeout and sent them away. She reduced the number of visits after that.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong. The user thinks she is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, she's a single mom managing a household. She didn't expect four extra people and wasn't prepared. It's reasonable that she didn't cook for them. Also, she's being polite but firm when she says they can get takeout. She's protecting her family's resources, which is her right.\n\nOn the other hand, the other family is in a financial situation where they might not have enough. The mom could have offered some food or made a small effort to help, maybe even a snack. By not doing so, she might have made them feel unwelcome. But she's not obligated to host them, especially without prior notice.\n\nThe key points are: Did she have a responsibility to feed them? Since they showed up unannounced with four people, expecting a meal might be unreasonable. However, being a guest in someone's home usually comes with some hospitality. The mom's response was to suggest takeout, which is a middle ground. She didn't refuse entirely but redirected them.\n\nAlso, the mom is adjusting her son's visits to avoid this situation. That shows she's trying to manage her resources and avoid similar stress. It's about boundaries. She's not wrong for setting boundaries, especially when she's the one providing the home and meals.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's managing her household and making decisions that prioritize her family's needs. The answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe cultural expectations of hospitality? But even then, unexpected guests can be a problem. The line is thin, but in this case, the mom handled it politely and practically. So the answer is B.\n"
