Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they came to pick him up. So the situation is that the mom usually feeds Chris when he comes over, but when his family arrived unexpectedly, she didn't offer to feed them. She had already prepared food for her own kids and maybe Chris, but not for four more people. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which already requires a lot of cooking. Chris comes over often, and she's been accommodating. But when his family showed up without notice, she didn't have the food ready. She tried to be diplomatic by suggesting maybe they should order takeout and then ushered them out. \n\nShe's feeling conflicted because she doesn't want to be mean, especially since poverty isn't Chris's fault. But she's also stressed about feeding more people than planned. The key points here are intent, communication, and whether there was an expectation of hospitality. \n\nThe mom didn't know Chris's family would come. She had already cooked for her own and maybe Chris. The family members themselves mentioned they were hungry, but the mom wasn't responsible for their visit. She tried to be polite but firm. \n\nIs she wrong for not feeding them? Well, she wasn't obligated to host them. Since the visit was unexpected and she wasn't prepared, it's reasonable she didn't have food for four extra people. Her response was to suggest takeout, which is a solution, but maybe she could have handled it differently. However, she didn't make them stay; she let them go. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have offered something simple or checked if they needed help. But she might have felt that accommodating them would be a burden. The question is whether her actions were inconsiderate. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal responsibility. Since the family came unannounced, she didn't have a duty to feed them. She tried to be polite but set a boundary. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
