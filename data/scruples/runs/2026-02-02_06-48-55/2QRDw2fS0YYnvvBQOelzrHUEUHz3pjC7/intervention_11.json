Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family who showed up unannounced. The author is a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot, and Chris is a friend of her son. The family came to pick up Chris, but then stayed around, and the parents indicated they didn't have dinner planned. The author tried to politely send them away, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's responsible for her own family's meals, has teenagers who eat a lot, and didn't prepare for extra guests. She tried to be diplomatic but had to set a boundary. On the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult financial situation, and the parents might have been in a bind. The author's response might have been seen as harsh, especially since she didn't refuse to feed them but instead suggested takeout and urged them to leave.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's fair. Was there an expectation that the author should feed the entire family? Or was the family just taking advantage of the situation? The key point here is whether the author had an obligation to feed them. Since the family didn't ask to stay for dinner and the author had no prior knowledge of their arrival, she might not be obligated. However, the parents' comment about not having dinner planned could imply an unspoken request for help, which the author didn't fulfill.\n\nBut the author did respond by suggesting takeout, which is a kind gesture. She didn't refuse outright; she just encouraged them to leave. So maybe she was right to set boundaries. The other side could argue that the family was in a vulnerable position and the author should have offered to help more, despite the inconvenience. However, the author has her own family to care for and can't be expected to provide for others without prior notice.\n\nAnother angle: the parents came to pick up their son, not to eat, so it's unreasonable to expect the author to feed them. The comment about the food smelling good was a casual observation, not a request. The author's response was appropriate in that context. She wasn't being rude, just firm. The parents' reply of \"not really\" might have been a challenge, but the author maintained her stance without confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She had a right to set boundaries for her household. The answer should be B (No).\n"
