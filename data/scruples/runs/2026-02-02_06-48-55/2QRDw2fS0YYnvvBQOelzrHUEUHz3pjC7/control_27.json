Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the mom in this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the details. She's a mom with three kids: two teenagers and one preteen. That means she's probably cooking a lot because teenagers and preteens have big appetites. Then there's Chris, her son's friend, who she mentions isn't too well off. Chris comes over often, like four times a week. The problem arises when Chris's parents and siblings come to pick him up and end up being on her doorstep.\n\nThe parents and siblings came to the door, and one of the siblings needed to use the bathroom. While they were there, they commented on how nice the house was and the food smelled. Then one sibling said they were hungry. The mom tried to politely decline by saying she assumed the parents had dinner planned, but the father replied \"not really\" and looked away. She then suggested takeout and ushered them out. After that, she told her son to maybe meet Chris elsewhere or at his house to avoid such situations again.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. From her perspective, she wasn't expecting four extra people and wasn't prepared to feed them. She's managing her household and the sudden influx might be a burden. On the other hand, the other family was in a situation where they might not have dinner otherwise, and she could have offered some help. But is she obligated to do so?\n\nI think it's a judgment call. She did her best to be polite but wasn't prepared. She's a mom, so her primary responsibility is her kids, and managing the household. She made it clear without being rude that she couldn't host more people. The father's response might have been a bit dismissive, but the mother's actions were to protect her own family's needs. Maybe she could have offered a small gesture, like a snack, but not a full meal. Since she's not financially responsible for them, it's not her fault. The answer is probably B.\n"
