Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The mom is a parent of three kids, which is a lot, and she's cooking a lot already. She's been feeding Chris, the son's friend, who isn't well off. But then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and she didn't plan on cooking for four more people. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout, but they stayed and she ended up feeling conflicted.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Hmm. On one hand, she didn't expect to host four extra people and she was honest about not having food for them. She also suggested they get takeout, which is a reasonable solution. On the other hand, they came to pick up Chris and maybe the family felt they had to take advantage of the situation because they're not well off. But the mom is doing her best to manage her household and resources. She also adjusted by limiting how much Chris comes over, which shows she's trying to find a balance. \n\nI think the key here is that she didn't make them stay, she offered a polite solution, and she's aware of her own situation. Maybe the family should have considered that she wasn't expecting them, but she also didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. However, she's managing her own family's needs, which is a priority. So probably she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
