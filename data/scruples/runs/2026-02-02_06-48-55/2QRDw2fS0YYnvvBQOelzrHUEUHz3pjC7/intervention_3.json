Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who hosts a friend's family unexpectedly and then decides to limit visits. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The mom has three kids, so cooking is already a big task. Chris comes over often, and this time his whole family shows up unannounced. She didn't cook for them, and when they mention being hungry, she responds by suggesting takeout and then cutting down the visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see both sides. On one hand, she's under no obligation to feed them. She's being polite, but she's not responsible for their dinner. On the other hand, maybe she could have been more empathetic. The family is poor, so maybe they can't afford takeout easily. But she's also managing her household and not expecting guests. \n\nThe mother's response was diplomatic, offering takeout and encouraging them to leave. Maybe she's within her rights. But could there be a better way to handle it without cutting off Chris's visits? Perhaps. However, she's also protecting her family's resources. \n\nI think the mother isn't in the wrong because she's not obligated to feed them. However, maybe she could have handled it more gracefully. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No).\n"
