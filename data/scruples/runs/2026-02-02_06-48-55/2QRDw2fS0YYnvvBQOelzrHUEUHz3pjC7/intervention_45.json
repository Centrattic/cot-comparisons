Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a mom of three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when Chris's family showed up unannounced with his parents and siblings, she declined to feed them, feeling she hadn't planned for four extra people. She told them to get takeout and then decided to limit Chris's visits.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is whether she's being unreasonable. On one hand, she's managing her household, which is already busy with three teenagers. She didn't have the extra food prepared. On the other hand, Chris's family is in a better-off position (since Chris isn't well-off, but his family's situation isn't clear). Wait, the original statement says Chris isn't too well off, but his parents showed up and said they weren't having a nice dinner. So maybe his family is in a tough spot financially.\n\nThe author's response was polite but firm. She didn't want to overextend herself. But the question is about being in the wrong. Did she have an obligation to feed them? Not necessarily. She wasn't responsible for their arrival. They came unannounced. She could have offered something if she had extra, but she didn't. \n\nSome might say she was selfish for not helping, especially if the family is struggling. Others might say she's managing her own household and can't be expected to feed everyone who walks in. \n\nThe author feels conflicted because she's being practical but also feels guilty. The key is whether she was obligated. Since it was a last-minute visit and she didn't have the resources, she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely by suggesting takeout. The decision to limit visits is her way of setting boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
