Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is a mom with three kids, and she's been cooking a lot because her son's friend, Chris, comes over often. Chris's family isn't well-off, and when they came to pick him up, there were four people at the door. The mom didn't cook for them, and when they mentioned being hungry, she told them to go get takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She's a parent juggling her own family's needs. Cooking for teenagers is a lot, and she might not have expected four extra people. Her response was polite but firm, directing them to takeout. She's trying to protect her family's resources.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family is in a tough financial situation. They might not have enough to eat, and asking for a meal when they're hungry is natural. The mom's reaction might come off as judgmental or uncaring, even if she's not intentionally being mean. The father's response that they \"weren't really\" having dinner could imply they need help, which the mom didn't offer.\n\nBut the key point is that the family just came to pick up Chris. The mom wasn't expecting them and didn't prepare for them. She handled it by suggesting takeout and closing the door. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries to protect her own family's meals and time. She's also adjusting the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid similar situations, which shows she's trying to balance her son's friendship with her own needs.\n\nI think the mom isn't in the wrong because she didn't have an obligation to feed them. She managed the situation politely and is now adjusting to prevent future issues. However, there's a nuance where empathy is important. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's managing her family's resources and setting boundaries, which is understandable.\n"
