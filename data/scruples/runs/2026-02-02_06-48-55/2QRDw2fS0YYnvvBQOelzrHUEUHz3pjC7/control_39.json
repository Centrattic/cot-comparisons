Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. The situation is that the author is a mom with teenagers who already cook a lot, and Chris, a friend of her son, comes over often. This time, Chris's family arrived unannounced, including his parents and two siblings. The family commented on the food smell and how nice the house is. The author didn't cook for them and instead suggested takeout and sent them away. Now she's feeling conflicted and considering limiting Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is already cooking for her own kids, who eat a lot. Chris comes over often, and now his whole family appears without notice. The parents didn't plan a dinner, so the author didn't expect to feed them. She politely declined, maybe to avoid being rude. But she feels guilty afterward.\n\nThe key points are: Was she obligated to feed them? Did she handle it politely? Is it reasonable to expect her to feed unexpected guests, especially when she wasn't prepared? The family didn't ask to be fed, but the parents said \"not really\" when asked about dinner plans. The author's response was to suggest takeout and send them away. She also adjusted her behavior afterward by limiting Chris's visits.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, it's generally not considered rude to not feed unexpected guests unless you're in a culture where hospitality is expected. The author was polite, tried to be diplomatic, and even offered a solution (takeout). She didn't make them feel unwelcome. The issue might be more about the family expecting a meal without being invited. The author has the right to manage her household and resources as she sees fit. The fact that she considered Chris's family's situation but still felt it was too much suggests she's trying to balance kindness with her own family's needs.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she handled the situation respectfully and had the right to decline feeding unexpected guests, especially given the context of her responsibilities to her family.\n"
