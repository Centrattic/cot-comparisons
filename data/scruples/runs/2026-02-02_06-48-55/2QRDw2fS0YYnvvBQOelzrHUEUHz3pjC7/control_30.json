Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not feeding the unexpected guests from Chris's family. \n\nFirst, the context: The mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and she's feeding him. Then, without prior notice, Chris's family arrives with two siblings. They comment on the food and hunger. The mom didn't prepare for four extra people, so she politely suggests they leave because she can't feed them. After that, she reduces Chris's visits. \n\nNow, considering the situation. The mother is under no obligation to feed them. She wasn't expecting them, and she's already managing her own family's meals. The family arrived unannounced, possibly expecting a meal. Her response was diplomatic, even suggesting takeout and urging them to leave. She also adjusted her son's interactions with Chris to avoid similar situations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation of hospitality? If she's feeding Chris, maybe the family thought they could come along. But the mom clearly states she didn't cook for four more. She handled it politely, so she's not rude. The father's comment about not having dinner planned might imply they were in a tough spot, but the mom can't be responsible for that. \n\nHer decision to limit Chris's visits seems reasonable to prevent future stress. She's protecting her family's well-being. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
