Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mom has her son's friend Chris coming over often, and Chris's family showed up unexpectedly with two siblings, leading to a situation where the mom didn't prepare for them. She declined to feed them, suggested they get takeout, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three kids, which is already a lot of work. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him when he comes over. But when Chris's family showed up without notice, she wasn't prepared. She tried to be polite but set a boundary by saying they should get takeout and leave because the kids were hungry. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't have a responsibility to feed them since they weren't invited and she wasn't expecting them. Her family's needs come first, especially with three teenagers. Declining to feed them because of the last-minute nature of the visit seems reasonable. However, she might have handled it more gracefully. Instead of being abrupt, maybe she could have offered a sandwich or some leftovers. But she did say \"take out it is\" which might have been a way to be polite while setting a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the family was in a difficult situation, being poor. But that doesn't mean others are obligated to feed them. It's about respect and how the situation was handled. She did mention the parents didn't have dinner planned, so they might not have expected to eat. The mother's reaction to the comment about hunger was to push them out the door, which might come off as cold. \n\nThe key points are: unexpected guests, not prepared, boundaries set, but perhaps not the most compassionate approach. She's also taking steps to limit future visits to avoid this. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she was obligated to feed them. Since they showed up unannounced and she wasn't responsible for their meal, she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could have been more considerate. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her family and set boundaries. However, some might argue she could have been more compassionate. But legally and morally, she's not obligated to feed them. So the answer is B.\n"
