Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom who's been feeding her son's friend Chris, who isn't well-off, when he comes over. She's okay with feeding Chris, but when Chris's parents and siblings showed up unannounced, she felt unprepared to feed four more people. She politely told them she hadn't planned for them and eventually sent them on their way. Now she's feeling conflicted about reducing Chris's visits or having her son go to his house instead.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she's a parent managing her household and meals, and it's reasonable to expect that guests should be planned for. She wasn't obligated to feed an unexpected four people. On the other hand, maybe the situation could have been handled differently to avoid making Chris or his family feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe mom did offer to order takeout but suggested they leave quickly, which might come off as abrupt. However, she had already made plans for her family and wasn't in a position to accommodate the extra guests. It's also important to note that the family was already at the door, so the mom didn't have prior notice. She tried to be polite and even offered an alternative (takeout), but realistically, she might not have the resources or time to handle that last-minute.\n\nChris's family might be in a tough situation, but the mom isn't responsible for feeding people who show up uninvited. Her right to manage her household and her resources is valid. She also took steps to adjust how often Chris visits, which is a reasonable way to prevent future issues without cutting off her son's friend entirely.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the mom's actions seem justified. She didn't overstep by turning away guests who were unexpected. The answer is B.\n"
