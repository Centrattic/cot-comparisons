Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. The author is a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot, and Chris comes over often. When Chris's family arrived unannounced with four people, the author didn't prepare extra food. She tried to politely suggest they leave, and now she's conflicted.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. She's managing a household with teenagers, which requires a lot of cooking. She didn't know Chris's family was coming, so she didn't plan for four more people. Her response was to suggest takeout and encourage them to leave, which might come off as abrupt. She's also adjusting Chris's visit frequency to avoid similar situations, which shows she's trying to manage her resources and family needs.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a difficult financial situation. The father mentioned they don't have a nice dinner planned, which could imply they're struggling. The author's refusal might be seen as not being hospitable, especially if they genuinely can't afford to eat. However, the author isn't obligated to feed them; she's not their responsibility. The key here is whether the author acted unkindly without considering alternatives.\n\nThe author's actions were direct but not necessarily cruel. She didn't invite them, and she's under no obligation to provide for them. However, maybe she could have offered a solution, like a simple meal or helping them find food. But given that she didn't plan for them, her immediate reaction was to send them to get takeout. She did express concern for the kids' hunger, which shows she wasn't being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She managed her household's needs and was honest about not being prepared. While there's room for more empathy in how she handled the situation, she isn't morally wrong for not feeding them unexpectedly. The answer is B.\n"
