Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a mom who regularly feeds Chris, a friend of her son. Chris isn't well-off, so it makes sense that his family might not have much. When Chris's family comes over, they comment on the food smell and express hunger. The author didn't plan for four extra people, so she politely suggests they take out because she hasn't cooked for them. The parents say they aren't really prepared, and the author pushes them to leave.\n\nThe author then reduces the frequency of Chris's visits. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has her own family to take care of. She's cooking for multiple teens, which is already a lot. She's not obligated to feed Chris's family when they show up unannounced. Her response, while perhaps firm, was diplomatic. She didn't offer food she wasn't prepared to give. It's reasonable for her to prioritize her own household's needs and not have last-minute guests.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family is poor, and the author is in a position to help. By not offering any food, even something small, she might be seen as closing the door on those in need. However, the author didn't know about the family's situation beforehand. The parents even said they weren't planning dinner, which might have been a test or an unexpected situation. The author might have felt cornered into providing food on the spot.\n\nBut was she in the wrong? The key here is intent and action. The author didn't do anything intentionally harmful. She tried to be polite but firm. The issue might be that she then decided to limit Chris's visits, which could hurt his feelings or make him feel unwelcome. However, the initial refusal to feed them wasn't malicious. She didn't have the capacity to feed four more people suddenly. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while it's commendable to help others, it's not a requirement. People can choose how they help, and the author is within her rights to set boundaries. Her actions, while perhaps harsh, were justified given the unexpected nature of the visit and her own family's needs. The guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations, but in terms of right or wrong, she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
