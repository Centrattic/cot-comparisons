Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up at her house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, so her plate is already full with cooking for her own family. Then Chris comes over regularly, and she feeds him without issue. Last week, Chris's family showed up unannounced. The family included two parents and two siblings, and they mentioned being hungry. The mother didn't prepare for them, so when they asked, she politely suggested they go get takeout. After that, she decided to limit Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did she have an obligation to feed them? Were they invited? Did she know in advance? The family arrived unexpectedly, not invited, and the mother wasn't prepared for four extra people. She tried to be polite but firm. She then adjusted her son's visits with Chris to avoid the stress.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, people often help others when they can, but there's no obligation to do so unless there's prior agreement. The mother made it clear she couldn't provide a meal, and instead suggested takeout, which is a reasonable solution. She didn't want to host them, which is understandable given the circumstances. Her actions were to protect her family's well-being and avoid last-minute stress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that offering food to a family in need is compassionate. However, the mother wasn't in a position to do so without notice. She had her own family's needs to consider. The father's response of \"not really\" when asked if dinner was planned might imply they were in a difficult situation, but the mother wasn't responsible for that. She handled it with diplomacy and took steps to prevent future issues.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the mother isn't in the wrong. She made a practical decision based on her circumstances. Answer B.\n"
