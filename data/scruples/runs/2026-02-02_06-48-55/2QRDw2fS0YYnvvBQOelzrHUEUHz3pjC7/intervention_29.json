Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that she's a mom of three kids and she's already cooking a lot for her teens. Chris, her son's friend, who isn't well off, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings, and the mom didn't prepare food for them. She tried to politely suggest that the family should go get takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted because she doesn't want her son to bring Chris over as much.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, the mom's perspective: She's already stretched thin with three kids, and cooking for four extra people wasn't planned. She tried to handle the situation politely, even suggesting takeout. She's setting boundaries to protect her family's resources. Maybe she's entitled to that. On the other hand, maybe she could have offered something else, like a snack or a quick meal, instead of sending them away. But she didn't have the food ready. \n\nChris's family might be in a tough spot. The father said \"not really\" when asked about dinner plans, which could indicate they're in a situation where they can't provide a meal. But the mom was clear she hadn't prepared for them. She's within her rights to not have to feed them. However, maybe the way she handled it was abrupt. She could have offered an alternative or asked if they needed help. But she said they were on the doorstep and the kids were hungry, so she had to act quickly. \n\nAlso, the mom's decision to reduce the visits is about managing her resources. She's the one managing the household, and it's her home. People shouldn't assume they can bring extra family without being asked. But maybe there's a lack of communication here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mom isn't obligated to feed the family, especially if it's unexpected. She tried to be polite. However, the father's comment about not having dinner might have been a signal that they needed help, but the mom had already made the decision. \n\nI think the key points are that the mom wasn't prepared, she handled it diplomatically (even if it felt harsh), and she's setting boundaries for her family. She's not in the wrong for not providing food without notice, but maybe could have found a middle ground. However, the situation was last-minute and unexpected. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
