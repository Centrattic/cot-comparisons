Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nShe has three kids, which is a lot, and she's already cooking for them. Chris, a son of a friend, comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family comes unexpectedly with four people, she wasn't prepared. She tried to politely send them away, mentioning they can get takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted about cutting back on visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong. The user thinks she's in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mom has a lot going on. She's managing a household with teenagers and a preteen, which is a big task. She didn't expect four more guests and wasn't prepared. It's reasonable that she didn't cook for them. She also tried to be polite in her response, suggesting takeout and gently ushering them out. She's prioritizing her family's needs, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the families could have communicated better. Chris's parents didn't inform her beforehand, so maybe they should have considered her situation. However, the mom was hosting Chris when his family showed up, so perhaps there's some responsibility on the other side. But she did mention that she's happy to feed Chris when he comes over, but four more guests without notice is a different scenario.\n\nThe mom's response was diplomatic. She didn't just kick them out but tried to be polite. She's also adjusting her son's visits to prevent future issues, which is a reasonable precaution. She's not refusing to help, but setting boundaries to manage her own family's needs.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, I think the mom is within her right to set boundaries. She's already stretched thin, and unexpected guests can be challenging. The other family's lack of planning doesn't obligate her to accommodate them without notice. So, the answer would likely be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's managing her household and making reasonable decisions for her family's well-being.\n"
