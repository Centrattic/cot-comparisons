Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom who's feeding her own kids and a friend of her son, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and the mom declines to feed them because she hadn't planned for them. The key points here are about hospitality, expectations, and whether the author overstepped.\n\nFirst, the author is a mom cooking for her own family and a regular guest, Chris. She didn't cook for four extra people who showed up unannounced. The family mentioned they weren't planning a dinner, and the mom suggested takeout and sent them on their way. She later reduced Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nI need to consider if she was obligated to feed them. Since Chris's family didn't ask ahead of time, maybe the author isn't responsible. On the other hand, maybe there's an unspoken expectation when someone's family shows up, especially in a home where they're already a guest. But the mom clearly isn't in a position to feed more people, and she tried to be polite by suggesting takeout. \n\nHer son's friend comes over often, so maybe the parents knew the frequency. But when the family came, it was unexpected. The mom's reaction seems reasonable because she hadn't planned for them. She's managing her own household and resources. The father's response (\"not really\") might imply they need food, but the mom had to set boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. Some might say yes because maybe she should have offered food regardless, but others might say no because she had no prior notice and it's her home. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. Since she's a parent with teenagers, the number of meals and costs add up. Her decision to limit visits to prevent future issues might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (she's not in the wrong) because she's managing her household's needs and didn't owe the family a meal without prior notice. However, there's a nuance where maybe she could have offered something simple if she had extra. But given the situation, her actions seem justified.\n"
