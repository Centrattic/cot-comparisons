Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. She's a mom with three kids, so cooking a lot already. Chris is a regular visitor, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his whole family shows up unannounced, including his parents and siblings, she didn't expect them. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout.\n\nFrom her perspective, she wasn't prepared for four extra people. It's her home, and she's managing her family's meals. She had to make a quick decision, and her response was diplomatic. She even offered takeout and told them to go since the kids were hungry. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a tough spot financially. They might not have had dinner plans, so her not offering food could be seen as not being generous. But the user's question is whether she's in the wrong. She didn't invite them, and they showed up unannounced. She's not obligated to feed them when she wasn't expecting them. \n\nI think the key points are that she was polite, tried to manage the situation, and set boundaries for the future. She's not at fault for not expecting four guests. So the answer is B.\n"
