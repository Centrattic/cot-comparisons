Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom hosts a friend of her son, Chris, but when Chris's family comes unexpectedly, she's not prepared to feed them all and sends them on their way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mom already takes care of feeding Chris when he comes over, but she didn't plan for his entire family to show up. She politely declined, explaining she didn't have food for them. The father mentioned they don't have much planned, but she suggested takeout and asked them to leave. Now she's feeling conflicted because she wants to limit Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's under no obligation to host or feed Chris's family. She made that clear when they arrived unexpectedly. She handled it politely, offering takeout as an alternative. However, some might argue that she should have been more accommodating, especially if she knew Chris was from a less well-off family. But others would say it's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when it's a last-minute, unexpected situation. \n\nThe mom is prioritizing her family's needs and her own preparedness. She's not being cruel; she's just being practical. The father's response (\"not really\") was a bit of a challenge, but the mom stood her ground without being rude. Her decision to limit visits is about managing her resources and time, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, could there be a better way to handle it? Maybe offering a snack or a drink while they wait? But given the context, she didn't have food prepared for them. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
