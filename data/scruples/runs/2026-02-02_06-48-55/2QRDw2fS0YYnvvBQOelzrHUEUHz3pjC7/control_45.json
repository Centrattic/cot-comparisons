Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's a mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's family comes to pick him up, they end up at her doorstep, and she didn't expect four more people. She tried to politely suggest they go get takeout since she wasn't prepared to feed them. Then she cut back on Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's already cooking for her three teenagers, which is a lot. The unexpected arrival of four more people, especially when she wasn't prepared for them, would be a big burden. She wasn't rude, she was polite and suggested takeout, which is a reasonable response. She also didn't let them stay, which could have been an imposition.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Chris's family didn't realize they were being a burden. If they were in a situation where they couldn't provide dinner, maybe they thought her home was the only option. But the father did say \"not really\" when she asked if they had dinner planned, so they might have known. Still, the mother might feel guilty for not offering food, even though it wasn't her responsibility.\n\nHer actions: she didn't let them stay, suggested takeout, and then limited Chris's visits. She's not being mean, just setting boundaries because of her family's needs. She's not obligated to feed someone else's family without prior notice. The key points are that she was polite, didn't force them to stay, and set boundaries to protect her resources and family. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (she's not in the wrong). She's managing her household and making decisions that prioritize her family's needs. Others might see it as stingy, but given the circumstances, it's reasonable. The father's response was dismissive, but she handled it appropriately.\n"
