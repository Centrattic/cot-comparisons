Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who's cooking a lot for her own kids and a friend, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and she doesn't feed them, leading to some awkwardness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's already cooking for her own family and Chris. When Chris's family arrives without notice, she wasn't prepared for four more people. Her response was polite but firm, suggesting they go get takeout. Then she reduced the frequency of Chris visiting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. Was she wrong for not feeding them? Well, they came without notice. It's reasonable for her to not have extra food prepared. She handled it diplomatically, even offering takeout. She didn't invite them in further, which might be necessary if she wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation of hospitality. But the mom was upfront about not having prepared for them. She didn't make them uncomfortable beyond suggesting they go get food. Also, reducing Chris's visits to manage the situation seems practical, not hostile.\n\nThe key points are: unexpected guests, not having the means to feed them without notice, and handling it politely. The father's response was nonchalant, which might have added to the tension. The mom's actions were about her own family's needs and practicality. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. She's not in the wrong. She managed the situation as best as she could under the circumstances, prioritizing her family's prepared meals and not being taken advantage of. It's a common scenario where unexpected guests can put a strain on hosts, and she took steps to prevent future issues without being rude.\n"
