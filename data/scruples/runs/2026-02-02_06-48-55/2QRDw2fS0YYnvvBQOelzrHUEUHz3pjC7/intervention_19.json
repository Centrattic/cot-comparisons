Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the mom) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. So first, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe mom has three kids, including teenagers who eat a lot. She's used to feeding one extra person (Chris) frequently. Last week, Chris's family showed up unannounced. She didn't expect four more people, so she wasn't prepared. She tried to politely decline by saying they might have dinner planned and suggested takeout. However, the father said \"not really\" and she ended up sending them away.\n\nNow, the key points here: the mom didn't cook for four extra people. She was feeding Chris regularly, but this time it was a bigger group. She felt it was last minute and wasn't responsible for feeding them. On the other hand, Chris's family might have expected to be fed since Chris was there often. The mom's response was polite but firm, and she later reduced Chris's visits to avoid similar situations.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't have the food prepared. She tried to handle it diplomatically. She's responsible for her family's meals and can't be expected to feed unexpected guests without notice. The dad's comment about not having dinner might have been a test or an attempt to get the food, but the mom isn't obligated to provide meals for people she didn't invite. She made a choice to protect her own household's needs and set boundaries. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe there's a cultural expectation or a sense of hospitality that could make her feel she should have offered something. But realistically, she was in her home, managing her own family's needs. She didn't act with malice; she just wasn't prepared and politely suggested an alternative. So, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
