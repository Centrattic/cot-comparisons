Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mom in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she's feeding her own kids a lot, and her son's friend Chris comes over often. When Chris's family arrives unexpectedly, the mom declines to feed them all, leading her to consider reducing their visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, which is already a lot of work. Chris is a friend who isn't well-off, and she's happy to feed him when he comes. But when his entire family shows up unannounced, it's a sudden increase from one to five people. She didn't prepare for that, and the family even mentions they aren't sure about their dinner plans. She responds by suggesting takeout and pushing them out, then later decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nHer actions are about managing her own household and resources. She's not obligated to feed people who aren't her responsibility. The family came to pick up Chris, not to have dinner. She tried to be polite but set a boundary. However, the father's response might indicate they genuinely need help, but the mom's responsibility is to her own family first. \n\nIs she wrong for not feeding them? Maybe not. People can't be expected to feed others they didn't plan for. But she might be wrong if the family was in a dire situation. The story doesn't say they were homeless or starving, just that they aren't well-off. She could have offered a snack instead of a full meal. But she might not want to commit to more than that. \n\nHer reducing Chris's visits to one per week seems fair, given the frequency was four. Maybe she's overstepping by not feeding them, but the alternative would be to adjust her own plans, which she might not be able to do. The key is whether she's unkind or inconsiderate. She tried to be diplomatic but firm. The family's reaction isn't mentioned, but the mom feels conflicted. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether she's morally wrong. Since she's a parent prioritizing her own family, I'd lean towards B (No). People can't be forced to feed unexpected guests, and she's managing her own resources. However, there's a nuance in how she handles it. She could have offered something small, but the main issue is uninvited guests. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
