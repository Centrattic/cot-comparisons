Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the mom (the author) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom has three kids, so she's cooking a lot already. Chris comes over often, which she's okay with, but when his whole family plus two siblings shows up unannounced, she didn't plan for four extra people. She tried to politely let them know she didn't have food for them and suggested takeout. Then she told her son to limit Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the main points here are about hospitality, unexpected guests, and the mom's responsibility. The mom is handling her own family's needs, and the sudden influx of guests wasn't planned. She didn't have the means to feed them, and the father didn't seem to have plans either. She's also adjusting her son's schedule to prevent this from happening again.\n\nOn one hand, the mom might be seen as being inconsiderate to Chris's family, especially if they're in a tough financial situation. It could be argued that she should have offered some food or help. But on the other hand, she's the one who has to cook for her own kids and wasn't expecting four more people. She tried to be polite and even suggested takeout, which is a practical solution. Also, she's setting boundaries to protect her own family's needs, which is reasonable.\n\nI think the key here is whether she had an obligation to feed them. Since Chris's family showed up unannounced and without prior arrangement, it's not necessarily her responsibility to feed them. Her response was to suggest takeout and then set boundaries in the future. She's not being hostile, just firm. So, I would lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
