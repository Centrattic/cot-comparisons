Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a mom who's feeding her own kids and a friend of one of them, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly, and the author doesn't want to feed them. She ends up sending them away and decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a single mom with three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over regularly, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his whole family shows up unannounced, she's not prepared. She tries to politely say they should leave, which they kind of do. Then she decides to reduce Chris's visits.\n\nNow, the key points here. Was she obligated to feed Chris's family? Probably not. She had no prior notice, and it's their home. The family didn't ask for permission to come in, which might be an issue. The author was upfront that she wasn't cooking for them. However, she might have felt some social pressure because they were poor. But she's not responsible for their situation. \n\nThe author's actions were to protect her resources and her family. She didn't want to be taken advantage of. On the other hand, maybe she could have offered a small gesture, like a snack, or let them stay for a bit without a full meal. But she was clear and polite, and they left. \n\nHer decision to limit Chris's visits seems self-protective, which is understandable. People might say she's being selfish, but others might agree she's setting boundaries. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she didn't have the obligation, then she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have been more accommodating. However, since it was a surprise and she wasn't expecting them, she's probably justified in her actions.\n"
