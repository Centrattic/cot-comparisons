Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom who's feeding her own kids a lot, and she's hosting a friend of her son, Chris. Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings and parents. They comment on the nice house and smell of food, and when the kid says they're hungry, the mom says they should have dinner plans, which they don't. She then tells them to get takeout and ushers them out. Now she's feeling guilty and reduced visits.\n\nThe question is if she's in the wrong. So first, consider the context. She's a parent managing her household, cooking for her own kids. Chris is a regular guest, but when his entire family shows up without notice, it's a lot more. She didn't plan for four extra people. Her response was polite but firm, setting a boundary. She even offered takeout as an alternative. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that the family came uninvited and expecting a meal. The mom didn't have to feed them, but perhaps there's social pressure. However, she's not obligated to host. She handled it diplomatically. On the other hand, the father didn't protest when she told them to get takeout. Maybe the mother's follow-up of limiting Chris's visits is harsh. She's using this as a reason to cut down visits, which might affect Chris's friendship with her son and potentially make him feel excluded. \n\nBut she's also protecting her resources and family. It's a valid concern. The answer depends on whether the mom's actions were reasonable in setting a boundary. Since she's not in the wrong for not feeding them, but maybe the way she handled it or the subsequent decision to limit visits could be seen as harsh. However, the initial action of refusing to feed them wasn't wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe others think she should have offered something small instead of shutting them out. However, she had already made that decision, and the family didn't seem upset. So I think B is the right choice here.\n"
