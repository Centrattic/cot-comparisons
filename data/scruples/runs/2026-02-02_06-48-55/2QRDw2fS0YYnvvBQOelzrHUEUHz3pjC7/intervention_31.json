Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom who didn't feed Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The mom regularly feeds Chris, but when Chris's family came over, she wasn't prepared for four extra people. She politely declined and suggested takeout. Then she reduced Chris's visits. \n\nThe key points here are her actions and the reasons behind them. She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. When the family arrived without notice, she hadn't planned for them. Her response was to send them to get takeout and limit future visits. \n\nFrom a perspective of empathy, maybe she's justified because she's managing her household. Unexpected guests can be a burden, especially when you're already stretched thin. But on the other hand, the family might have been in a tough spot financially, and the mom's reaction could be seen as dismissive or lacking compassion.\n\nBut wait, the mom did acknowledge the situation, saying she didn't cook for them and suggested takeout. She didn't turn them away entirely, just asked them to handle it themselves. Also, she's protecting her own family's resources. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a better way to handle it without cutting off Chris. The mom's solution is to reduce visits, which affects Chris's social life. Is that fair? Maybe there's a middle ground, like offering a snack instead of a full meal or discussing expectations beforehand.\n\nBut considering the sudden appearance of four people without notice, the mom wasn't at fault for not being prepared. She tried to be polite and offered a solution (takeout). So, her actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. The problem might be more about communication or setting boundaries earlier. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's managing her household and can't be expected to feed unplanned guests, especially when it's four people. Her response was direct but not malicious. The fault isn't entirely hers.\n"
