Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his entire family shows up unexpectedly, she didn't cook for them and sent them on their way, suggesting takeout. She's now feeling conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are unannounced guests and the mom's responsibility. She wasn't expecting four extra people, so she didn't prepare food for them. Her response was polite but firm. She made it clear she wasn't in a position to feed them, which is understandable given her family's needs and the last-minute nature of the visit.\n\nI think the mom isn't in the wrong because she had no prior notice. It's reasonable to expect that guests should communicate their needs in advance if they want to be fed. She was generous with Chris but couldn't extend that to four unexpected guests. Also, she's managing a household with teenagers, which already requires a lot of cooking. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a lack of empathy if the family is truly in need. But the mom handled it diplomatically, offering takeout and not being rude. She's also adjusting by limiting future visits, which shows she's trying to balance her resources.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
