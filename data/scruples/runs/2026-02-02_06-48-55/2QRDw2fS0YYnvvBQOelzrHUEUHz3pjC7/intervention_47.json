Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the situation is in the wrong. So, the setup is that she's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot because they eat a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But then Chris's family comes over unexpectedly, and she didn't cook for them. She tried to send them away, and now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is already cooking for her own three kids, which is a lot. She didn't expect four extra people. When the family arrived, they were hungry and maybe expecting food. The mom's response was diplomatic but firm, suggesting that maybe they should get takeout and closing the door. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's not obligated to feed the family. She's managing her household and resources. She can set boundaries, especially if it's unexpected. On the other hand, the family is poor, and maybe they were in a difficult situation. The mom's reaction might be seen as harsh because she didn't offer food despite their need. But maybe she's justified because she wasn't prepared, and it's unreasonable to expect her to feed them without notice.\n\nAlso, reducing the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid future situations makes sense as a practical decision. She's prioritizing her family's needs. However, the way she handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe there was a way to be kinder while still setting boundaries. For example, offering to help them find food somewhere else instead of just sending them away.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and boundaries. The mom didn't know they were coming, so she wasn't prepared. She's entitled to protect her resources and not have last-minute guests. But the family's comment about being hungry might have been a way to hint they needed help, which she didn't respond to. However, she can't be expected to feed everyone who comes through the door, especially if it's not arranged.\n\nIn terms of the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the answer is A (yes, wrong), then the reasoning would be that she could have been more compassionate. If B (no), then she's justified in protecting her family's resources and setting boundaries.\n\nI think the mom isn't in the wrong because she didn't have notice, and she's managing her household. It's reasonable to not feed unexpected guests. The family's situation is unfortunate, but that doesn't obligate her to feed them. So the answer would be B.\n"
