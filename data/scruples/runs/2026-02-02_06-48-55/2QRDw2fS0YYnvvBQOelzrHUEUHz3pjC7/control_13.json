Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mom has two teenagers and a preteen, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when his family shows up unexpectedly, she didn't prepare for them. She tried to be polite but ended up being firm, suggesting takeout and then reducing Chris's visits. Now she's feeling conflicted.\n\nHmm. The main question is about her actions. She didn't have the food ready, which is understandable. She's managing her household and resources. The family came uninvited, and she wasn't expecting four extra people. Her response was to say they should get takeout and then limit Chris's visits. \n\nI think the key points here are expectation management and hospitality. The mom isn't obligated to feed people she didn't invite. She tried to be polite but also set boundaries. The father's response was dismissive when she said they could take out. She's protecting her family's resources and time. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it more gracefully. But given that they showed up without notice, it's reasonable for her to not cook for them. She might feel guilty, but her actions were about her own family's needs. So, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
