Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. The situation involves her hosting Chris often, which already requires a lot of cooking for her own kids. When Chris's family arrives unannounced with four more people, she's not prepared and politely declines to feed them, suggesting takeout and hurrying them out.\n\nFirst, consider her perspective. She's a mom with three kids, already cooking a lot. Chris's frequent visits add to her workload. Now, four more guests show up without notice. She didn't cook for them, so she's not in a position to offer a meal. Her response seems practical. She's trying to protect her family's resources and manage her household. She even offers a polite alternative (takeout) and sets boundaries by reducing Chris's visits.\n\nFrom Chris's family side, they might feel embarrassed or that the mother is being stingy. But the father did say they weren't planning dinner, so maybe they expected her to feed them. However, it's not her responsibility to anticipate their needs. The mother isn't obligated to provide meals for unexpected guests, especially when it's a financial and time burden. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and expectations. The mother had no prior notice and wasn't expecting four additional people. She's already stretched thin. Setting limits is reasonable. She's not being mean; she's managing her household. The father's comment might have been a subtle request, but the mother isn't responsible for others' expectations. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. She's making practical decisions for her family's well-being. The situation isn't about wealth but about preparedness and respecting personal space. The mother's actions are justifiable.\n"
