Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding Chris' family when they unexpectedly showed up.\n\nFirst, the author is a mom who's already cooking for her kids. She mentions she's happy to feed Chris when he comes over, but this time Chris' family showed up with two siblings. She wasn't expecting four extra people. She tried to be polite, saying maybe their parents have dinner planned, but the father said they didn't. She then suggested takeout and ushered them out.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author wasn't in a position to feed four more people. She made a polite attempt to handle it, maybe a bit abrupt but not malicious. She also adjusted her son's plans afterward to avoid similar situations. \n\nOn one hand, maybe she could have offered something small or checked if they needed help, but she might not have the resources. On the other hand, she's managing her own household and has the right to set boundaries. The father's response was nonchalant, which adds context. \n\nThe key is intent. The author didn't set out to be rude; she's trying to manage her family's needs. The action of not feeding them isn't necessarily wrong when there's no prior agreement. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance in how she handled it. However, the main question is about being in the wrong, not about being polite. Since she's not obligated to feed unexpected guests, the answer is B.\n"
