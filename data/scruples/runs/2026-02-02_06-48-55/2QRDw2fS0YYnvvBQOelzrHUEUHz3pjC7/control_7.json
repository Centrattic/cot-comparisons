Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: She's a mom with three kids, so cooking is already a big part of her routine. Chris is a friend of her son, and he comes over often. Now, Chris's family, including parents and two siblings, showed up unexpectedly to pick him up. They mentioned needing the bathroom, commented on the food smell, and one sibling said they were hungry. The mom didn't cook for four extra people, so she politely tried to send them on their way. After that, she reduced Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she did something wrong. From her perspective, she wasn't expecting four more people, and she's managing her household's needs. She tried to be polite by suggesting takeout and moving along. But she's feeling guilty and wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In some cultures, hospitality is expected to the point of feeding everyone, but in others, it's more about what's reasonable. She wasn't obligated to feed them, especially if they showed up unannounced and she didn't plan for them. However, the father did mention they weren't having dinner, which might imply they need help. But she didn't have the capacity, and she handled it by suggesting takeout and moving them out.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't refuse to feed them outright; she just redirected. She also adjusted her son's visits to avoid similar situations. She's balancing her family's needs and resources. On the other hand, maybe there's a lack of empathy towards Chris's family's situation. But she's not responsible for their circumstances. The father didn't ask for help; he just mentioned they weren't having dinner, which the mom might interpret as a request, but it's not clear. She's within her rights to manage her household and not overextend herself. So, probably answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
