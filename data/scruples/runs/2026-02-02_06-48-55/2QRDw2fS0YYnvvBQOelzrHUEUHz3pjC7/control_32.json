Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mom is in the wrong here. So, she's a mom of three kids, which already is a lot. She's cooking a lot because teenagers eat a lot. Then Chris, her son's friend, comes over often. But Chris isn't well-off, so maybe his family isn't in a great financial situation.\n\nThe situation is that Chris's family showed up unannounced to pick him up. The family includes the parents and two siblings. When they came in, they commented on the nice house and the food smell. One of the kids said they were hungry. The mom, who didn't cook for extra people, responded by saying she thought the parents had dinner planned. When the dad said \"not really\" and looked away, she told them to get takeout and to leave because the kids were hungry. After that, she told her son to maybe hang out elsewhere or even go to Chris's house to avoid this happening again.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's being practical. She's already cooking for her own kids, and having four extra people unannounced would be a burden. She didn't cook for them, and maybe she's not in a position to feed them. On the other hand, Chris's family is poor, and maybe they didn't have dinner plans. The mom's response was a bit abrupt, pushing them out the door. She's trying to protect her resources for her own family, which is understandable. But maybe she could have handled it more gracefully, like offering to share a meal or a small snack instead of sending them away. But she didn't have food ready for them, so maybe she couldn't do that. \n\nHer son's friend's family showing up uninvited might be part of the issue too. Maybe the parents should have checked if the host was okay with having them over. The mom's reaction of reducing the visits to one per week or suggesting going to Chris's house is her way of setting boundaries. It's her home, and she's entitled to set those boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's managing her household and her resources, and while the situation might have been handled more kindly, she's not at fault for wanting to protect her family's needs. The main issue here is about boundaries and unannounced guests, not necessarily her being wrong.\n"
