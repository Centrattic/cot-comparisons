Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom did the wrong thing by not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom has three kids, so she's busy cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son's, and he comes over often. The mom's okay with feeding Chris. But then Chris's whole family shows up unexpectedly. They mention the nice smell of food and one sibling says they're hungry. The mom tries to politely say that she didn't cook for them, suggesting they go get takeout. The dad responds with \"not really\" and looks away, so she tells them to go get takeout and hurry up. Then she limits how often Chris comes over.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe key points here are: She didn't expect four more people. She's already cooking for her own family. She tried to be polite but didn't make food for them. She's setting boundaries to avoid future issues. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her resources (food) and her time. She's a parent with her own family's needs. She didn't want to be caught off guard again, so she's reducing the frequency of Chris's visits. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have thought they could eat there since they were coming to pick up Chris. The mom's refusal might be seen as not generous, especially if they're struggling financially. However, the mom isn't obligated to feed them, especially if they showed up uninvited. \n\nThe mom's response was diplomatic, suggesting takeout instead of just turning them away. She's also adjusting future interactions to avoid the same situation. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the mom is within her rights to set boundaries. She's not responsible for feeding unexpected guests. Her actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. However, some might argue that she could have offered something simple if she had extra. But since she didn't cook for them, and she's managing her household, her response is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
