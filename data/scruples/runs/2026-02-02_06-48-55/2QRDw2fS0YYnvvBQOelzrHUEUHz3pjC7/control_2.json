Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom who feeds her kids and sometimes feeds a friend, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up unannounced, and the mom didn't prepare food for them, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is responsible for her own family's meals and might not have the resources or time to feed additional guests without prior notice. She had no idea that Chris's family was coming over. They showed up unannounced and even mentioned they weren't expecting food, just commenting on the smell. \n\nThe mom's response was diplomatic, suggesting they have dinner elsewhere. She didn't want to create a situation where she had to feed four extra people on short notice. Her decision to limit Chris's visits is understandable to avoid similar situations. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of prior notice, the family not being invited, and the mom's responsibility to her own household. The family didn't ask for food, just made comments. The mom's actions seem reasonable because she can't be expected to provide for unexpected guests. \n\nHowever, the mom might feel guilty, but the question is whether she was wrong. The answer would hinge on whether the family had a right to expect food without being invited. Since they showed up uninvited, the mom isn't obligated to feed them. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But need to check if there's any cultural or social expectations that might make it different. In many cultures, guests are welcomed, but if they didn't ask, then it's not the host's responsibility. So B makes sense.\n"
