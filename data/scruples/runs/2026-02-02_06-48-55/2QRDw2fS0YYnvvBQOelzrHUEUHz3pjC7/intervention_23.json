Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a mom who feeds her own kids and a friend of her son, Chris. Then Chris's family shows up uninvited, and the author didn't cook for them. She tried to politely send them away, and now she's conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had no prior notice of the family coming over. She was cooking for her own family and Chris, not expecting four extra people. When the family arrived, they mentioned being hungry, but the author didn't have food prepared for them. The father said they didn't have plans, so the author suggested takeout and sent them on their way. She then decided to limit Chris's visits.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author isn't obligated to feed people who show up uninvited. She's managing her household and resources, which is understandable. On the other hand, maybe there's a lack of empathy towards someone who might be in a tough financial situation. But the author didn't refuse help outright; she just wasn't prepared. The family came in unannounced, and the author politely but firmly sent them away without making them feel bad. She even suggested takeout, which is a practical solution they could do themselves.\n\nThe author's decision to reduce Chris's visits is about managing her own time and resources. She's not cutting off Chris completely, just adjusting the frequency. It's a reasonable boundary to set, especially if the uninvited family visits are causing stress. The key here is that the author didn't offer food but also didn't make the family feel unwelcome. They were just not prepared. So, was she in the wrong? I think no. She didn't have an obligation to feed them on short notice, and setting boundaries is reasonable. The father's reaction might have been a test, but the author handled it without being rude.\n"
