Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong. The situation is about a mom who has a friend of her son, Chris, coming over a lot. When Chris's family comes to pick him up, they end up being on her doorstep, and she didn't cook for them. She felt uncomfortable because they mentioned being hungry and she didn't want to feed four extra people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has two teenagers and a preteen, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris's family isn't well off, but she's feeding Chris when he comes over. The unexpected part is when Chris's family shows up, which wasn't planned. She tried to politely suggest they leave, and then later decided to limit how much Chris comes over.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't owe them a meal because they hadn't been invited. She made a polite comment about their dinner plans, and when the father said they weren't having much, she suggested takeout and asked them to leave. That seems reasonable because she wasn't expecting four more people. She's under no obligation to feed them. However, maybe she could have offered to share a meal or offered them something quickly. But considering she wasn't prepared, maybe she handled it the best she could. The guilt she feels might be because she's empathetic, but from a rights perspective, she's not wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
