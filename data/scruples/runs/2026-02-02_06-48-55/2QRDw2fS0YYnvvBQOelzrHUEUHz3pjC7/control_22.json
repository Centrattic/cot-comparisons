Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mom feeds her own kids and sometimes feeds Chris, the son of a friend. Then, when Chris's entire family shows up unexpectedly, she didn't prepare for them and ended up being polite but firm in not feeding them. She's now feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the mom. She's a parent with three kids, which means she's already managing a lot of meals. It's reasonable for her to not expect or prepare for extra four people without prior notice. She did offer to order takeout, which is a gesture of kindness, even though she was pushing them to leave. The way she handled it seems diplomatic, as she acknowledged their comments but didn't have the food ready.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have felt embarrassed or hungry. The father's response was non-committal, which could imply they don't have the means for dinner. But the mom wasn't aware of their situation beforehand. She didn't turn them away rudely; instead, she tried to be polite while managing her own household's needs.\n\nThe key points here are her responsibility to her own family versus the unexpected guests. She's not obligated to feed people who pop in without notice. The fact that she had already adjusted her frequency of hosting Chris is a proactive step to prevent future issues. Her feelings of being an asshole might stem from guilt, but she's prioritizing her family's needs, which is valid.\n\nI think the main issue is whether her actions were wrong. Since she was honest and polite, and didn't have prior knowledge, she's in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
