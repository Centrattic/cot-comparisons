Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the mom) is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, the mom has three kids, so she's already cooking a lot. Chris is a friend of her son, and she's been feeding him when he comes over. Now, Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with his parents and siblings. They were just there to pick him up, but the parents didn't mention they were coming. The mom wasn't prepared for four extra people.\n\nShe tried to be polite, saying they probably have dinner planned. The dad says they don't, so she insists they should get takeout and ushers them out. Then she reduces the visits from four to one a week, maybe even suggests her son go to Chris's house instead.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't expect extra guests and wasn't prepared. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if it's affecting her family. She's not obligated to feed everyone who comes through her door. On the other hand, the family might be in a tough situation financially, and the mom's reaction could be seen as harsh. But she was trying to be diplomatic and offered takeout as an alternative.\n\nThe key points are that the guests showed up unannounced, and the mom wasn't responsible for their unexpected presence. She handled it politely and even gave an option. The decision to limit visits afterward is about setting boundaries, which is her right. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
