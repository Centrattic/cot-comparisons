Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mom didn't feed Chris's family even though they came over unexpectedly. She had already cooked for her own family and wasn't prepared for four extra people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom of three kids, cooking a lot. Chris comes over often, and his family isn't well off. When Chris's family showed up, they wanted to stay, but she wasn't prepared. She politely said she hadn't cooked for them and suggested takeout. Then she limited Chris's visits.\n\nThe question is whether she did the right thing. On one hand, she's managing her household and resources. She's not obligated to feed others beyond her family. Maybe she felt it was a last-minute thing and couldn't adjust. On the other hand, the family was in need, and the parents didn't have a dinner planned. But the parents brought them there expecting something, maybe? Or maybe they knew she was feeding them before. \n\nThe mom's response was diplomatic but firm. She didn't offer food, but she also didn't make them stay. She suggested takeout, which is a compromise. Then she reduced the frequency of Chris's visits to avoid similar situations. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not required to feed others. Her family's comfort and her own preparedness matter. She handled it politely and even gave an alternative. Maybe the parents expected her to feed them, but that's on them. The mom made a reasonable decision for her family. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
