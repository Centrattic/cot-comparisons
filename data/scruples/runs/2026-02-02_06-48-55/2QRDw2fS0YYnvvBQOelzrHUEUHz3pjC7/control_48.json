Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the mom in the story is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unannounced.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mom has three kids, including teenagers and a preteen, and she's already cooking a lot. Chris, her son's friend, is from a less well-off family and often comes over, which she's okay with. But when Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with four people, including his parents and siblings, she didn't plan to cook for them. She tried to politely say they should go get takeout or leave since she wasn't expecting them. Then she reduced the number of visits.\n\nNow, considering her perspective: She's managing a household with three kids, so cooking is already a big task. Unexpected guests might not be feasible. She's being honest that she didn't prepare for them. Her response was diplomatic, suggesting they get takeout and urging them to leave because the kids are hungry. She's also setting boundaries to prevent future incidents, which might be necessary for her household's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have thought that since they came to pick up Chris, maybe there was an unspoken understanding that they could stay for dinner. The father's response of \"not really\" when asked about dinner could imply they were in a tough spot, but the mom isn't obligated to provide for them. However, maybe there's a cultural expectation or a sense of hospitality that the mom's actions could be seen as cold.\n\nBut the key points here are that she didn't have the food ready, she didn't know they were coming, and she's a single parent managing a lot. Her actions were to maintain her household's routine and not overextend herself. She's not refusing to help in a broader sense, just not accommodating last-minute, unexpected guests.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If someone shows up unannounced and expects you to feed them without prior notice, it's reasonable to say you can't. The mom handled it politely and even suggested alternatives. She's also setting boundaries to avoid future situations, which is fair. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
