Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a mom with three kids, so she's already dealing with a lot of cooking and feeding. Then Chris, her son's friend, comes over often, and she's okay with feeding him. But when Chris's entire family suddenly shows up, expecting to eat, she's not prepared. She politely declines, and then decides to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to see if she's in the wrong. She was already planning for her own family and Chris. The sudden arrival of four more people would definitely be a problem. She tried to be polite by suggesting they get takeout. The father didn't seem to care and just looked away. \n\nShe's not obligated to feed people she didn't know were coming. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially when it's causing stress. Her decision to cut back on Chris's visits isn't malicious; it's about managing her resources and time. People can't expect others to cater to them without notice. The family's comment about being hungry was probably a stretch, and she handled it as best as she could. So, she's not wrong for protecting her own family's needs.\n"
