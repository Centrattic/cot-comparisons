Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's feeding her own kids a lot, but when Chris's family unexpectedly shows up, she doesn't want to feed them because she didn't prepare for four more people. She tried to politely say that maybe they should take out, but the father said \"not really\" and she then suggested they leave quickly. Now she's feeling guilty and wants to know if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mother with three kids, so cooking a lot is part of her routine. Chris is a friend of her son who isn't well off, so she's been feeding him when he comes over. But when the entire family comes to pick up Chris, it's a last-minute thing. She didn't plan for four extra guests. Her response was diplomatic, implying they should take out instead. Then she cut down the number of visits. \n\nIs it wrong to not feed them? Well, the family came unannounced with four people. She already had her own family to feed, and they didn't ask in advance. It's understandable that she wouldn't have prepared for that many extra people. Her comment about the parents not having a dinner planned was a bit awkward, but she's trying to be polite. The father's response was nonchalant, but she still offered takeout as an alternative. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. Chris's family arrived without prior notice, so she wasn't responsible for their dinner. She's under no obligation to feed them on short notice, especially when it's four people. The fact that she's feeding Chris when he comes over is one thing, but the whole family coming over is different. She's protecting her own family's needs, which is important. \n\nHowever, she might be seen as insensitive if she's known for being generous. But since they came uninvited and without notice, it's a bit of a social dilemma. Maybe the father expected her to offer food, but she didn't have the means. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting down on Chris's visits because of this might be seen as overreacting. But she's trying to avoid future situations where the family shows up again. \n\nOverall, I think she's not in the wrong. She handled it politely, and it's reasonable to expect guests to plan ahead. The father's family should have communicated if they needed to come over. So the answer is B.\n"
