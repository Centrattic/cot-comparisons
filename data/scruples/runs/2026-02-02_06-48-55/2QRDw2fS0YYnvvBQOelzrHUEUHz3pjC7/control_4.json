Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they unexpectedly showed up. So, the situation is that Chris comes over often, and his family came to pick him up, bringing two siblings and parents. The mom hadn't planned for them and didn't offer food. The father said they weren't sure about dinner, and the mom suggested takeout and sent them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom is responsible for feeding her own teenagers, so she's already managing a lot. She didn't have extra food prepared for four more people. When the family came, they were there to pick up Chris, so maybe they weren't supposed to be guests. The mom tried to be polite but had to manage her own household.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have been in a tough spot. The father said they weren't sure about dinner, which could imply they might not have much. But the mom wasn't in a position to help. The key here is whether she was obligated to feed them. Since they arrived unannounced and she had no prior knowledge, it's reasonable she couldn't accommodate them. She even suggested takeout, which is a kind alternative. \n\nThe mom's response seems appropriate given the circumstances. She's balancing her own family's needs. People in need might expect help, but without prior arrangement, it's not necessarily her responsibility. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She handled it as best as she could without overstepping.\n"
