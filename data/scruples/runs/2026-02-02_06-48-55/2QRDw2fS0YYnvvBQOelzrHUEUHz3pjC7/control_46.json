Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the mom is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's feeding her own kids and Chris, the friend. Then Chris's family comes over unexpectedly with his parents and siblings, and they end up commenting on the food. She didn't plan to feed them, so she tries to send them on their way. Now, she's feeling guilty but also wants to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, which is a lot to manage. Chris comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But when Chris's family shows up unannounced, she wasn't prepared. The family members comment on being hungry and the nice smell of food. She responds politely but lets them know she didn't cook for them and suggests takeout. Then she tells her son to maybe meet Chris elsewhere to avoid future issues.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's already stretched thin with her own family's meals. She didn't invite Chris's family, and they appeared without notice. She didn't have the resources (food, time, etc.) to accommodate them. Her actions seem practical\u2014she's protecting her own household's needs. The father's response about not having dinner planned might imply that they expected to eat there, but that's not necessarily her responsibility. She did what she could to handle the situation without being rude, like offering takeout and politely ushering them out.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation or social norm where if someone visits, you offer food. However, the mom didn't invite them, and they came as a group. She's not obligated to feed people who weren't invited. The family might have assumed they could help themselves, but that's not reasonable without prior arrangement. The mom's reaction seems appropriate given the circumstances. She's maintaining her household's boundaries while being courteous.\n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
