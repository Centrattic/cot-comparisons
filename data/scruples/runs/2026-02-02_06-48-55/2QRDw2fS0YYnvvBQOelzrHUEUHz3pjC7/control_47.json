Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. So, the situation is that the mom is cooking for her own family, including her teenagers, and Chris, who's a friend of her son, comes over often. Then Chris's family shows up to pick him up, and they comment on the food. The mom didn't prepare for them, so she told them to get takeout. Now she's feeling conflicted about limiting Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has three kids, which is a lot. Cooking for them already takes a lot of time and resources. When Chris's family shows up unannounced with four people, that's a sudden increase in workload. She wasn't planning to feed them, so her response was to tell them to get takeout. That's practical because she can't just add four more meals last minute. \n\nThe family said they weren't planning dinner, so maybe they expected the host to provide. But the mom isn't their family, so expecting her to feed them might be unreasonable. She was polite but firm. She even offered takeout as an alternative, which is probably the best she could do in the moment. \n\nThen she reduced Chris's visits from four to one per week. That's a reasonable way to manage the situation without being hostile. She's trying to balance her family's needs with her generosity. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family didn't mean to impose, but the mom felt it was an imposition. It's a delicate balance. The mom isn't being mean; she's setting boundaries. The fact that the father said \"not really\" when asked about dinner might indicate they knew they were being a bit forward, but the mom handled it gracefully. \n\nI think the key here is that the mom is not obligated to feed people she didn't invite. She was kind in her response and tried to help by suggesting takeout. She's also adjusting her son's social life to prevent future issues, which shows she's proactive. So, she's in the right. Answer B.\n"
