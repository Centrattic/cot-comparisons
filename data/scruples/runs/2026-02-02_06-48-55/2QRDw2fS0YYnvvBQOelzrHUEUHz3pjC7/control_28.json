Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not feeding the additional four people from Chris's family. The situation is that the author's son has a friend Chris who comes over often, and Chris's family showed up unexpectedly with his siblings and parents. The author didn't cook for them, tried to politely suggest they leave, and then reduced the number of visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has three kids, so cooking already takes up a lot of time. Chris's family isn't well off, and the author is being kind by feeding Chris when he's over. But when the family showed up unannounced, she wasn't prepared for four more people. She tried to handle it diplomatically by saying they probably have dinner planned, then suggesting takeout and ushering them out. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she was already cooking for her own family and wasn't expecting guests. She didn't make a big deal about it, tried to be polite, but her family's needs come first. It's not her responsibility to feed people she didn't know were coming. Also, she's making a decision to limit visits to avoid this situation again. That's her right to manage her household. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural expectation that when people come to your home, you provide food. But in this case, they were there to pick up Chris, not to visit. The author didn't invite them, and they arrived unexpectedly. She handled it as best as she could without making a scene. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. She acted in her family's best interest and handled the situation respectfully.\n"
