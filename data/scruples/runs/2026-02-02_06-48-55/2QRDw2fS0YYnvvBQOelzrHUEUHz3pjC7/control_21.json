Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the mom in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nShe's a mom with three kids, two teenagers and a preteen. She's used to cooking a lot. Her son's friend Chris comes over often, and she's happy to feed him. But then Chris's family shows up unexpectedly with two siblings. She didn't plan to feed four extra people. When they comment on the food smell, she says she's sure they have dinner planned. The dad says \"not really,\" and she suggests takeout and ushers them out. Now she's cutting down on Chris's visits or suggesting he meet elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I should consider her perspective. She's managing her household and meals, which is a lot. She didn't expect four extra people, so not preparing for them makes sense. She might feel stressed about the sudden guests and not having enough food. She's a parent, so her main responsibility is her own family's well-being. She's also trying to avoid future situations by reducing Chris's visits.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might be in a tough financial situation. The dad said they don't have dinner planned, implying they might not have enough. In that case, maybe the mom could have offered to share a meal, even if it's not planned. But she did offer a polite refusal, saying takeout is better and they should go. Maybe she could have been more compassionate, but she's also not in a position to feed more people without prior notice.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, she had no obligation to feed them. She was polite, even if firm. She's managing her resources. However, the way she handled it might come off as dismissive. But considering her situation, she's trying to protect her own family's needs. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she could have offered something, even if it's leftovers or a small meal. But she might not have any extra food prepared. It's a tricky balance between kindness and practicality.\n\nI think the key points are: she didn't plan for four extra people, she politely declined, and she's adjusting to prevent future issues. The dad's response was nonchalant about their dinner plans, so maybe expecting her to provide when they didn't plan either. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
