Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who had Chris's family show up unexpectedly, and she didn't prepare food for them. She felt it was too much and now wants to limit Chris's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's perspective. She's a single parent with three kids, so managing meals for her own family is already a lot. She didn't cook for the extra four people, which makes sense because it's a last-minute request. She tried to politely decline by suggesting takeout and moving them along. Her actions seem to protect her family's resources and time.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family is mentioned as not well-off. They might have been in a situation where a free meal could have been helpful. The mom's comment about takeout doesn't solve their problem if they can't afford it. Also, the dad's \"not really\" response might indicate they don't have food planned, which could be a real issue. But the mom might not know that for sure.\n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. The mom didn't cook for the extra people because it wasn't planned. She tried to handle it politely. It's understandable that she felt overwhelmed. However, maybe there could have been a more empathetic approach, like offering a snack or a simple meal instead of takeout, but that's hindsight.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to balance both sides. The mom isn't obligated to feed others, especially with no prior notice. She's making a reasonable choice to prioritize her family's needs. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
