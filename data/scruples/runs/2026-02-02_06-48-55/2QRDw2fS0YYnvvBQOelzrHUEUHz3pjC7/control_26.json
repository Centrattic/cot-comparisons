Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom in the situation is in the wrong. She's a mom of three kids and she usually feeds Chris, the son's friend. Then Chris's entire family shows up unexpectedly, and she didn't cook for them. She politely turned them away and now feels conflicted because she told her son to limit Chris's visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, she's in a position where she's hosting a friend, expecting to feed one more person. The friend's family shows up without notice, adding four people. She didn't prepare for them. Her response was to politely decline, suggesting they get takeout and leave because the kids are hungry. Then she reduces the frequency of visits.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She's cooking for her own kids and one friend. Four extra people isn't feasible. She's being honest about her situation. She's not forcing them to stay, just redirecting them. The father's response that they \"not really\" have dinner planned might imply they expect her to feed them, but she's not obligated. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family had an expectation that if they came to pick up Chris, they could stay for dinner. But she didn't know they were coming. She was clear that she hadn't prepared for more people. Her response was diplomatic, and she's setting boundaries to protect her family's needs. \n\nI think the key points are: she didn't know about the family's arrival, she was honest about her limitations, she offered an alternative (takeout), and she's setting boundaries to prevent future issues. She's not being rude, just firm. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
