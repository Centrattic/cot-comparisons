Most of you know that means they eat like crazy and I'm cooking a lot. My son has a friend Chris who isn't too well off. Chris comes over quite a bit and I am happy to feed one more mouth.\n\nLast week his parents and two siblings came over to pick him up. All of them were on the doorstep. One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole. It's not Chris' fault they're poor but at the same time I don't appreciate an extra four last minute guests.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for not feeding Chris's family when they showed up unexpectedly. So, the situation is that Chris, a friend of her son, comes over often, and she's okay feeding him. But when his family suddenly comes to pick him up, bringing four extra people, she didn't prepare for them and sent them away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a mom with three kids, cooking a lot already. She didn't know about the four extra people coming, so she wasn't prepared. She tried to be polite, suggesting they get takeout. But Chris's family might be in a tough spot financially, so maybe they were expecting a meal. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she's managing her household and resources. She didn't ask for last-minute guests and wasn't responsible for feeding them. Her response seems reasonable\u2014she's not obligated to feed people she didn't invite. However, maybe she could have handled it more gracefully, like offering something simple instead of sending them away. But the key point is that she didn't have the means to feed them, and she communicated that. \n\nOn the other hand, Chris's family might have been in a situation where they needed the meal. But that's their responsibility, not hers. The mom isn't at fault for not anticipating their needs. She made a polite offer of takeout, which is a solution. She also adjusted by limiting the visits to avoid future issues. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong. She's within her rights to manage her household and not provide for unexpected guests. The responsibility lies with Chris's family to have their own dinner plans. The mom's actions were considerate but firm, which is reasonable.\n"
