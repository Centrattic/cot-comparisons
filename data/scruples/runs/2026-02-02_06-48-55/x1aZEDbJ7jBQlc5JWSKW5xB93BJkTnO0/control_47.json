I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant lectured them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe the airline allows economy class passengers to use first class bathrooms when necessary? If that's the case, then the flight attendant's reaction might be unwarranted.\n\nThen there's the situation on the flight. The flight attendant was being strict with other passengers about rules, which might mean she's having a bad day or is particularly strict. The author was in an awkward position needing to use the bathroom when there was a long line. The first class bathroom was empty, so using it makes sense to avoid waiting. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author break a rule? If the airline doesn't prohibit economy passengers from using first class bathrooms, then the author isn't at fault. The flight attendant's anger might be over a minor rule, and the author's response of walking away could be justified if they felt the lecture was unnecessary. \n\nAlso, the flight attendant followed them and made a loud comment about rudeness. The author's action of walking away might have been a reasonable way to end the interaction, especially after the initial acknowledgment. \n\nHowever, interrupting the flight attendant and walking away could be seen as disrespectful. But the author's reasoning is that the lecture felt like a bombardment after a long day. \n\nIn terms of workplace rules, flight attendants might have protocols to enforce, but if the policy isn't clear or consistently applied, the author's action might be understandable. The main question is whether the author violated a specific rule. If not, then they're not in the wrong. If there's a rule against it, then maybe they are. But since the user mentions it's not uncommon for the airline to have friendly service, maybe the rules aren't strict on bathroom usage. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they followed the flight attendant's initial announcement (using the bathroom before landing) and used an available facility when there was a line. The flight attendant's reaction seems harsh in this context. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
