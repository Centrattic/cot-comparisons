I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in the row behind it and then walking away when a flight attendant lectures them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. The author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without being reprimanded. However, maybe there are specific regulations about which passengers can use first class amenities. Even if they've done it before, if it's against the rules this time, that's a problem. But the user says the author didn't do it on purpose to make things harder for the FA, which complicates things.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's reaction. The FA was already acting strangely, being strict with other passengers. When the author used the bathroom, the FA waited and then lectured them. The author then walked away, which led the FA to follow and call them rude. The key here is whether the author's action of walking away was disrespectful. The FA was doing her job, even if her tone was harsh. Walking away might be seen as dismissive or rude, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author argues that the lecture was unnecessary, but the FA's job is to enforce rules. Even if the rules aren't clear, the author's response of ignoring the FA could be seen as uncooperative. Also, the FA followed them and spoke loudly, which might be unprofessional, but the author's choice to walk away might have escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a long day and was stressed. The FA's behavior was already off-putting, so the author might have felt justified in cutting the interaction short. However, in a professional setting, even if someone is unkind, it's usually better to respond politely. Walking away could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a public space where others can hear the argument.\n\nSo, weighing the FA's enforcement of rules against the author's stress and past behavior, the author might be in the wrong for not engaging respectfully. Even if the FA was being overly harsh, walking away and ignoring her could be considered rude. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
