I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a flight attendant was upset because the person used the first class bathroom when they were sitting in economy. The author says they've done this before without issues, but this time the FA got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines probably have specific guidelines about which bathrooms passengers can use based on their class. If the flight attendant is enforcing those rules, then using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger might be against the rules. The author mentions they're a premier member but still in economy, so maybe they have some privileges, but does that include accessing first class bathrooms?\n\nThe author was in the row behind first class, so maybe the bathroom is accessible to them, but maybe not. The key point is whether there's a policy allowing economy passengers to use first class bathrooms. If there isn't, then the author might be violating a rule. However, the author says they've done this before without being reprimanded, which complicates things. Maybe different attendants have different enforcement styles.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The flight attendant followed the author and made a loud comment about being rude. The author says they were tired and didn't want to listen to a lecture. Interrupting the FA with \"thank you for telling me\" and walking away could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. The FA's job is to enforce rules and ensure safety, so the author's reaction might be unprofessional.\n\nBut the FA's behavior might be at fault too. If she was already being strict with other passengers, perhaps her reaction was overly harsh. However, the author's choice to walk away after being addressed could still be seen as disrespectful. In customer service scenarios, it's usually better to listen out of courtesy even if you disagree.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author followed the airline's rules. If using the first class bathroom is restricted, then they're in the wrong. But if it's allowed, then the FA's reaction is the problem. Since the author isn't sure about the policy and mentions others might have different experiences, it's possible they were violating a rule. Their response to the FA's lecture was disrespectful, so even if the FA was overstepping, walking away and ignoring her isn't the right move. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they broke a rule and responded inconsiderately. However, there's nuance if the rules aren't clear. But given the information, the author did something against company policy and reacted poorly.\n"
