I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in the row behind it, and then walking away when a flight attendant lectures them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The user mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe there's no strict rule against it. But maybe there are rules now? The flight attendant's reaction suggests there's a policy they're following.\n\nBut wait, the user has premier status and often chooses seats. Maybe they're in a seat that's allowed to use first class amenities. However, the flight attendant might have specific rules about who can use which bathrooms for safety or operational reasons. The user didn't check if they were allowed, which could be a point against them.\n\nThen there's the part where the flight attendant was being strict with other passengers too, making extra announcements. Maybe the user's action triggered her because she was already on edge. But that doesn't excuse the flight attendant from being rude, but the user walked away when being spoken to.\n\nThe user interrupted the flight attendant's lecture by saying \"thank you\" and walked away. The flight attendant followed and called them rude. The user's action of walking away could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the flight attendant was doing her job, even if the tone was harsh.\n\nBut the user's defense is that they were tired and didn't want to engage. However, flight attendants have a duty to enforce rules, and the user's response might have been dismissive. Even if the flight attendant was being a bit overbearing, cutting her off and leaving could be seen as the user's fault.\n\nAnother angle: if the user didn't know the policy, they might have made a mistake. But since they've used the first class bathroom before, maybe they should have been aware. Or maybe the policy changed. Either way, the user's reaction to walk away when being addressed might be the bigger issue here.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone who's talking to you is generally considered rude. Even if the person is being unpleasant, the appropriate response is to listen or politely decline. So the user's action of walking away and ignoring the flight attendant might be in the wrong.\n\nSo putting it all together: The user might have made a mistake by using the bathroom without checking the policy, but the main issue is walking away and being disrespectful to the flight attendant. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
