I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in business or economy class. The author says they used the first class bathroom because there was a long line in the back and no line in first. The flight attendant got upset and followed them to lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline rules. Do airlines allow non-first class passengers to use the first class bathroom? I think some do, especially if there's space. But maybe there are specific policies. If the flight attendant said it's against the rules, then the author might be wrong. But if there's no rule against it, maybe not. The author mentions they've done it before without issue, which might imply the airline allows it. \n\nThen there's the interaction. The flight attendant was being strict, maybe even unnecessarily. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary. When the FA followed them and yelled about rudeness, the author ignored her. Is walking away rude? If the FA was doing their job, you might be expected to listen. But if the lecture felt unfair or they were being aggressive, the author's reaction might be understandable. \n\nAlso, the context: the FA was acting oddly, strict with rules. The author had a long day and didn't want to listen. Walking away after saying \"thank you\" could be seen as dismissive. But maybe the situation was tense. \n\nHmm. The key points are whether using the bathroom was against the rules and the appropriateness of the author's response. If the FA was enforcing a rule, the author might have been wrong. But if there's no rule, then the FA overstepped. The author's response\u2014walking away and ignoring\u2014might be seen as rude regardless. So maybe AITA is yes or no? \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for using the bathroom if it's allowed, but walking away during a lecture is probably rude. But if the lecture was unreasonable, maybe the FA is at fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't do anything against the rules and the FA overreacted. Or A if they should've complied. Need to check airline policies. Since the author has done it before without issues, maybe it's allowed, so the FA was wrong to reprimand. Then the author's reaction was a response to being unfairly treated, so B makes sense. But walking away is rude. Hmm. Maybe a mix, but overall B.\n"
