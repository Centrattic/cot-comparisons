I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author used the first class bathroom when they are sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) then confronts them, and the author walks away. The FA follows and calls them rude. The author questions whether they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about airline regulations. Do passengers in premium seating areas have access to first class amenities? Sometimes airlines allow that, especially if you're in a seat adjacent to first class. But maybe there are specific rules about which bathrooms can be used. However, the author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That's a point in their favor\u2014consistency in the rules.\n\nThe FA's behavior seems a bit harsh. They made an unusual announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The author might have taken that as a prompt to use the nearest available bathroom, which was first class. The FA waited by the door and then reprimanded them. The author felt it was unnecessary and walked away, which the FA followed up with a public reprimand.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author violate a rule? If using the first class bathroom is allowed for their seat, then the FA's reaction is unwarranted. But if there's a rule against it, then the author is at fault. However, the author's argument is that they've done it before without issues. Also, the FA's approach was confrontational and maybe unprofessional, especially making a loud comment in front of others.\n\nThe author's response\u2014walking away and ignoring the FA\u2014could be seen as rude. But the FA's actions might have been the trigger. The question is whether the author's action was justified given the FA's behavior. Airlines have strict protocols, but if the rules weren't clearly communicated, maybe the FA is at fault too. However, the author did interrupt the FA and walked away, which could be considered impolite regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether using the first class bathroom was allowed. If it's allowed, author isn't in the wrong. If not, they are. But given that they've done it before without issues, it's possible the FA was being overly strict. However, the author's reaction of walking away and ignoring the FA might still be rude, even if the FA was wrong. So perhaps the author is partially at fault, but the question is a yes/no. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nIn airline policies, sometimes first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. If the author isn't in first class, using that bathroom could be a violation. However, if their seat is adjacent, maybe they're allowed. The ambiguity here is key. Since the author is a frequent flyer and has premier status, maybe they have access. But the FA's reaction suggests it's against policy. Without clear rules, it's hard to tell. However, the author's action of walking away when being reprimanded is rude regardless. So even if the FA was wrong, walking away is not the right response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But maybe the FA was wrong too. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A because they walked away during a reprimand, which is disrespectful. Even if the rule wasn't clear, the author's action of ignoring and walking away is rude. So the answer is A.\n"
