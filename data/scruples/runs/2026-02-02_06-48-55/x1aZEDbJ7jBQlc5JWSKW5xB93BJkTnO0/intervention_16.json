I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the author uses the first class bathroom, which the flight attendant says is incorrect. The key here is whether using the first class bathroom was actually against the rules. The author mentions they've done this before without issues, but maybe there's a policy against it. However, the user doesn't provide explicit rules, so we have to assume there's some ambiguity.\n\nThe flight attendant then confronts the author and starts lecturing. The author interrupts with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA follows and criticizes the author for walking away. The author's defense is that they had a long day and didn't want to listen, and the FA's actions felt unnecessary.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, if there's a rule against using the first class bathroom, then maybe the author is at fault for breaking it. But if it's not explicitly stated, the situation is more complex. Flight attendants have to enforce rules, even if it's inconvenient. However, the way the FA handled it\u2014following and yelling\u2014might be unprofessional too.\n\nThe author's response of walking away is rude, regardless of the situation. Cutting someone off and ignoring them is generally polite. Even if the FA was being overbearing, the appropriate response would be to politely explain why they were using the bathroom or ask for clarification. Walking away and being dismissive is inconsiderate and disrespectful to the FA's role.\n\nThe author also mentions they have premier status, which might give them certain privileges, but using the first class bathroom isn't necessarily a privilege unless the airline allows it. If the policy doesn't permit it, the author's action is a breach, and walking away compounds the issue. However, if the policy is unclear, the FA's strict enforcement could be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting and walking away is definitely rude. The FA was doing her job, albeit perhaps in an aggressive manner, but the author's reaction wasn't appropriate either. The author's justification of a long workday doesn't excuse dismissive behavior. Everyone has tough days, but it's important to handle conflicts with respect.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for both using the bathroom potentially against the rules and for the way they responded to the FA. Even if the FA's approach was harsh, the author's actions were disrespectful.\n"
