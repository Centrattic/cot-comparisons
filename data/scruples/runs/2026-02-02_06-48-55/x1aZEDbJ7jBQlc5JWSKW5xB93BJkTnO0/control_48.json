I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the economy row, right behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) got upset and started lecturing them when they came out of the bathroom. The person then walked away and was followed by the FA who called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to check the airline's rules. Do they allow non-first-class passengers to use the first class bathroom? The user mentions they've used it before without issues, which might mean it's permitted. But maybe there's an unspoken rule or specific policy. However, the user is a frequent flyer with premier status, so maybe they're used to certain privileges. \n\nThe FA acted strangely before, being strict about rules. Maybe she was in a bad mood or following new safety protocols. The user went to the bathroom because the economy line was long, and the first class one was empty. Their intention was to avoid long lines, which makes sense. \n\nWhen the FA confronted them, the user cut her off with a polite thank you and walked away. The FA then followed and criticized them for walking away. The user's response was to ignore her, which might be seen as rude, but they were stressed after a long day. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? If the airline allows using first class bathrooms for all, then the user isn't wrong. But if there's a policy against it, maybe they are. However, since they've done it before without issues, the FA's reaction might be out of the ordinary. \n\nWalking away when someone is talking might be considered impolite, but the FA was being aggressive. The user might have felt defensive. However, interrupting and walking away could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn terms of the lecture, if the FA had a valid reason, the user should have listened. But if the lecture was unnecessary, maybe the user was right to cut it off. \n\nOverall, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were following their usual practice and dealing with a difficult situation. The FA's behavior might have contributed to the tension. But walking away could still be seen as a breach of politeness. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they had a reason to avoid the long line and the FA's approach was harsh.\n"
