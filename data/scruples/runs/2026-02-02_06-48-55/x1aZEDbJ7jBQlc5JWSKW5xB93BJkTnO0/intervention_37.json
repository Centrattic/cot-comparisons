I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away when reprimanded by the flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the person uses the first class bathroom, which is not their assigned area. The flight attendant then confronts them. The user walked away, which led to the FA following them and calling them rude. \n\nI need to consider airline policies. Usually, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. The user isn't in first class, so using that bathroom might be against the rules. Even if others have done it before, that doesn't make it right. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules for safety and service standards.\n\nThen there's the part where the user walked away during the lecture. The flight attendant was doing her job, and walking away could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the user was tired, responding politely is expected in such scenarios. The FA's reaction of following and speaking loudly might be unprofessional, but the user's action of ignoring her could still be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the user has premier status. Maybe they should have known better. The FA was enforcing a rule, and the user's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The user's argument about not being reprimanded before isn't a valid excuse if the policy exists.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user violated a policy by using the wrong bathroom and then disrespected the FA by walking away. Hence, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
