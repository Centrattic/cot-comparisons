I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in economy, behind first class. The flight attendant got upset and lectured them, and the person walked away and ignored further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules about bathroom usage on airplanes. Usually, passengers are allowed to use any available bathroom, right? Unless there's a specific policy restricting economy passengers from using first class bathrooms. But the person mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the airline doesn't strictly enforce that rule. However, the flight attendant might have had a policy they were enforcing that day. \n\nThe user's argument is that there was a long line in economy, and the first class bathroom was empty. They needed to use the bathroom, so it made sense to use the closest one. But the flight attendant was strict and reprimanded them. The person then interrupted the lecture to say thanks and walked away, which led to the FA following and calling them rude.\n\nNow, the key points are: Was using the first class bathroom against the rules? If not, then the FA was wrong to lecture them. But if it's allowed, then the FA overstepped. However, the user's action of walking away when being lectured is the main issue here. Even if the FA was being unreasonable, walking away and ignoring her could be seen as rude. The FA was doing her job, and the person chose not to engage, which might be disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the person had premier status, which might give them access to first class amenities. Some airlines allow elite status members to use first class lounges and restrooms. If that's the case, then using the bathroom wasn't wrong. But the user didn't mention that specifically. They just said they're in the row behind first class and have premier status. \n\nSo, if the airline's policy allows it, the user wasn't wrong. But the FA was enforcing a rule they didn't know existed. However, the user's response of walking away and ignoring the lecture is where the issue lies. Even if the FA was wrong, the user's actions could be considered rude because they didn't let the FA finish explaining. \n\nBut the user's reasoning is that they were tired and didn't want to listen to the lecture. That's understandable, but cutting someone off and walking away is generally seen as impolite. The FA might have been trying to inform them of a policy change or a safety rule they weren't aware of. \n\nIn conclusion, the person's action of using the bathroom might not be wrong if it's allowed, but walking away from the FA while she's speaking could be considered rude. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
