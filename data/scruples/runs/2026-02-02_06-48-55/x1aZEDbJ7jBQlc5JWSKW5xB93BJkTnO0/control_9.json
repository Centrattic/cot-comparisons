I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting in the row behind first class. They used the first class bathroom before landing because there was a long line for the economy one. The flight attendant was waiting for them and started lecturing them about using the wrong bathroom. The author then walked away and ignored further comments, leading the FA to call them rude.\n\nNow, to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the rules. Airlines have specific regulations about bathroom usage. First class bathrooms are for first class passengers unless the economy ones are unavailable. If the author is in economy, using the first class bathroom when there's a line for the economy one might be against the rules. However, the author mentions they've done this before without issues. Maybe the rules vary by airline or aren't strictly enforced. \n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. The FA was acting unusually strict, reprimanding passengers for small things. She made an announcement for people to use the bathroom now, leading to a rush. The author used the first class bathroom, which was closer and not busy. The FA then followed the author and continued lecturing. The author's response was to walk away and ignore her, which is where the question is.\n\nIs walking away from someone who's lecturing you rude? The author felt that the lecture was unnecessary and didn't want to engage. However, in a professional setting like an airline, passengers are expected to comply with staff instructions. The FA was doing her job, so interrupting and walking away might be seen as disrespectful. But the FA's approach was aggressive and loud, which could have escalated the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's intent: they had a long day and didn't want to deal with the lecture. That's understandable, but does that justify walking away? The author didn't apologize or explain. Maybe a better approach would be to acknowledge the FA's point and move on, rather than ignoring her in front of others, which could be perceived as rude.\n\nBut then, the FA was following them and speaking loudly, which might have embarrassed the author. The author might have felt that the FA was overstepping. However, flight attendants have to enforce rules, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author might have broken a rule by using the first class bathroom when they shouldn't, leading to the FA's reprimand. But the FA's handling of the situation was poor, and her public shaming might have been unprofessional. The author's response of walking away and ignoring could be seen as rude, especially in a public space where cooperation is expected. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the rules clearly prohibit using the first class bathroom unless upgraded, then the author is at fault for violating the rule. However, if the rules aren't clear or if the FA never enforced them before, maybe the FA is at fault. \n\nIn most cases, airlines do have strict rules about bathroom usage. So the author might have been in the wrong for using the first class bathroom. Then, when confronted, walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as rude, even if they felt the FA was being harsh. The appropriate response would be to apologize, even if they disagree, to maintain a respectful interaction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they used the wrong bathroom against the rules and then disrespected the FA by ignoring her.\n"
