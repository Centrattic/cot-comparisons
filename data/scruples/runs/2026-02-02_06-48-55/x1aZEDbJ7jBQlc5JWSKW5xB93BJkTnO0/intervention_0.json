I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a frequent flyer who used the first class bathroom even though they're in the row behind it. The flight attendant got upset and lectured them, and the author walked away and ignored her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has premier status, so maybe they have some privileges. They used the first class bathroom when there was a long line in their own section. The flight attendant was strict, maybe overstepping. The author interrupted the lecture and left. Then the FA followed and accused them of being rude.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? Are there rules against that? If the airline allows premier customers to use first class amenities, then maybe not. But if there are specific rules about only first class passengers using that bathroom, then the author might be wrong.\n\nThe author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the policy is not strictly enforced. However, in this case, the FA was strict. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate or violating an unspoken rule. The FA's reaction was harsh, but the author's response of walking away and ignoring her is also a problem. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting and walking away is rude. The FA was doing their job, even if they were being overbearing. The author's choice to ignore the FA and get defensive might be the main issue here. Even if the FA was wrong, the way the author handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for using the bathroom if it's allowed, but their reaction to the FA's lecture is definitely inconsiderate. The main question is whether using the first class bathroom was a violation. If the airline's policy allows it, then the author isn't wrong. If it's against the rules, then maybe. But the story says the author has done it before without issues, implying it's allowed. However, the FA's strictness here might be a one-off. \n\nThe real issue is the author walking away and ignoring the FA. That's definitely rude, regardless of the situation. So even if the bathroom use wasn't wrong, the author's response was. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because of their disrespectful behavior towards the FA, even if the initial bathroom use was acceptable.\n"
