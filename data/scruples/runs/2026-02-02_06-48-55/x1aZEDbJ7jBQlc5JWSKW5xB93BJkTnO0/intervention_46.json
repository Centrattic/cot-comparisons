I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person uses the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class. The flight attendant (FA) is already known to be strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture, so they walked away after a brief acknowledgment.\n\nSo, the key points here. The airline's rules probably state that economy passengers can't use first class bathrooms unless upgraded. The FA's announcement might have been a safety protocol to ensure everyone is in their seats for landing. The author used the first class bathroom, which could be against the rules. The FA then confronts them, the author responds with a polite \"thank you\" and walks away, then ignores further comments.\n\nNow, the author's defense is that they've used the front bathroom before without issues and that the FA was being overly harsh. But the FA might have a rule to enforce, and the author's action could be seen as a violation. However, the FA's response might have been excessive, especially if the author had done it before without problems. \n\nThe author's reaction: interrupting with a \"thank you\" and walking away. That's seen as dismissive. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, walking away mid-conversation and then ignoring the FA's follow-up could be considered rude. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the passenger's respect is expected. \n\nSo, the author's actions during the interaction might breach the expected etiquette, even if the initial action (using the bathroom) wasn't a major violation. The key here is whether the author's response was disrespectful. The FA was trying to address a potential policy breach, and the author's dismissal could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut another angle: if the author has done this before without issues, maybe the FA was being inconsistent. However, as a customer, one should comply with staff instructions even if they think the policy is being inconsistently applied. The author might have had prior experiences, but that doesn't excuse current non-compliance.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away when someone is speaking to you is generally considered impolite. The author acknowledged the FA with a \"thank you\" but then left, which could be seen as a way to avoid the lecture. The follow-up comment from the FA about rudeness makes sense in that context.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The author might be in the wrong for walking away and not engaging respectfully. Even if they felt the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response would be to listen, apologize if necessary, and comply. The author's action was disrespectful, so they are at least partially at fault. However, if the FA was indeed being overly strict, the author might have a point, but their response was inappropriate. \n\nFinal verdict: The author is in the wrong for their reaction, so answer A.\n"
