I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the main cabin. The person has premier status and is in a seat right behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the main bathroom but not for the first class one, so they used the first class bathroom. The flight attendant confronted them, they said thanks and walked away, then the FA followed and called them rude for walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to check if using the first class bathroom is against the rules. The user mentions they've done it before without issues. Maybe the airline allows it unless there's a specific policy. If there's no rule against it, then the flight attendant's reprimand might be unwarranted. However, sometimes there are unspoken policies or rules that aren't commonly known. But the user didn't know there was a rule against it, so maybe they didn't break any explicit policy.\n\nThen, the flight attendant was acting strangely, being strict with other passengers. Maybe she was overstepping. The user's reaction was to walk away after being lectured, which the FA saw as rude. The user's defense is that they were tired and didn't want to engage. But walking away when someone is talking to you can be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. However, if the flight attendant was being aggressive or unnecessary, the user might have a point in disengaging.\n\nThe key points: Did the user break a rule? If not, the FA's reaction was unwarranted. Also, the user's response of walking away might be rude, but if the FA was being unreasonable, maybe it's justified. The user's status as a frequent flyer might add context\u2014maybe they expected some leeway. But flight attendants have to enforce rules regardless of passenger status. However, if there's no rule, enforcing it would be wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. Since the user has done it before without issues, it's possible the airline allows it. In that case, the FA's lecture was inappropriate, and the user isn't in the wrong for walking away. But if there's a rule they were unaware of, maybe they are in the wrong. But the user argues that no one has told them before. So, maybe the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong because they didn't break a rule and the FA was being unreasonable.\n"
