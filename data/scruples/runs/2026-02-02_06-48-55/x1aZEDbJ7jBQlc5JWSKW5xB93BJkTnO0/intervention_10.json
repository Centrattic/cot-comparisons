I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in an economy seat. The author mentions they're a frequent flyer with premier status, so they probably know the usual norms. The flight attendant was strict, maybe overzealous, and the author used the first class bathroom during a time when others were waiting in line for the back bathrooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Usually, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers, right? So if the author isn't in first class, using that bathroom might be against the rules. Even if there was no line, maybe there are unspoken rules that economy passengers should stick to their designated areas. The flight attendant's reaction could be based on policy, even if they were being a bit harsh.\n\nThen, the author walked away when the flight attendant was lecturing them. That's where the conflict escalated. The flight attendant followed and called them rude. The author's response was to ignore her. In a professional setting like an airplane, employees are expected to handle situations calmly, but passengers also have responsibilities to follow rules and respect staff. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture. But interrupting with a dismissive \"thank you\" and walking away might be seen as disrespectful. The flight attendant was doing their job, even if their tone was off. The author's action of ignoring the follow-up comment could be seen as rude because it's not polite to ignore someone when they're speaking to you, regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant's approach might have been excessive. If the author had used the bathroom earlier without issues, maybe the FA overstepped. But the key point is whether the author violated a rule by using the first class bathroom. If the policy is clear that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the author was in the wrong for using it. However, if the policy is more lenient and allows economy passengers in certain situations, maybe not. \n\nSince the author had premier status, maybe there's some leeway, but it's still possible they crossed a line. The act of walking away during a staff member's reprimand is a social faux pas. Even if the flight attendant was being too harsh, the appropriate response would be to listen or politely explain, not to cut them off and leave. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author likely broke a rule by using the wrong bathroom, and their response to the flight attendant was disrespectful. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. But maybe the flight attendant was also at fault for being overly aggressive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they violated a rule and responded poorly, the answer is probably A.\n"
