I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated just behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom or stowing carry-ons before landing. The person used the first class bathroom, which was empty, and then the FA approached them to lecture them about using the wrong bathroom. The author walked away, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's defense is that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, and the flight attendant's reaction seems harsh. The FA's side is that there might be rules about which bathrooms passengers can use, especially in different classes. There's a mention of safety regulations, but the author says they don't recall any such rules. However, airlines often have policies to prevent contamination between classes, even if it's not a safety issue per se. \n\nNow, the author interrupted the FA to say \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA then followed and called them rude. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nFrom a policy standpoint, using the first class bathroom might be against the airline's rules. Even if the author did it before without issues, that doesn't mean it's allowed. The FA is there to enforce these rules, so the author's action could be seen as disrespectful. The FA's reaction, while maybe aggressive, is about maintaining protocol.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were being unfairly targeted, especially with the FA's odd behavior towards others. However, even if the FA is having a bad day, the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA is not ideal. The author could have calmly asked for clarification about the rules instead of dismissing the FA.\n\nSo, the author's actions of walking away and ignoring the FA are considered rude and disrespectful, regardless of the FA's tone. The author's justification doesn't absolve them from being discourteous. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
