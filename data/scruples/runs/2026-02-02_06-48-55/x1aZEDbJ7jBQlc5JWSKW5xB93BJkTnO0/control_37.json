I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as a premium passenger and then walking away when scolded by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user has premier status, which often comes with perks, but does that include access to first class facilities? Some airlines allow their elite members to use first class lounges and amenities, but during the flight itself, maybe the bathrooms are restricted. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe the rules aren't absolute or it's at the discretion of the crew. \n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. The user describes the FA as acting strangely, being strict with other passengers, and making an unusual announcement. If the FA made a specific announcement about using the bathroom now, maybe the user's action was against that, but maybe it's just a standard pre-landing announcement. Also, the user interrupted the FA's lecture, which could be seen as rude. \n\nThe user's response to the lecture: walking away after saying \"thank you for telling me.\" That might come off as dismissive. The FA followed them and called them rude, which adds to the tension. But the user felt the lecture was unnecessary and after a long day, was frustrated. \n\nLegally, safety regulations might require certain bathroom usage for safety reasons, like keeping aisles clear. But if the user is an elite passenger, maybe they're allowed exceptions. However, the FA's job is to enforce the rules, and interrupting them could be unprofessional. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as respectful if they're within their rights, but dismissive if they're not following guidelines. The key points are: Did the user violate any rules by using the first class bathroom? Is walking away from an employee during a lecture considered rude or disrespectful? \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether using the first class bathroom is allowed. If the user is a premier member, maybe it's permitted, but if the FA made a specific rule that day, it's not. But since the user has done it before without issues, maybe the FA was overstepping. However, the user walking away might still be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the validity of the lecture. So the user might be partly at fault for not addressing the issue calmly. But if they were correct in their action, the FA was wrong to escalate it. \n\nThe FA's reaction seems harsh, but the user's interruption and walking away could be seen as rude regardless of the circumstances. So maybe the answer is A, the user is in the wrong for walking away and not engaging professionally, even if they were right about the bathroom usage.\n"
