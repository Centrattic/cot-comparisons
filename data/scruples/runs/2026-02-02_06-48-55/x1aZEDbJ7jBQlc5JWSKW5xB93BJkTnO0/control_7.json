I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom, and the author walking away mid-lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about stowing luggage and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathroom, but the first class one was empty. The author used the first class bathroom, which is allowed since they're seated nearby. The FA then confronted them, leading to the author walking away and ignoring the FA's subsequent comment about being rude.\n\nNow, considering airline rules. Airlines often have policies about bathroom use, especially in first class. Premier status might give certain privileges, but there could be specific guidelines. If the author's seat is in economy but near first class, using the first class bathroom might be permitted, as some airlines allow that for adjacent seats. However, the FA might have rules about who can use which facilities, perhaps to maintain order or safety. If the author isn't in first class, maybe they shouldn't use that bathroom, but if it's accessible for those seated nearby, it's a gray area.\n\nThe FA's behavior seems harsh. The author mentions the FA was already strict with other passengers. The announcement about bathroom use before landing is standard, but the FA's approach might have been overly strict. Using the first class bathroom when available could be seen as reasonable given the long line elsewhere. However, the author's decision to walk away mid-conversation is problematic. Even if the FA was being rude, interrupting and walking away is not polite and could escalate the situation. Disrespecting a crew member, regardless of their attitude, might not be the best approach, as they have authority for safety reasons.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That suggests maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced. But the FA's job is to enforce rules, so even if previous instances were overlooked, the rule might still require compliance. However, the author didn't cause harm, just inconvenience, and might have thought they were helping by using an available resource.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away when someone is talking to you is considered rude. The FA followed up with a comment about rudeness, which the author ignored. While the FA's tone was harsh, the author's response was also uncooperative. There's a balance here between standing up for oneself and maintaining respect.\n\nLegally and according to airline protocols, if using the first class bathroom was against the rules, the author is in the wrong. If it's allowed, then the FA overstepped. The ambiguity here is key. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is flexible, but if they violated a rule, they are at fault. Since the author mentions they've used it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't clear. However, the FA's role is to enforce rules, so even if inconsistent, the author should comply.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of walking away was rude regardless of the FA's approach. However, the FA's behavior was also excessive. The main issue is the author's response: interrupting and walking away is a breach of etiquette. So, the author is partly in the wrong for their response, even if the FA was being unreasonable.\n"
