I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when seated in the row behind first class, and then walking away when a flight attendant lectured them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The writer mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, but now the flight attendant is upset. Maybe there are specific rules about where passengers can use bathrooms based on their seating class. Even if the writer has done it before, the FA might have a rule against it for safety or security reasons, like ensuring first class passengers aren't blocked or that emergencies can be managed. The user says the FA was following protocol here.\n\nThen there's the interaction part. The FA approached the writer and started lecturing them. The writer interrupts with a polite \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA then follows and criticizes them for walking away. The writer's main argument is that they didn't feel like listening to what they saw as an unnecessary lecture after a long day. But in a professional setting, especially in a service job, employees expect some level of respect from customers. Walking away mid-conversation could be seen as disrespectful, even if the person is annoyed. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the writer's reaction might have been dismissive or rude.\n\nAlso, the writer acknowledges that flight attendants have hard jobs but still felt justified in their actions. The key here is whether the writer's response was appropriate. The FA was doing her job, and while the tone might have been harsh, the writer's choice to walk away and ignore the follow-up could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the rules are unclear, engaging respectfully is usually the expected behavior. So, while the FA might have been strict, the writer's response was not the best approach.\n"
