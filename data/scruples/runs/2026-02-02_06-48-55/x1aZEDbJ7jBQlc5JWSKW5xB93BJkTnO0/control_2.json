I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as a premium member when a flight attendant later reprimands them for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The user mentions they have premier status and often sit behind first class. They used the first class bathroom when there was a long line in the back. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The user argues they've done this before without issues, but this time the FA followed them and called them rude.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the user violate any rules? If the airline allows premier members to use first class amenities, then no. However, if the FA's strictness was due to specific regulations (like safety during landing phase), maybe the user broke a rule. The user interrupted the FA, walked away, and ignored her. That's probably where the issue lies.\n\nEven if using the bathroom was allowed, walking away and ignoring someone when they're speaking, especially an authority figure like a flight attendant, is generally considered rude. The FA's job is to ensure safety and enforce rules. The user's response could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of their stress from a long day.\n\nAlso, the user had been using the first class bathroom before without issues, so maybe this FA was stricter. But the user's reaction of dismissing the lecture and not engaging might come off as dismissive of the FA's role. Even if the user felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation after being reprimanded. The action of walking away and ignoring the FA's feedback is likely the issue here. They could have asked for clarification or acknowledged the FA's point calmly. The FA's follow-up comment about rudeness suggests that the user's behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
