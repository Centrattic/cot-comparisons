I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're in economy class, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author has premier status and sits behind first class. They used the first class bathroom before landing because the economy bathrooms were busy. The flight attendant then lectured them, and the author walked away, leading to the FA following and calling them rude.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author do something against the rules? Usually, airlines have policies about which bathrooms passengers can use. If the author isn't in first class, using that bathroom might be against the rules. Even if they've done it before without issues, that doesn't make it right. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so their reaction might be justified.\n\nThen there's the part where the author walked away while the FA was talking. The FA followed and called them rude. In a professional setting, especially in customer service, how you respond matters. Interrupting and walking away could be seen as disrespectful, even if stressed. The author mentions they were tired, but that's not an excuse for rude behavior.\n\nThe author argues that the FA was being overly strict before, but that doesn't negate their own actions. The FA's job is to maintain order and safety. If the author used the wrong bathroom, they should correct it politely. Walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as insubordinate.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's approach might have been harsh. If they were already strict with other passengers, maybe their reaction was inconsistent. But the main issue is the author's response. Even if stressed, cutting the FA off and walking away is not appropriate. The FA was doing their job, and the author's response was dismissive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author violated a rule by using the first class bathroom, and then reacted rudely when confronted. Even if the FA was strict, the author's actions were disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
