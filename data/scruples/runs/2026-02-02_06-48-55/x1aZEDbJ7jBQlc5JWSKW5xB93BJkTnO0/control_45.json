I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when seated in economy, which leads to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions using the first class bathroom before, with no issues. But maybe there's a rule against it. Even if there's no explicit rule, flight attendants might enforce certain protocols for safety or operational reasons. The flight attendant could be maintaining boundaries to prevent economy passengers from using first class facilities, which might be against company policy.\n\nThen, the author's actions. They went to the bathroom when there was a long line in economy but a free one in first class. The flight attendant waited by the door and then lectured them. The author walked away and ignored further comments. Walking away when someone is talking to you, especially in a public setting, can be seen as rude. Even if the lecture was unwarranted, interrupting and walking off might escalate the situation. The flight attendant might have been doing their job, so the author's response could be disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the flight attendant's behavior was also questionable. She was already acting strictly towards passengers, making extra announcements. Her following the author and speaking loudly in front of others could be unprofessional. The author might have felt the lecture was unnecessary, especially since they hadn't been reprimanded before.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author violated any rules. If using first class amenities is against the airline's policy, then the author is at fault. If not, the FA overstepped. The author's decision to walk away and ignore the FA could be seen as dismissive. Even if the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response might have been to politely explain or ask for clarification, not walk away.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, cutting someone off and walking away is generally considered rude. The author's justification about a long day might not excuse that behavior. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and responding with respect is expected, regardless of personal feelings.\n\nSo, considering the possible violation of policies and the disrespectful response, the author might be in the wrong. But if there's no policy against using first class bathrooms, then the FA was being excessive. The author's reaction is also a factor. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if there's a rule broken, the author is at fault. If not, maybe the FA is. But the story doesn't specify any explicit rule, so maybe the author is in the right. Hmm, tricky. I think the main issue is the author walking away, which is rude regardless. So answer A.\n"
