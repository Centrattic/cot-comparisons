I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away when confronted by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author uses the first class bathroom, which is allowed for premier status passengers, I assume. The flight attendant was already strict with other passengers, and the author felt the lecture was unnecessary. The main conflict is the interaction after using the bathroom.\n\nSo, the author used the bathroom that's permitted for them, right? But the flight attendant was waiting and gave a lecture. The author walked away, which led to the FA following and calling them rude. The question is whether walking away was the wrong move.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, walking away when someone is talking to you isn't typically considered polite. Even if the speaker is being confrontational, interrupting and leaving might be seen as dismissive. However, the author did apologize and then left. The FA continued to follow and escalate the situation, which might be on her part.\n\nBut maybe the FA had a valid reason to address the issue. If the author was in the wrong for using the first class bathroom without permission, even if they have status, then the author's actions would be at fault. But the author mentions having premier status and that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the FA was being inconsistent or overly strict.\n\nAlso, the context of the flight attendant's behavior towards other passengers is important. If she's been reprimanding people for small things, maybe she's in a bad mood or not following protocol. The author's action of walking away could be justified as self-preservation after a long day, but it's still not the most respectful response.\n\nIn terms of regulations, maybe using the first class bathroom isn't against the rules for premier members. If that's the case, the FA shouldn't have reprimanded the author. The author's response might have been a reaction to being treated unfairly. However, the act of walking away could be seen as rude regardless of the context.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The flight attendant's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's actions, while not perfect, were a response to an unnecessary confrontation. However, interrupting and walking away isn't ideal. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they followed their usual protocol and the FA was being unreasonable.\n"
