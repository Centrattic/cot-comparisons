I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the premium economy row, right behind first class. The flight attendant got upset and lectured them, and the author walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Do they allow premium passengers to use first class bathrooms? The author mentions they have premier status and sometimes get seats behind first class. Maybe the policy is that only first class passengers can use that bathroom. If that's the case, the author did violate a rule. But the user also said they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced every time, or there's some ambiguity.\n\nThen there's the flight attendant's behavior. The author describes the FA as acting bizarrely, strict with rules, and making extra announcements. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary after a long day. When the FA followed them and said it's rude to walk away, that's a conflict. The author's response was to ignore her after the lecture.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, walking away while someone is talking to you might be considered rude. Even if you don't agree with their criticism, cutting them off and leaving could be seen as disrespectful. However, the FA's approach might have been part of the issue. If the FA was being overly aggressive or unreasonable, the author's reaction might be more understandable.\n\nBut the main question is if the author was in the wrong. If using the first class bathroom was against the rules, then yes, they did something wrong. However, if the rules are unclear or inconsistently enforced, the fault might be shared. Also, the FA's loud reprimand in public could have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nThe author's action of walking away was a response to what they felt was an unfair lecture. But interrupting the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and leaving could be seen as dismissive. The key points are: 1) Did the author violate a clear policy? 2) Was their response appropriate given the situation?\n\nIf the airline allows premium status holders to use first class amenities, then the author isn't wrong. If not, then they broke the rules. Since they mentioned the FA didn't stop them before, it's possible the policy isn't strictly enforced. However, the FA's job is to enforce rules, so the author's action might still be considered a violation.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away is rude regardless of the reason. But considering the FA's behavior, maybe the author had a valid reason. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the rule was clear and if the FA was overstepping.\n"
