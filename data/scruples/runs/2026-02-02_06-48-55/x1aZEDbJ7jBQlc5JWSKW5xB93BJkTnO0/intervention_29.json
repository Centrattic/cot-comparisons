I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in economy class, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The author mentions they have premier status and often get seats near first class. They used the first class bathroom without being upgraded. Airline rules typically restrict first class amenities to first class passengers. Even if the bathroom is accessible, using it might be against the rules. The flight attendant likely has a duty to enforce these policies.\n\nThe author says they've used the front bathroom before without issues, but maybe this time the FA was stricter. The key point is whether the author's action violated any clear policy. If there's a rule against it, then the author is at fault for not following it. The FA's reaction, while maybe harsh, is about enforcing rules. \n\nThen, when the FA approached, the author interrupted her and walked away. The FA followed and criticized their rudeness. Walking away mid-conversation, especially when being corrected, could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and walking away is impolite. The FA's job is to maintain order, so the author's reaction might have been uncooperative. \n\nAlso, considering the context\u2014the author had a long day, but that doesn't excuse ignoring rules or being rude. The FA's job is stressful, and the author's actions might have added to her stress. The author's response was to dismiss the FA's instructions, which isn't helpful. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely broke a policy by using the first class bathroom and responded inappropriately when confronted. So, they are in the wrong.\n"
