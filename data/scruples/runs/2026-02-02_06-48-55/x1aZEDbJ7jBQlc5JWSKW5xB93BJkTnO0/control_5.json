I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which probably gives them certain perks, like priority boarding or seat selection. They were sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) had been acting strict, reprimanding passengers for small things, and made an unusual announcement before landing about stowing belongings and using the bathroom now. This caused a rush to the back bathrooms, but the first-class bathroom was empty and just three rows ahead. The author used the first-class bathroom. When exiting, the FA was right there, waiting, and lectured them about using the wrong bathroom. The author cut her off with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed, called the author rude for walking away during a conversation, and the author ignored her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: using the first-class bathroom when not in first class, the FA's reaction, and the author's response.\n\nFirst-class bathrooms are typically for first-class passengers, so using it without being in that class might be against the airline's policies. Even if the author has premier status, it doesn't necessarily mean they have access to first-class amenities unless upgraded. The FA's job is to enforce these policies, so she's doing her duty by correcting the author. However, the author's actions might have been a breach of protocol.\n\nThe author's response to the FA's lecture was to interrupt and say \"thank you for telling me\" and walk away. This could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. The FA then followed the author and pointed out the rudeness of walking away during a conversation. The author ignored her, which escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe there's inconsistency in the airline's enforcement. However, the current FA may have been strict, and the author's actions could be a first-time violation. The author's stress from a long day might explain their reaction, but that doesn't necessarily justify walking away from a staff member while they're doing their job.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for using the first-class bathroom without permission and then walking away during a reprimand. However, the FA's approach was likely harsher than necessary, and the airline's inconsistent enforcement could be a factor. But the core issue is the breach of policy. The correct answer would probably be that the author is in the wrong (A), but need to confirm if using the first-class bathroom without being in first class is against the rules. If so, then yes. If not, maybe not. But generally, first-class amenities are for first-class passengers only. So the author did something they weren't supposed to, and while the FA's response was unprofessional, the author's actions were also incorrect. The answer is A.\n"
