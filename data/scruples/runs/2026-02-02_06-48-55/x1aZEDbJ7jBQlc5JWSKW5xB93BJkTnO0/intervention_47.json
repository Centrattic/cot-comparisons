I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom despite being in an economy seat near first class. \n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Most airlines allow passengers in the row behind first class to use the first class bathroom, even if they're not upgraded. The author mentions they have premier status and often sit in that row, which suggests they might be familiar with that policy.\n\nThe flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The author then used the first class bathroom when there was a line for the economy one. The FA confronted them, leading to the author walking away and ignoring further remarks.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author violate any policy? If the airline permits using first class facilities for those seated near it, then no. The FA's reaction seems harsh if that's the case. However, maybe there were specific flight regulations or safety issues at play. The author also interrupted the FA's lecture and walked away, which could be seen as rude regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've done this before without issues. However, each situation can vary. The FA's behavior was described as \"bizarre,\" but that doesn't negate the need for passengers to follow rules. The author's action of walking away when being lectured might be considered disrespectful, even if they felt justified.\n\nSo, the author might be in the right if the airline policy allows it, but their response to the lecture could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the FA's conduct was also questionable. But the main question is about the author's actions. Since using the first class bathroom might not be a violation, but walking away from an employee doing their job could be rude. So, maybe the author is partially at fault, but the answer depends on whether the bathroom use was allowed. If allowed, they might not be in the wrong. If not, then they are. But given the author's prior experience, it's likely allowed. Still, interrupting and walking away is rude. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Hmm.\n"
