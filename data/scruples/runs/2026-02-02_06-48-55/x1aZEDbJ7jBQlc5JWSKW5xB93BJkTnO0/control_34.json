I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post did something wrong by using the first class bathroom and then walking away when confronted.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is in an economy seat right behind first class. There's a long line for the economy bathroom, but the first class bathroom is only three rows ahead. They use the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. The flight attendant then confronts them, gives a lecture, and the person walks away, leading to more confrontation.\n\nSo, the main points here. Airline policies usually specify that first class amenities are for first class passengers. However, the user mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without being reprimanded. That's a bit conflicting. If the policy allows it, maybe there's no issue. But if it's against the rules, then maybe the user is wrong.\n\nBut wait, the user has premier status and is often in seats near first class. Maybe the airline allows access to first class amenities for elite members. If that's the case, then using the bathroom isn't against the rules. The flight attendant might have been inconsistent with enforcement.\n\nThe next part is the confrontation. The flight attendant followed the user to their seat and spoke loudly, which could be unprofessional. The user walked away after a lecture, which might be seen as rude, but if the lecture was unwarranted, the user's reaction could be justified. \n\nThe user's reasoning: they were in a hurry, had a long day, and the flight attendant's behavior seemed overly strict. They interrupted the lecture to thank her and left. The FA then followed up with a public reprimand.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if using the bathroom was allowed, then the user isn't wrong. If not, then maybe they are. But since there's inconsistency in enforcement (no one else was reprimanded), it's possible the FA was being unfair. The user's response of walking away could be seen as rude, but if the FA was being unprofessional, the user might not be entirely at fault.\n\nAlso, the flight attendant's actions of following and speaking loudly might be more inconsiderate. The user's choice to disengage might be a reasonable response to an uncomfortable situation. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong here.\n"
