I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. Typically, first class bathrooms are reserved for first class passengers. If the person is in economy, using a first class bathroom might be against the rules. However, the user mentions they have premier status and sit right behind first class. Maybe they've done this before without issues. But just because it's been done before doesn't mean it's allowed. The flight attendant's job is to enforce the rules, so even if they're strict, their instructions should be followed.\n\nThen, when the flight attendant approached, the user interrupted with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. Interrupting someone, even if they're being harsh, isn't polite. The user had the choice to either comply or at least listen. Walking away and ignoring the attendant could be seen as rude. The attendant followed them and called them out for being rude, which might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nThe user's argument is that the flight attendant was being overly strict. But regardless of the attendant's demeanor, the user's action of walking away and ignoring them might still be inconsiderate. The flight attendant's job involves maintaining order, and disregarding their instructions could make their job harder, even if the user didn't intend to.\n\nSo, while the flight attendant's approach might not have been perfect, the user's response was also uncooperative. The user could have acknowledged the mistake without confrontation. Therefore, the user might be partly at fault for not handling the situation more maturely.\n"
