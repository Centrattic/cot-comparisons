I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as a regular passenger and then walking away when a flight attendant gave a lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. The author mentions using the first class bathroom before without issues. But maybe there's a policy against regular passengers using first class amenities. If that's the case, the flight attendant is just doing their job by correcting the author. However, the author points out that they've done this before without problems, which suggests inconsistency in enforcement.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. She was already acting strangely, being strict with other passengers. Her approach to the author was confrontational, following them and speaking loudly. That might be unprofessional, but the author also walked away when the FA was trying to communicate. Walking away when someone is addressing you can be seen as rude, regardless of the situation. The author's response of \"thank you for telling me\" and then ignoring further comments seems dismissive.\n\nThe author's justification is their exhaustion and the FA's harshness. However, even if the FA was being a bit too aggressive, the appropriate response would be to listen politely, even if one disagrees. The key points here are adherence to rules and professional conduct. Using the first class bathroom might be against the rules, making the author at fault. Alternatively, if the rules allow it, the FA's handling was poor. The story doesn't clarify the rules, but the author's prior experience suggests it's allowed. However, the FA might have specific guidelines they have to follow. The author's decision to walk away after being addressed is likely where they are in the wrong, as it's disrespectful and escalates the situation. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of their dismissive and rude behavior towards the flight attendant, even if the FA's approach was harsh. Alternatively, if the use of the bathroom was permitted, the FA might have overstepped. But the question is about the author's actions, so the walking away part is the main issue here.\n"
