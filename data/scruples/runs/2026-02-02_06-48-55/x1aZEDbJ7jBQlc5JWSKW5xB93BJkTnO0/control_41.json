I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated behind it, and then getting lectured by a flight attendant, which they walked away from.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That might suggest that the airline doesn't have a strict policy against it. However, flights have safety regulations and procedures. Maybe the flight attendant was enforcing a rule that wasn't clear to the passenger. \n\nThe flight attendant's behavior seems a bit harsh. They were already acting strangely, reprimanding others for minor things. The user's action of using the first class bathroom might be within their rights if there's no explicit rule against it. But if the flight attendant believes it's against the rules, then the user might be technically in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the user's response to the lecture is the main point here. They interrupted the FA to say thank you and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. Is walking away justified? If the user felt the lecture was unnecessary or the FA was being unreasonable, maybe they felt justified. But from the FA's perspective, they were doing their job and the passenger was being disrespectful by not listening.\n\nAlso, considering the FA's job is hard, they need to handle many passengers and enforce rules. Disrespecting them could lead to more issues. But the FA's reaction was loud and public, which might have been over the top. \n\nSo the user's action of walking away might be seen as rude because they didn't let the FA finish their explanation. However, if the user had a valid reason (like the bathroom being available and the lecture being unwarranted), maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the key point is whether the user had a right to use the first class bathroom. If the airline allows it, then the user is not wrong. But if it's against the rules, then they are. The user's history of using it before without issues suggests it's allowed. But the FA's sudden enforcement might be a new rule. \n\nIn terms of the interaction, the user didn't want to listen and walked away. That's disrespectful to the FA's role. But if the FA was being unreasonable, the user might feel justified. \n\nOverall, the user's action of walking away might be seen as wrong because they didn't engage respectfully, but the FA's handling of the situation was also poor. The user might not be entirely at fault if they had a right to use the bathroom. But the way they responded could be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the answer is B, No, because the user's action was a response to an unnecessary lecture, but the FA's behavior was also unprofessional. But I need to decide based on typical perspectives. If the user technically wasn't violating any rules, then they're not wrong. If they were, then they are. Since the user says they've done it before without issues, maybe they're not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
