I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as a non-first class passenger, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. Flight attendants are trained to enforce rules for safety and order. Using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger might be against the airline's regulations. The author mentioned they've done this before without issues, but that doesn't make it right. Policies can change, or maybe others were more lenient. The key point is whether the author violated a rule. If so, they might be at fault for not following the rules.\n\nNext, the author's response to the flight attendant. When the FA lectured them, the author walked away and ignored the follow-up comments about rudeness. Confrontations in such settings can escalate quickly. Even if the FA's tone was harsh, walking away mid-conversation is generally considered disrespectful. The author could have acknowledged the mistake and apologized, even if they felt it was a minor issue. Ignoring the FA and walking off might be seen as dismissive and unprofessional, especially in a service environment where de-escalation is important.\n\nThe author's justification is that the flight attendant was already strict and acting strangely. While that might explain some frustration, it doesn't excuse the behavior. The FA's job is to ensure compliance, and the author's actions could be seen as making their job harder, even if unintentionally. The author also has premier status, which might come with certain expectations of behavior, so their actions could reflect poorly on their status.\n\nHowever, the FA's approach was also questionable. Using a loud voice in a confined space could be unprofessional. But the author's choice to not engage and walk away is still a problem. In professional settings, even if you're upset, it's better to respond calmly. The author's action of walking away could be seen as rude, hence the FA's follow-up comment. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author used the \"wrong\" bathroom against possible rules and responded in a way that escalated the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for both violating a potential rule and for their disrespectful response.\n"
