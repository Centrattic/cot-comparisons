I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away from a lecture by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have premier status, which might give them certain privileges, but the flight attendant's rules are clear. The key points are whether the author followed the airline's policies. Using the first class bathroom without being in first class could be against the rules, even if no one has stopped them before. The flight attendant's reaction suggests that it's not allowed, so the author might have violated a policy. \n\nThen there's the part where the author walks away when the FA is lecturing them. The FA was doing their job, and interrupting or walking away could be seen as disrespectful. The FA followed them and called them out for being rude. Even if the author was stressed, the response of walking away and ignoring the FA might be inappropriate. \n\nThe author argues that the FA was being overly strict before, but that doesn't necessarily justify their actions. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the author's choice to use the first class bathroom might have been a breach of policy. Also, the FA's loud comment about rudeness was in public, which could be unprofessional, but the author's action of walking away was still a breach of etiquette.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author probably broke a rule by using the first class bathroom and then was rude by walking away. So they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
