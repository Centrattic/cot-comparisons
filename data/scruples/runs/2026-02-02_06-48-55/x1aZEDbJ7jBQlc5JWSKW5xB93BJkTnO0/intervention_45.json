I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them for using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the context: They're a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting behind first class. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathroom, but the first class one was empty. They used it, then the FA confronted them. The person interrupted with a thank you and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude.\n\nSo, the key points. Were they supposed to use the first class bathroom? Airline policies usually allow first class passengers to use their bathrooms, but regular passengers might not be allowed. The user wasn't in first class, just sitting behind it. So maybe they violated a rule by using it. However, the FA didn't stop them before, only after. The user might not have known the policy, but if they were told beforehand, using it could be a mistake.\n\nThen, when reprimanded, they walked away. The FA was angry and followed them, making a scene. The user's response was to ignore further lectures. The question is about whether the user was wrong to walk away.\n\nThe user's defense is that the FA was being unnecessarily harsh and they had a long day. But the FA's job is to enforce rules for safety and order. Even if the user didn't know the rules, once told, they should comply. Walking away when being spoken to, especially in a public area, could be seen as disrespectful, even if the FA was harsh. The user might have handled it differently, like calmly asking for clarification, but walking away and ignoring the FA could be inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's approach might have been inappropriate\u2014yelling in a public space. However, the user's action of walking away might still be considered rude regardless of the FA's tone. So the user might be in the wrong for not addressing the situation respectfully, even if they felt the FA was being harsh.\n"
