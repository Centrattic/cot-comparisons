I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom and being lectured.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a premier status with the airline and is in the row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author used the first class bathroom, which was accessible and not busy, while the economy bathrooms were crowded. The FA then confronted the author, who walked away and was followed by the FA, who called them rude.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Airlines often have policies about first class amenities being for first class passengers only. Even if the author is a frequent flyer, they might not have access to those areas unless upgraded. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so the author could be in the wrong for using the wrong bathroom. However, sometimes airlines might be lenient, especially if the author is a valued customer. But the key point here is whether the author followed the rules.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The author didn't want to listen to the lecture and walked away. The FA followed and escalated the situation publicly. The author's action of walking away could be seen as rude, but they were responding to a lecture after using a restricted bathroom. The FA's response was to follow and publicly call them rude. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author might be wrong for using the first class bathroom if that's against the rules, and also for walking away when being addressed by a crew member. However, if the airline's policy is unclear or the author has done it before without issues, maybe the FA overreacted. But generally, following airline rules is expected. The author's action of walking away could be disrespectful, especially since the FA was doing their job. So the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
