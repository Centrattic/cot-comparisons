I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used the first class bathroom, which might not have been allowed, and then walked away when a flight attendant lectured them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. But maybe this time there was a specific reason, like the flight attendant's announcement. They said to use the bathroom now before landing. Maybe that's when they enforced the rule more strictly.\n\nThe author walked into the first class bathroom, which is behind their seat. The flight attendant was waiting there, so maybe the author was supposed to use the economy class bathroom. Even though there was a line, the flight attendant's job is to enforce the rules. The author might have broken a policy by using the wrong bathroom, even if others did it before. \n\nThen, when the flight attendant tried to talk to them, the author walked away. Interrupting and walking away could be seen as rude. The flight attendant followed them and said it was rude to walk away, which the author ignored. The author's action of walking away might have been disrespectful, even if they were tired. \n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant's approach might have been harsh, especially since the author had a long day. But the rules are in place for a reason, maybe to ensure safety and order. The author might not be in the right for ignoring the flight attendant's instructions. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the author violate a rule by using the first class bathroom? If yes, then they were in the wrong for not following the policy. Also, walking away from an authority figure's instructions could be problematic. The flight attendant's job is to manage the situation, even if their tone was off. So the author might be in the wrong for both using the wrong bathroom and walking away when confronted.\n"
