I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class. The flight attendant was upset and followed them to their seat, getting louder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Are passengers allowed to use the first class bathroom if they're not in first class? Maybe it's allowed, but maybe there are specific rules about it. The author mentions they've done it before without issues, which suggests that maybe it's permissible. But perhaps there's a protocol, like asking for permission or only during certain times. The flight attendant's announcement might have been a hint that they wanted people to use the economy bathrooms, maybe because of safety or space reasons.\n\nThen there's the interaction part. The flight attendant approached the author after they used the bathroom, lecturing them. The author responded by saying \"thank you\" and walking away. Walking away while someone is talking to you can be seen as rude, especially if the person is an authority figure like a flight attendant. The FA followed them and called them out for being rude, which escalated the situation. The author then ignored her. \n\nThe key points here are whether using the bathroom was against the rules and if walking away was disrespectful. If the rules don't prohibit using the first class bathroom, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way they handled the confrontation\u2014interrupting and walking away\u2014could be seen as dismissive and rude, regardless of the context. The flight attendant had a job to enforce rules, and the author's reaction might have made her job harder, even if unintentionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant was already acting strangely, being strict with other passengers, and the author had a long day. The lecture might have been unnecessary, and the author's response was a way to de-escalate. But even if the lecture was harsh, walking away without addressing the concern could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author's action of walking away and ignoring the flight attendant after she followed them is where they might be in the wrong. Even if they didn't break a rule, the manner in which they responded was disrespectful. So the answer might be A.\n"
