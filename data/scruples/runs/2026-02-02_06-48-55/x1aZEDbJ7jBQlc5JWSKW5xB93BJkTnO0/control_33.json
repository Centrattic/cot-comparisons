I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant lectured them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is in a seat behind first class, uses the first class bathroom, and the flight attendant confronts them. The key points are whether using the first class bathroom was allowed and how the person responded to the attendant.\n\nI know that airlines usually have specific rules about lavatory use. First class bathrooms might be for first class passengers only, even if they're in economy. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules for safety and order. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, but maybe there's a policy against it that wasn't enforced before. But the flight attendant's reaction here is a problem.\n\nThe person interrupted the flight attendant mid-lecture by saying \"thank you\" and walked away. Disrespecting or ignoring a crew member could be an issue, even if the rule is unclear. The attendant followed them and called them rude, which escalated the situation. The user claims they were tired and didn't want to listen, but cutting off a crew member's instructions isn't appropriate. \n\nAirline policies are there for a reason, and even if the person is a frequent flyer, they should follow the rules. The flight attendant's job is to maintain order, and the passenger's response was dismissive. So, the person might be in the wrong for not following protocol and for the way they responded. However, if the flight attendant was being unreasonably strict, that's on her. But the passenger's actions of walking away and ignoring the crew could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of airline regulations, using the wrong bathroom might not be a big deal, but the passenger's response escalated the conflict. The answer likely is that the author is somewhat at fault for not respecting the flight attendant's instructions and for walking away.\n"
