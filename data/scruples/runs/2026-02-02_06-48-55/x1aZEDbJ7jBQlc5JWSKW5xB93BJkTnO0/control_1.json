I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated just behind first class. During the flight, the flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom now, which caused a long line in the main cabin restroom. There was no line for the first class bathroom, which was three rows ahead. The person used the first class bathroom, and when exiting, a flight attendant was waiting and scolded them for using the wrong bathroom. The person responded with a polite interruption and walked away, ignoring further comments from the FA who called them rude.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: using the first class bathroom when not in first class, the flight attendant's reaction, and the person's response. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, are passengers allowed to use the first class bathroom if they're not in first class? I think generally, it's allowed unless there are specific restrictions. The person mentions they've used it before without issues. However, maybe there's a policy that's not well-known. The flight attendant's strict enforcement here could be the problem. If the policy is clear and the person broke it, maybe they are at fault. But if it's a grey area, the FA's reaction might be unwarranted.\n\nSecond, the flight attendant followed the person and called them rude. Even if the person did something against policy, the FA's approach was confrontational and loud, which could escalate the situation. That might be unprofessional on the FA's part.\n\nThird, the person's response: interrupting with a thank you and walking away. While the person might have been stressed, walking away when being lectured could be seen as rude, but the FA was being aggressive. The person might have felt justified in ending the interaction to avoid further conflict.\n\nConsidering these points, it's a bit of a toss-up. The person might have violated a policy, but the FA's handling was poor. The person's response was to de-escalate, which could be reasonable. So, is the person in the wrong? If the policy exists and they violated it, maybe slightly. But the FA's reaction was harsh. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the person's actions were in self-defense against an overly aggressive FA. However, if using the first class bathroom is strictly against policy, then maybe A. But given that the person has done it before without issue, the policy might be inconsistently enforced. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
