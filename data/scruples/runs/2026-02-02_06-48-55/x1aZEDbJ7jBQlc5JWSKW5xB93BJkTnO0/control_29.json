I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they did something wrong by using the first class bathroom and walking away when a flight attendant lectured them.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a seat behind first class, there's a line in the regular bathroom, but the first class bathroom is empty. They use it, then the FA confronts them. The author interrupts to say thanks and walks away, ignoring the FA's follow-up comments.\n\nSo, the main points here are about airline rules and etiquette. Do first class bathrooms have restrictions? The author mentions they've used it before without issues. Maybe the policy is that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, but the author is in economy. If that's the case, then using it is against the rules, even if not explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, the flight attendant's reaction seems harsh. The author didn't cause a safety issue; they just wanted to use a bathroom. The FA's lecture and following them might be unprofessional. The author's response of walking away might be seen as rude, but the FA's behavior was also problematic. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the airline's policy prohibits economy passengers from using first class facilities, then the author is at fault for breaking the rule. However, if the policy isn't clear or enforced, maybe not. The author's actions could be considered a minor infraction, but the FA's handling of it was poor. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting and walking away might be seen as rude, but the context is that the author had a long day and the FA was already being strict. The author's actions could be a reasonable response to an unnecessary lecture. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: The author might have broken a rule (if such a rule exists), but the FA's behavior was also unprofessional. The author's decision to walk away could be justified given the circumstances. However, the initial action of using the first class bathroom without permission is the key point. If that's against the rules, then the author is in the wrong. If it's a gray area, maybe not. \n\nSince the author mentions they've done it before without issues, maybe the policy is not strictly enforced. Still, if the airline has a rule, the author is technically in the wrong. But the FA's handling was poor. So the answer might be A (author is wrong) for violating the rule, but the FA also at fault. However, the question is only about the author's wrongdoing. So if the rule exists, answer A. If not, B. Given the context, it's more likely that first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only, so the author did something wrong by using it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
