I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away when reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them perks like seat selection. They were in a row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about stowing bags and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. The author used that bathroom, then a flight attendant confronted them and gave a lecture. The author walked away, ignoring the FA's follow-up comments about rudeness.\n\nNow, the key points here. The main issue is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. The author mentions they've done this before without issues, but maybe the airline has specific policies. Flight attendants are responsible for safety and enforcing rules, so even if it's not a safety issue, there might be protocols about which bathrooms passengers can use. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the FA was trying to address them. Walking away during a conversation is generally considered rude, regardless of the situation. However, the FA's approach might have been overly harsh, and the author might have felt justified in not engaging further due to stress from the day. But etiquette-wise, cutting someone off and ignoring their reprimand isn't polite. The author's right to use the bathroom isn't in question, but the manner in which they responded to the FA's critique is problematic. So, balancing the two sides: the FA's job is to enforce rules, and the author's right to convenience. The author's action of walking away and ignoring the follow-up comments might be considered in the wrong because they could have acknowledged the FA's concerns without engaging further.\n"
