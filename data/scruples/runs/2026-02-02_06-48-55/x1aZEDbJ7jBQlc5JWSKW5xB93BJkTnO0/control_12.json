I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away when reprimanded by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. Even if they're not explicitly stated, usually first class amenities are for first class passengers. The person is in economy but right behind first class. They might have used the first class bathroom before without issues, but the flight attendant this time was strict. \n\nThe author has premier status and often chooses seats. Maybe they're used to certain perks, but using first class facilities isn't a perk they're entitled to unless upgraded. The flight attendant's job is to enforce rules for safety and order. If the author used the wrong bathroom, even if others didn't reprimand them before, it's still a rule violation. \n\nThen there's the part where the author walks away while being lectured. The flight attendant followed and called them rude. The author might feel they were justified because they were tired, but cutting someone off and walking away could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. \n\nHowever, the flight attendant's behavior was also questionable\u2014yelling and making a scene. But the core issue is the unauthorized bathroom use. The author might not be in the wrong for using the bathroom if the rules are unclear, but if there's a clear policy against it, they are. However, the follow-up confrontation where they walked off is probably where the fault lies. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated a rule and responded inappropriately to correction, even if the attendant was harsh. But maybe B (No) if the rules weren't clearly communicated. I need to balance both. The key is whether using first class facilities is against the rules. If it's against the rules, then the FA is right to reprimand, but the author's reaction was rude. If it's not against rules, then both are at fault. The story doesn't clarify if it's explicitly against policy, but generally, first class is for first class passengers. So the author is in the wrong for using it, but the FA's handling was poor. However, the main question is about walking away and being rude. The author's action of walking away is rude regardless. So answer A.\n"
