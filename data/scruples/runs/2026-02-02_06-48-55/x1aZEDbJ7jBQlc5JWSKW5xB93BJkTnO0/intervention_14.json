I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in the row behind first class. The user is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they probably have some experience with the airline's policies.\n\nFirst, the flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The user went to the first class bathroom, which was empty, while the economy one had a line. When they came out, the FA was there and gave them a lecture. The user interrupted and walked away, then the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the rules and etiquette. Airlines usually have designated areas for passengers, especially in first class. Even though the user is in a premium seat category, they might not have access to first class lounges or facilities unless they're actually in first class. So using the first class bathroom could be against the rules. The user mentions they've done it before without issues, but maybe this time the FA was stricter.\n\nThe user's action of walking away when reprimanded could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the FA was doing their job. Even if the user was tired, cutting off the FA and ignoring them is poor etiquette. The FA was probably trying to enforce a rule, and the user's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's approach seems harsh. If the user has done it before without problems, maybe the rule isn't consistently enforced. The user might have thought it was acceptable. But still, when confronted, walking away is not the best response. The user could have listened politely and explained if needed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user might be in the wrong for using a restricted area and not handling the confrontation respectfully. The FA's job is to enforce rules, even if their method is rough. The user's interruption and walking away could have been avoided by staying to address the issue calmly. So, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
