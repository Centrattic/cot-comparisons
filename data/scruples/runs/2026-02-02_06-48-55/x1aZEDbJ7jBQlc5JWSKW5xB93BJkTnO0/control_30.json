I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy. The flight attendant told them it's the wrong bathroom, and the author walked away, ignoring further lectures. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, rules on airlines: Are passengers supposed to use only their designated bathrooms? I think in most cases, unless there's a specific restriction, passengers can use any bathroom available. Especially if it's not a full upgrade, maybe the first class bathroom is accessible to economy if it's not busy. But maybe there's a policy against it. However, the author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That suggests maybe it's not strictly enforced. \n\nThe flight attendant's reaction seems harsh. She was already acting strangely, being strict with rules. The author had a long day and didn't want to listen to a lecture. Walking away might be seen as rude, but if the FA was being unreasonable, maybe the author had a point. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author was violating a rule. If the airline allows economy passengers to use first class bathrooms when available, then the author isn't wrong. But if there's a policy against it, then maybe the author is at fault. However, since the FA didn't mention a safety issue, just a rule about bathroom usage, and the author had used it before without problem, maybe the rule isn't a strict one. \n\nAlso, the FA followed the author and made a loud comment, which escalated the situation. The author's action of walking away might be seen as defensive. The question is about whether the author was in the wrong. If there's no clear rule violation, then the author isn't wrong. If there is, then maybe they are. But given the context, the author's actions seem justified because the FA's reaction was excessive. So the answer might be B.\n"
