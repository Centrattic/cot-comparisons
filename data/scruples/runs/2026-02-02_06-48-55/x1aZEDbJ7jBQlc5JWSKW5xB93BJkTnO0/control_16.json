I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) reprimanded them for this, and the author walked away, leading to the FA calling them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. So maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, or perhaps it's allowed for non-first class passengers in certain cases. However, if the airline has a rule against non-first class passengers using that bathroom, then the author might be in the wrong for violating it.\n\nNext, the FA's behavior. The author describes the FA as acting bizarrely, being strict, and making unusual announcements. This could imply that the FA was having a bad day or was overly strict. However, flight attendants are supposed to maintain order and follow protocols. If the FA's actions were out of the ordinary or unnecessarily harsh, that's on her. But if she was just enforcing a rule, the author might have broken it.\n\nThe author's response: they interrupted the FA, said \"thank you,\" and walked away. The FA then followed them and raised her voice. The author's actions of walking away could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. Even if the FA was being harsh, interrupting and walking away might be considered rude. However, the author's justification is that they were tired and didn't want to be lectured. \n\nAnother angle: the author was in a hurry and the line was long. Using the first class bathroom when there's a line in the back could be seen as cutting the line, which might be against the rules. If the airline's policy is that passengers must use the bathroom closest to their seat unless upgraded, then the author violated that. But if there's no such policy, then it's a different story.\n\nThe FA's follow-up and loud reprimand could be unprofessional. Flight attendants should address issues quietly and respectfully. However, the author's interruption and walking away might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone who's talking to you is generally considered rude. Even if the FA was being harsh, the author's response was abrupt. The FA's comment about it being rude is valid in a general sense, though her tone might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: if the airline's policy prohibits using the first class bathroom unless you're a first class passenger, the author is in the wrong for breaking the rule. However, if the policy is flexible or the FA was being overly strict, the author's actions might be justified. The FA's response was unprofessional, but the author's walkout could still be seen as disrespectful regardless of the FA's tone.\n\nI think the key here is whether using the first class bathroom is against the airline's rules. If it is, then the author is wrong for violating it. If not, then the FA overstepped. Since the author mentions using it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, so the FA's reprimand was unwarranted. However, the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA is definitely rude, regardless of the situation. So even if the FA was wrong, the author's actions were still inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the author is partially at fault for walking away, but the FA also had issues. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be yes because they walked away, which is disrespectful, even if the FA was being harsh. But maybe the author isn't entirely wrong if the policy wasn't clearly communicated. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for their response, even if the FA was unprofessional.\n"
