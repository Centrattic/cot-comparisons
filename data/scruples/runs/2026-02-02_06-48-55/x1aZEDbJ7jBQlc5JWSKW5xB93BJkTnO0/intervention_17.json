I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in an economy seat but uses the first class bathroom. The flight attendant reprimands them, and the author walks away, then ignores further comments. The author's argument is that they didn't know it was against the rules, have done it before without issues, and were just tired after a long day.\n\nI need to consider airline policies. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. Even if the author is in a premium seat, like being near first class, using the first class bathroom might be against the rules. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules, so the author could be in the wrong for using it without permission.\n\nHowever, the author mentions they've done this before without being told off. That complicates things. Maybe the airline's policy isn't strictly enforced, or the attendants are lenient sometimes. But just because others haven't corrected it doesn't mean it's right. The flight attendant here chose to address it, so the author should comply.\n\nThe main issue is the author walking away when being lectured. Flight attendants are in a position of authority, especially regarding safety and rules. Disrespecting their instructions, even if the author feels it's unfair, could be seen as undermining their authority. Walking away and ignoring them might be considered rude or insubordinate, which could be in the author's wrong.\n\nBut also, the flight attendant's approach might have been harsh. The author had a long day and the attendant was already acting stringent. However, that doesn't justify walking away. The appropriate response might have been to listen, apologize if in the wrong, or calmly explain if there was confusion.\n\nSo, considering airline rules, the authority of the flight attendant, and the act of walking away, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
