I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class. The person uses the first class bathroom when the line for the regular one is long. The flight attendant then gets upset and lectures them, and the person walks away and ignores further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The person mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without any issues. That makes me think that maybe it's allowed, especially if they're in a seat close to first class. But maybe there's some unspoken rule or policy about not using the first class facilities if you're not a first class passenger. Airlines usually have certain rules about this, but if there's no clear policy against it, then the person isn't necessarily breaking a rule.\n\nThe flight attendant's reaction seems a bit harsh. She was already acting strict with other passengers earlier, so maybe she's having a bad day. The person in question didn't do anything different from previous times, and now they're being lectured. The person had a reason to use the bathroom quickly, especially if the line was long and the flight was ending. \n\nWhen the flight attendant started lecturing them, they interrupted with a sarcastic thank you and walked away. The FA then followed them and called them rude. The person's defense is that they were tired from a long day and didn't want to engage. But walking away when someone is talking to you, even if you disagree, can be seen as rude. However, if the person felt that the lecture was unnecessary or excessive, maybe their reaction is understandable.\n\nThe key points here are airline policies. If using the first class bathroom is allowed for economy passengers, especially those in seats near first class, then the person isn't in the wrong. If it's against the rules, then they might be. Since the person mentions they've done it before without issues, it's likely allowed. The flight attendant's strictness might be due to personal judgment rather than a clear policy. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting and walking away isn't the best approach, but the person might have felt justified if they didn't break any rules. The FA's public reprimand could have been unprofessional. \n\nSo, considering both the airline's policies and social interactions, the person might not be in the wrong. The main issue is whether using the first class bathroom was actually against the rules. Since there's no clear indication of that, and the person had prior experience without issues, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
