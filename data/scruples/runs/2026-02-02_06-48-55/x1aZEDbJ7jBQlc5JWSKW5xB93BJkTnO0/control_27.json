I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them certain perks like choosing seats. They were in the row behind first class. The flight attendant had been acting strict and made an announcement before landing about using the bathroom or stowing carry-ons now. There was a long line for the regular bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty. The author used the first class bathroom, which is allowed since they're in the adjacent row. \n\nThen, the flight attendant waited outside the bathroom door and lectured them. The author interrupted to say thanks and walked away, ignoring the FA's comment about rudeness. The key points here are whether using the bathroom was against the rules and if walking away was rude.\n\nNow, considering airline policies, typically, if you're seated near first class, you might be allowed to use their facilities, especially if it's unoccupied. The author has done this before without issues. So maybe the FA was overstepping. However, flight attendants have to enforce rules for safety and order. If the author wasn't supposed to use first class amenities, then they might be in the wrong. But if it's allowed, the FA's reaction is the problem.\n\nThe main conflict here is the FA's aggressive response. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary and chose to walk away. In a confined space like an airplane, flight attendants need to maintain authority. Disrespecting them could be seen as problematic. However, the FA's tone and approach might have been unprofessional, leading the author to react defensively.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If using the bathroom was allowed, then the author had a right to do so. Walking away from a lecture might be rude, but if the lecture was harsh and unnecessary, the author's response is understandable. However, ignoring the FA's authority could be seen as disrespectful. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nOn one hand, maintaining respect for staff is important. On the other, the FA's behavior might have been excessive. The author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer probably depends on the airline's specific policies. Since the user mentions the airline isn't known for friendly service, maybe the FA's behavior is typical. But the author's action of walking away could still be considered rude regardless. Hmm.\n"
