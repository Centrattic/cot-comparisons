I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away from a lecture by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is in an economy seat right behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. There was a line in the back, but the first class bathroom was empty. They used it, and then the FA confronted them. The author walked away and later ignored the FA's comment about being rude.\n\nSo, the key points here. Are there rules against using the first class bathroom if you're not in first class? The author mentions they've done this before without issue. But maybe the airline has specific policies. If that's the case, using the wrong bathroom could be a policy violation. However, the author isn't in first class, so maybe it's allowed. Some airlines let premium passengers use first class amenities, but the author has premier status, which might include that. But the FA could be enforcing a rule that others aren't aware of.\n\nNext, when confronted, the author walked away from the lecture. The FA followed and called them rude. Is walking away considered disrespectful? In a public setting like an airplane, flight attendants have authority to enforce rules. If the FA is doing their job, walking away might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary, but the FA's job is to ensure compliance with safety and policies. The author's interruption with \"thank you for telling me\" was polite, but then walking away might negate that.\n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't do anything to make the FA's job harder. However, the FA's job includes enforcing rules, and if the author is in violation, the FA needs to address it. The author's response might be seen as disregarding the FA's authority. On the other hand, if the policy isn't clearly communicated, the author might not be at fault. But the FA made an announcement about using the bathroom, which could imply that the first class bathroom is not available for economy class. However, the author might have used it before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone when they're talking to you is generally considered rude. The FA was trying to explain the policy, and the author left, which could be seen as rude. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, the way they responded might be at fault here. The FA followed them and loudly commented on their rudeness, which escalates the situation, but the author's initial walk away might have triggered that response.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives: the author might have unknowingly broken a policy, but if the policy isn't consistently enforced, they might not be at fault. However, the response to the FA's lecture by walking away is likely the main issue here. The author's action of walking away and ignoring the FA's comment could be seen as disrespectful, making them at least partially at fault. On the other hand, if the FA's approach was overly aggressive, the author might have a valid point. But in the context of a professional setting, the FA is in a position of authority, and the appropriate response would be to listen to the explanation, even if one disagrees. Therefore, the author's action of walking away and ignoring the FA could be considered rude, making them partially at fault.\n"
