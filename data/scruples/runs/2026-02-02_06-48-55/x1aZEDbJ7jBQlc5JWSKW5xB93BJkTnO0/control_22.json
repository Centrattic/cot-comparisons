I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away from a lecture by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the user is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them certain privileges like choosing seats near first class. The flight attendant in question was already being strict with passengers. Before landing, the FA made an announcement urging people to stow luggage or use the bathroom, which led to a rush. The user noticed the first class bathroom was empty, so they used it. Upon exiting, the FA confronted them, and the user walked away, leading to the FA following and reprimanding them for being rude.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the user do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? The user mentions they've used it before without issues. However, flight attendants typically have rules about who can use first class amenities. Even if the user is close to first class, using their facilities might be against airline policies. So maybe the user violated a rule, which the FA was pointing out.\n\nBut the FA's response seems excessive. The user was trying to avoid a long line, and the FA was already being strict. The user's decision to walk away might be seen as a way to avoid an unpleasant interaction, especially after a long day. However, cutting someone off and walking away can be considered rude, regardless of the situation. The FA then followed up by reprimanding the user in front of others, which escalated the situation.\n\nSo, was the user in the wrong? If using the first class bathroom without permission was a violation, then yes, they did something wrong. But if the airline allows premier status holders to use first class amenities, then maybe not. The user's action of walking away after an interruption could be seen as rude, but the FA's reaction was also harsh. The user might not be entirely at fault if the policy wasn't clear or if the FA was being overly strict. However, the act of walking away during a confrontation is generally considered impolite, so the user shares some responsibility.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the user actually broke a rule. If they did, then they're at least partially wrong. If not, then the FA was in the wrong for being harsh. But since the user acknowledges that FAs have hard jobs and there are regulations, maybe they should have checked the policy. However, if they've done it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced. It's a bit of a gray area. However, interrupting and walking away is rude, so the user did something wrong in that aspect.\n"
