I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom. The story is about the author using the first class bathroom when there was a long line in economy, and then getting lectured by the flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. But maybe there's an official policy that passengers should only use their assigned class's facilities. If so, the user might be in the wrong for using the wrong bathroom. However, the flight attendant didn't stop them before, which complicates things. The user might not have known the rule, or maybe it's not strictly enforced.\n\nNext, the interaction itself. The flight attendant waited by the door, which the user says was to confront them. The user interrupted the lecture by saying \"thank you for telling me\" and walked away. The flight attendant then followed and called the user rude. The user argues that the lecture was unnecessary and they were tired after a long day. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away mid-conversation is generally considered rude. Even if the user felt the lecture was unwarranted, interrupting and leaving could be seen as disrespectful. The flight attendant was doing their job, so the user might have a responsibility to listen, even if they disagree. However, the flight attendant's approach might have been aggressive or unprofessional, especially if they followed and raised their voice.\n\nThe user's frequent flying and premier status might mean they have some familiarity with the airline's practices. If they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, maybe the flight attendant was being overly strict. But if there's a policy against it, the user is in the wrong for following it now. \n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant's actions\u2014following the user to their seat and speaking loudly\u2014could be unprofessional. Maybe the user could have handled the situation better, but the FA's response might have been escalated unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering all angles: if the user violated a policy, they're wrong for not following it. If the FA overstepped, the user's reaction might be justified. The answer hinges on whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules and how the FA handled it. The user might be in the wrong for using the wrong bathroom, but the FA's behavior could also be at fault. However, the user's interruption and walking away is a breach of politeness regardless. So maybe the answer is A (user is wrong) because they violated a policy and interrupted the FA, but the FA could have handled it better. But if there's no clear policy, maybe B (not wrong). The user mentions that FAs have hard jobs, but the FA's response seems harsh. Still, walking away is generally rude. I think the answer is A.\n"
