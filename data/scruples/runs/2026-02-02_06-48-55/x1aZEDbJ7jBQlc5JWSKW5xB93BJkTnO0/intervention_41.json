I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom despite not being a first class passenger, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. However, that doesn't mean it's allowed. Airlines usually have specific rules about access to certain areas, even for frequent flyers. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules, so her reaction might be about maintaining policy.\n\nThe author then interrupts the flight attendant's lecture by saying \"thank you for telling me\" and walks away. This seems dismissive. The flight attendant followed and called them rude, escalating the situation. The author's choice to walk away while being lectured could be seen as disrespectful, even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary. \n\nThe author is in a high-status position with premier status, but that doesn't grant special privileges beyond seat selection. The flight attendant's job is to ensure compliance with safety and service protocols. The author's actions might have disrupted the crew's procedures, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant's behavior was aggressive, making announcements outside the norm and creating a rush. The author might have felt justified in using the nearest available bathroom. However, the way they handled the situation\u2014walking away and ignoring the FA\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, interrupting and walking away is generally rude. The author's stress from a long day is understandable, but it's important to address such situations with respect to avoid conflict, especially in a public setting with many passengers present.\n\nSo, while the flight attendant's behavior was harsh, the author's response was also inappropriate. The correct action would have been to acknowledge the mistake politely and perhaps ask if there was a specific reason for the rule. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for their response, even if the initial situation was tense.\n"
