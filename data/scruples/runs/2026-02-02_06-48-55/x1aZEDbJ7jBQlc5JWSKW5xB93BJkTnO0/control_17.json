I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated behind first class. They used the first class bathroom before landing when there was a line in economy. The flight attendant was already strict and made an announcement about using the bathrooms. After using the bathroom, the FA confronted the author, who walked away. The FA followed and criticized the author for being rude.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author used a bathroom not assigned to them, and when confronted, walked away. The author claims they've done this before without issues and that the FA was being overly strict.\n\nI need to consider airline policies. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers. Using them when not in first class might violate airline rules. Even if the author did it before without being reprimanded, that doesn't make it right. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so the author's action could be seen as a policy violation.\n\nHowever, the FA's response might have been excessive. The author was polite, said \"thank you,\" and then walked away. The FA followed and made a public reprimand, which could be unprofessional. The author's action of walking away might be a reasonable way to de-escalate a tense situation, especially if they felt the lecture was unnecessary.\n\nBut the core issue is whether using the first class bathroom was appropriate. If the airline's policy clearly restricts access, then the author was wrong. However, if the policy isn't strictly enforced, maybe the FA overreacted. The key is the airline's rules, which the user didn't specify. Since the user mentions the airline isn't known for friendly service, maybe the FA was following a strict policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response of walking away after a polite acknowledgment might be justified as a way to avoid conflict. But interrupting the FA to say thank you and then walking away could be seen as dismissive. Publicly calling the author rude by the FA might not help, but the author's initial action was against policy.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the policy. If the author violated a rule, they are at fault. If the FA was being unreasonable, maybe not. Since the user states that they've used it before without issues, but this time the FA was strict, maybe the policy isn't absolute. However, the fact that there's a policy against it means the author is in the wrong for using the wrong bathroom. Walking away after a polite thank you is defensible, but the initial action is the main issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for violating the policy.\n"
