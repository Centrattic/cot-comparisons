I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first class bathroom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're a frequent flyer with premier status, which usually comes with perks. They sat in the row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line in the back but no line in first class. So, the author used the first class bathroom, which is only three rows ahead. \n\nWhen exiting, the flight attendant confronts them. The author interrupts to say \"thank you\" and walks away. The flight attendant follows and calls them rude. The author then ignores her. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? The flight attendant's reaction seems to be about protocol. Airlines probably have rules about who can use which facilities. Even if the author has done this before without issues, this time the flight attendant noticed. The author might have violated a policy, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut the main question is whether walking away was wrong. The author was tired and in a long day. They had the right to not engage if they felt it was unnecessary. However, dismissing the flight attendant's instructions could be seen as disrespectful. Flight attendants have safety responsibilities, and ignoring them might set a bad precedent. \n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant's reaction seems excessive. If no one else was using the first class bathroom and it wasn't causing a problem, the lecture might be unwarranted. The author's action of walking away could be a valid response to being lectured for a minor infraction. \n\nBut in professional settings, especially with authority figures like flight attendants, there's an expectation of civility. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and walking away might be seen as rude. The flight attendant's job includes enforcing rules, and the author's dismissal could be considered disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the flight attendant's response was also harsh, calling the author out in front of others. The author's actions were a reaction to what they perceived as an unfair situation. So, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author didn't follow the rules by using the first class bathroom, leading to the confrontation. However, the flight attendant's handling of it was also questionable. \n\nAlternatively, if the rules weren't clear or weren't consistently enforced before, the fault isn't entirely on the author. But in the scenario, the author did use the wrong bathroom, which is a violation regardless of prior instances. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake was using the first class bathroom against the rules. The walking away part could be seen as rude, but maybe the primary issue is the initial action. However, the question is about walking away. The author interrupted and walked away, which is impolite regardless. Therefore, the answer might be A. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking specifically about walking away. The initial bathroom use is part of the context. So, if the author was already in violation, then the flight attendant's lecture is about correcting that. The author's response of walking away is disrespectful. Hence, the author is in the wrong for that action. Therefore, answer A.\n"
