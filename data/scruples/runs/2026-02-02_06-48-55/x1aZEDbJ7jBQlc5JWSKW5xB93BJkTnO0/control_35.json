I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) got upset and lectured them, and the author walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules about bathroom usage on planes. Usually, I think passengers are supposed to use the bathroom assigned to their class unless they're upgraded. If the author isn't in first class, maybe they aren't allowed to use that bathroom. But wait, the author mentioned they've used the front bathroom before without any issues. That might mean that sometimes it's allowed, especially if it's close and there's a line in their class.\n\nThe flight attendant's job is to enforce rules for safety and order. If there's a rule against using first class bathrooms for non-first class passengers, the FA is just doing their job by pointing it out. However, maybe the rule isn't that strict. Some airlines allow it if it's convenient, especially if the person is a frequent flyer or in a high status tier. The author has premier status, which might be a factor.\n\nNow, the FA's reaction: she waited by the bathroom, then followed the author and criticized them for walking away. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary and interrupted her. The FA's tone was angry, which might have escalated things. But the author walked away, which is considered rude in many situations. When someone is trying to communicate, walking off can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nBut then again, if the FA was being overly harsh or nitpicking, the author might have a valid reason to disengage. The author mentions the FA was already acting strangely, being strict with other passengers, and making extra announcements. This context suggests the FA had a bad day or was especially strict. However, the author's actions still need to be evaluated.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author break a rule? If yes, they might be at fault. If not, then maybe the FA overstepped. Also, the author's response\u2014walking away when lectured\u2014could be considered rude regardless, even if the initial issue was minor.\n\nI think there's a mix here. The author might have used the bathroom incorrectly, but the FA's handling was poor. However, walking away and ignoring the FA could be considered the author's fault because they chose to be disrespectful. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't engage politely, even if the FA was acting up.\n"
