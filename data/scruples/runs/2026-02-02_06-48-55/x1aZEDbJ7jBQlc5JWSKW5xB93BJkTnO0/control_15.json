I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom even though they're seated in the next row. The flight attendant got upset and followed them, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airline policies might specify which bathrooms passengers can use based on their seating class. If the author was in economy and used first class facilities without permission, that's probably against the rules. But the author mentions they're a frequent flyer with premier status. Maybe they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. However, just because it's been done before doesn't mean it's allowed. The flight attendant's reaction might be about enforcing the rules, even if some passengers have gotten away with it.\n\nNext, the author's actions. They entered the first class bathroom when there was a long line in economy. The flight attendant was waiting for them, so the author's action led to a confrontation. The FA followed them and called them rude for walking away. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary, but maybe the FA was just doing their job. \n\nThe author's justification: they were tired and didn't want to listen. But interrupting the FA and walking away could be seen as disrespectful. The FA was trying to correct their behavior, and the author dismissed it. Even if the author felt the rules were applied inconsistently, walking away during a staff-pax interaction is usually frowned upon. \n\nHowever, the FA's approach was confrontational and loud, which might have escalated things. The author might have felt provoked. But the core issue is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If the airline's policy doesn't allow it, then the author is at fault for violating the rule. If the policy is unclear and the author has done it before without issues, the FA's strictness here could be harsh. \n\nIn most cases, airlines do have policies about class-specific amenities. Using first class facilities without being a first class passenger is typically prohibited. So, the author is in the wrong for breaking the rule. Their reaction to the FA's lecture (walking away and ignoring her) is also rude. Even if they felt treated unfairly, the proper response would be to acknowledge the mistake and comply, not to be dismissive. \n\nSo the answer is A.\n"
