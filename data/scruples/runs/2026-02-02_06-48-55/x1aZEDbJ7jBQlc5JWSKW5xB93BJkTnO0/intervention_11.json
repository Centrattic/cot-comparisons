I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by using the first class bathroom and then walking away when reprimanded.\n\nFirst, the context: the person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting behind first class. They used the first class bathroom before landing because there was a long line in the back. The flight attendant was already acting strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom now. The author went to the first class bathroom, which was three rows ahead, and when confronted, walked away, ignoring the FA's lecture.\n\nNow, the key points. The main issue is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. The author mentions they've done this before without issues, but maybe the rules have changed or the airline has specific regulations. However, the user is asking if the author is at fault. \n\nThe FA's reaction was to lecture them, but the author walked away and ignored further comments. The author's main defense is that they didn't mean to make the FA's job harder and that the lecture was unnecessary. However, from an airline's perspective, there are likely policies about bathroom usage. First class bathrooms might be for first class passengers only. Even if the author has done it before, if it's against policy, they could be in the wrong. But if it's allowed, then maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the FA followed the author and criticized them in public. That could be unprofessional. However, the author's action of walking away after being confronted is the main point here. Even if they were right about using the bathroom, walking away when someone is speaking to them (especially an employee doing their job) is considered rude. The FA might have been upset, but the author's response was to ignore her, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the user says they felt the lecture was unnecessary and had a long day, but that doesn't justify walking away. The author's action of cutting the FA off and leaving could be seen as dismissive. Even if the FA was being overly strict, the appropriate response might have been to listen calmly or ask for clarification, not to walk away.\n\nSo, considering both sides: if using the first class bathroom was against the rules, the author is at fault. If it's allowed, then the FA was being unreasonable. But regardless of that, walking away when someone is addressing them, especially in a professional context, is generally considered rude. Therefore, the author's action of walking away and ignoring the FA is where the fault lies.\n"
