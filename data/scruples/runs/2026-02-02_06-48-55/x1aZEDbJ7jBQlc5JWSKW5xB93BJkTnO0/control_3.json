I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting in a seat right behind first class. The flight attendant was acting strange, strict with rules, and made an unusual announcement about stowing bags and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the economy bathroom, but the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. The author used that bathroom, and when exiting, the FA was there and lectured them. The author interrupted to say thanks and walked away. The FA followed, called them rude, and the author ignored her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. The author mentions they've done it before without issues. But maybe there are rules against non-first class passengers using that bathroom? If that's the case, the author is in the wrong for violating the rules. However, if the airline allows it, especially when the economy bathroom is busy, then maybe not. The FA's reaction seems harsh, but the author's actions of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as rude.\n\nThe author's justification is that they were tired after a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture. But interrupting and walking away might not be appropriate, regardless of the FA's tone. Also, the FA followed them and spoke loudly, which could escalate the situation.\n\nBut maybe the FA overstepped by following and making a scene. The key is whether using the bathroom was a rule violation. If not, the FA's response was unprofessional. If it was against the rules, the author broke them. The author might have a point if the rules aren't clear or if the FA is being overly strict. But without knowing the specific airline policies, it's hard. However, since the author has done it before without issues, maybe the FA was being picky. Still, the author's response of walking away and ignoring could be seen as disrespectful. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not staying to resolve the issue politely, but the FA's approach was also problematic. The answer might depend on the rules, but since the user is asking for a binary choice, the best answer is B (No) because the author might not be in the wrong if the rules allow it, and the FA's behavior was unprofessional. Alternatively, if using the first class bathroom is against the rules, then A (Yes). But since the author has done it before without problems, the rules might not be strictly enforced, so the FA was being inconsistent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
