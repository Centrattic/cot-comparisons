I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used the first class bathroom when they were seated behind it. The flight attendant then lectured them, the author walked away, and the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The user mentions that the airline isn't known for friendly service. If the airline has rules about which bathrooms passengers can use based on their seating area, then using the first class bathroom without being in first class might be against the policy. However, the author says they've done this before without issue. Maybe the rules vary by airline or flight. \n\nNext, the FA's behavior. She made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, which led to a line. The author chose to use the first class bathroom, which was empty. The FA then confronts them, leading to the author walking away. The FA followed and continued the reprimand. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author violate a rule? The FA's reaction could be due to protocol, but the author didn't know if they were breaking a rule. The author's action of walking away when being lectured could be seen as rude. The FA was doing her job, and interrupting her could be disrespectful. Also, the author has premier status, which might give them some flexibility, but maybe not the right to ignore staff instructions. \n\nThe FA's yelling and lecturing might be unprofessional, but the author's response of walking away and ignoring her could also be unprofessional. The author might have felt the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, but cutting off communication isn't the best approach. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not following the rules if there was a policy against using the first class bathroom unless upgraded. However, if there's no such policy, then the FA was being unreasonable. But since the author had premier status, maybe they're allowed to use first class amenities. The situation is a bit ambiguous. \n\nBut the main issue is the author walking away when being lectured. Even if the FA was being harsh, the author's reaction was to ignore her, which is disrespectful. So the author is partially at fault for not engaging respectfully, even if they felt the FA was wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). However, if the airline's rules permitted the author's action, then the FA was in the wrong. But since the author didn't know the rules clearly, maybe they're not entirely at fault. Hmm. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of walking away from a staff member who's trying to communicate a rule is generally considered rude and disrespectful. Even if the rule is unclear or the FA is being overly strict, the author's response was inappropriate. So I think the answer is A.\n"
