I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind it. The flight attendant got upset and the author walked away, then the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines usually have specific policies about which bathrooms passengers can use. If the author is in an economy seat, they might not be allowed to use the first class bathroom. But the author mentions they have premier status and sometimes get upgraded. However, in this case, they were in the row behind first class but not upgraded. So maybe using the first class bathroom was against the rules.\n\nBut the author says they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That complicates things. Maybe the rules aren't strictly enforced consistently. However, just because it's been done before doesn't mean it's allowed. The flight attendant's job is to enforce the rules, even if others have bent them before.\n\nThe author's actions: using the first class bathroom when not in first class. That's a breach of policy. The FA's reaction was to reprimand them. The author interrupted the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. Then, when the FA followed, the author ignored her. Walking away while being lectured could be seen as disrespectful, even if the FA's tone was harsh. \n\nThe FA's job is to enforce safety and rules. The author's behavior might have been disrespectful, even if they were stressed. The key points are whether using the bathroom was a rule violation and whether walking away was rude. \n\nIf the airline's policy prohibits non-first class passengers from using that bathroom, then the author is partly at fault. But the FA's tone and the situation (long line in economy) might have contributed to the tension. However, the author's choice to use the first class bathroom without permission is the main issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They violated a rule (if the policy exists) and disrespected the FA by walking away. Therefore, answer A (Yes) seems correct. But maybe the rules aren't clear. However, the author admits they've used it before, implying they knew. So, A.\n"
