I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story was in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without being in first class, and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Typically, first class amenities are exclusive to first class passengers unless they're upgraded. If the person isn't in first class, using that bathroom might be against the rules. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these policies, so the person might be at fault for violating them. However, the story mentions that the person has done this before without issue. That's a point to consider\u2014maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced, or maybe there's some leeway. But even if others have done it without being reprimanded, the flight attendant might still be within their rights to correct them.\n\nNext, the interaction itself. The person was interrupted by the flight attendant's lecture and chose to walk away. The flight attendant followed and accused them of being rude. The person's response of \"thank you for telling me\" and then leaving could be seen as dismissive. Even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, cutting off the conversation and ignoring the flight attendant might be considered disrespectful. Flight attendants are in a position of authority during the flight, so walking away could be seen as insubordinate.\n\nHowever, the flight attendant's approach might have been harsh. The person mentions the FA was acting strangely, reprimanding others for minor things. Maybe the FA was overstepping, and the person's reaction was a response to that. But regardless of the FA's demeanor, the person still needs to comply with the rules and engage respectfully, even if they disagree.\n\nThe key points are: using the wrong bathroom per the policy, and how they reacted to the correction. If the policy is clear that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the person is in the wrong for using it. If the flight attendant was doing their job to enforce the rules, the person's refusal to engage properly could be rude. However, if the policy isn't clearly communicated and there's a history of similar behavior without issues, it might be a gray area. But generally, the person should follow the rules and respond appropriately to authority figures, even if frustrated.\n"
