I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (OP) is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The OP is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated just behind first class. During the flight, the flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom or stowing bags before landing. There was a long line for the economy bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty. The OP used the first class bathroom, which is allowed for premier members, I think. Then, the FA confronted them, the OP interrupted her to thank her and walked away, leading to the FA following and calling them rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the OP do anything wrong by using the first class bathroom? And was walking away from the FA inappropriate?\n\nFirst, regarding bathroom access. The OP mentions they have premier status, and usually get seats near first class. The question is whether premier members are allowed to use the first class bathroom. I know some airlines allow elite members to use first class amenities even if they're not seated there. So maybe the OP was within their rights. However, the FA is saying they used the \"wrong\" bathroom. Maybe there's a policy against it, even for premier members? Or maybe the FA was strict, but the policy isn't clear. The OP says they've done this before without issue, so maybe the FA was being inconsistent or overly strict.\n\nThen, the confrontation. The FA approached the OP after the bathroom use. The OP interrupted her to say \"thank you for telling me\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The OP felt that the FA was being overly aggressive and that the lecture was unnecessary.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? Well, if using the first class bathroom was against the airline's rules, even as a premier member, then the OP made a mistake. But if it's allowed, then the FA was wrong to confront them. However, even if it's allowed, maybe the FA had a reason to remind them, but the OP didn't want to engage, leading to the walk away.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away during a conversation is generally considered rude. The OP's response was to interrupt and walk off, which might be seen as dismissive. Even if they're stressed from work, interrupting and leaving could be seen as disrespectful. The FA's response, following and speaking loudly, was also unprofessional, but that's her reaction.\n\nSo, the author might be at fault for walking away and being dismissive. However, if the FA was wrong to confront them about the bathroom use (if allowed), then the FA is at fault. But the question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the rules. If the author was allowed to use the first class bathroom, then the FA's actions were wrong, but the author's walk away was rude. If the author was not allowed, then both are wrong. But since the author mentions they've done it before without issues, maybe the airline allows it. So, the FA was being inconsistent. Still, the author's response was rude.\n\nSo the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because walking away and interrupting is rude, even if the FA was being strict. The author could have listened politely or explained their premier status, but instead chose to be dismissive.\n"
