I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have premier status but were in an economy seat behind first class. They used the first class bathroom when the economy line was long. The flight attendant waited for them outside the bathroom and then lectured them. The author walked away, then the FA followed, called them rude, and the author ignored her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. **Using the first class bathroom**: Airlines usually have specific rules about bathroom access. First class bathrooms are typically for first class passengers and their guests. The author, being in economy, might be violating a policy by using that bathroom. Even if others have done it before without issue, it's still against the rules. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these policies, so her reaction is about maintaining order and safety.\n\n2. **Interrupting the FA**: The author cut her off with \"thank you for telling me\" and walked away. That's disrespectful. Flight attendants are in charge of safety and ensuring compliance. Dismissing their instructions during a flight, even if the rules are strict, shows a lack of respect for their authority.\n\n3. **Ignoring the FA's follow-up**: When the FA followed and criticized the author, ignoring her could be seen as defiant. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, responding with silence might escalate the situation. A better approach might be to apologize, ask for clarification, or at least acknowledge her without confrontation.\n\nThe author argues that the FA was being overly strict and that they've done this before without issues. However, consistency in past enforcement doesn't make the action right if it's against the rules. Also, the FA's behavior might be stress-induced from a tough day, but that doesn't justify the author's response.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette and airline regulations, the author violated a rule (using the wrong bathroom), and then escalated the situation by walking away and ignoring the FA. The FA's actions, while maybe harsh, are within her role to enforce policies. The author's primary mistake was not following the rules and responding in a way that disrespected the FA's authority.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and for the way they responded to the flight attendant's instructions.\n"
