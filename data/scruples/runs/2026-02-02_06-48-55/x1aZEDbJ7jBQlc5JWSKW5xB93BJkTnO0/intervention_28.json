I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in economy class, right? The person has premier status and often flies with this airline. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, and there was a long line for the economy bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty. The person used the first class bathroom, then when confronted by the flight attendant, walked away and later ignored her when she followed.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the rules. Are there rules about using first class bathrooms for economy passengers? The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe it's allowed? But maybe there's a policy that says only first class passengers can use that bathroom. However, the author didn't know that? Or maybe they assumed it was okay because it was empty and the line was long. \n\nThe flight attendant's reaction was to lecture them, which the author found unnecessary. The author's response was to walk away and ignore further comments. The key points here are whether the author violated a rule and whether their response was appropriate. \n\nIf the airline's policy explicitly restricts first class bathrooms to first class passengers, then the author is in the wrong for breaking that rule. However, if the policy is more flexible, perhaps allowing access based on availability, then the author might not be in the wrong. The fact that previous FAs didn't reprimand them suggests that maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced every time, but this FA was being strict. \n\nThen there's the interaction. The FA followed the author to their seat and spoke loudly, which could be seen as unprofessional. But the author walked away and ignored the FA's comments about being rude. In a professional setting, even if you're upset, walking away and ignoring someone might be seen as rude. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the FA was doing their job. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the FA was acting strangely, being strict with rules. Maybe the FA was having a bad day, but the author still has to comply with their instructions. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, they didn't have to engage, but walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as an inconsiderate response. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for using the bathroom without checking the rules and for their response to the FA. Even if the policy isn't clear, the FA's job is to enforce it, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive and rude. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
