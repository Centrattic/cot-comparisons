I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom when told not to, and then walking away from the flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sits behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement before landing about using the bathroom now. There was a long line for the economy bathroom, but the first class one was empty. So the person used the first class bathroom. When exiting, the FA was there and reprimanded them. The author then walked away, leading to the FA calling them rude.\n\nNow, considering airline rules. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. Unless the flight is not full, maybe economy passengers can use them if space allows. But the author wasn't first class, just had premier status and a seat behind first class. So using the first class bathroom might be against policy. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so the author might have violated a policy.\n\nBut the author argues that they've done this before without issues. Maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced? However, just because it's not enforced every time doesn't mean it's allowed. The FA's role is to ensure compliance, so the author's action was technically wrong.\n\nThen there's the reaction. The author interrupted the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. That's disrespectful. The FA was doing her job, and walking away mid-conversation, especially when being corrected, isn't appropriate. Even if the author was stressed, the response was dismissive.\n\nThe FA followed and said it's rude to walk away. The author ignoring her is also rude. So both parties have some issues. The author broke a rule, but maybe the FA was overstepping if the rule isn't clear. However, the primary issue is the author's action of using the wrong bathroom and then not respecting the FA's instructions.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for both using the incorrect bathroom and walking away disrespectfully. The FA's harsh response might be part of the problem, but the main fault is the author's actions. So answer A.\n"
