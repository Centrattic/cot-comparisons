I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, the author mentions using the first class bathroom when there was a long line in the economy section. They say they've done this before without issues. But the flight attendant was upset and followed them to their seat, calling them rude. The author's response was to ignore her after a brief interruption.\n\nI need to consider airline policies. First class bathrooms are usually for first class passengers. Using them without permission might violate the rules, even if others do it. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules, so the author's action could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author interrupted the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. That's rude, regardless of the situation. Then, when the FA followed up, the author ignored her, which escalates the conflict. Even if the FA was strict, the author's response wasn't appropriate. \n\nHowever, the FA's behavior was also questionable\u2014yelling and following the passenger. But that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The key point is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it was, the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe the FA overreacted. But the author's response of walking away and ignoring was definitely rude. So the answer is A.\n"
