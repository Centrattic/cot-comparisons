I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when seated in economy, behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) reprimanded the author for that. The author walked away and ignored the FA's lecture, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline rules. Do economy passengers have access to first class bathrooms? I think most airlines allow that if the first class bathroom is available. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe there's no strict policy against it. But perhaps there's a rule, or the FA was strict about enforcing something. However, the user says the airline isn't known for friendly service, and the FA was already acting bizarrely, strict with rules. \n\nThe author had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture. They interrupted with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed and made a big deal about it in front of others. \n\nNow, the key points: Was using the first class bathroom against the rules? If it's allowed, then the FA was wrong to reprimand the author. If it's against the rules, then the author is at fault. The author's actions of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as rude, especially since the FA was doing their job. But if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, the author's reaction might be understandable. \n\nThe author's defense is that they've done it before without issues. Maybe this FA was being overly strict. However, the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the FA was wrong, the proper response might be to politely ask for clarification or accept the correction without defying the staff. \n\nIn terms of airline policies, if economy passengers can use first class bathrooms when available, the author isn't wrong. But if they shouldn't, then the author is. The answer might hinge on the specific airline's policy. Since the user doesn't mention the airline, but the author says they've used it before, perhaps it's allowed. However, the author might be overstepping by using a bathroom not assigned to their class, regardless of policy. \n\nAlso, the social etiquette aspect: walking away from someone when they're speaking to you is generally considered rude. So even if the author had a point, their reaction was rude. The FA's loud comment in public might have been inappropriate too. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for walking away and ignoring the FA, regardless of whether using the bathroom was allowed. Because even if the FA was wrong, the author's response was not appropriate. So answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
