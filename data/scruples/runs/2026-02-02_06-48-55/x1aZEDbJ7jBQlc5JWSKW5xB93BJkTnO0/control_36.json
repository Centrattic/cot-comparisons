I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. The user was in an economy seat but chose to use the first class bathroom. Even though they had premier status, that might not grant access to first class amenities. So, the user might have violated a policy there.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's reaction. They were strict, maybe even a bit over the top, but their job is to enforce rules. The user interrupted the attendant's lecture by saying thanks and walking away. That's considered rude in most social contexts, even if the user was stressed.\n\nThen there's the part where the FA followed them and spoke loudly about rudeness. The user ignored her, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the user feels they didn't do anything wrong, cutting someone off and leaving isn't polite.\n\nBut there's also the context: the flight attendant was acting unusually strict, maybe overcompensating. The user had a long day and was in a hurry. However, using the bathroom in another class without permission is still a policy violation. The user's actions might not be malicious, but they still broke a rule.\n\nSo, the user is partly in the wrong for using the first class bathroom. They also handled the confrontation poorly by walking away. The FA's response might have been excessive, but the user's reaction was also uncooperative. Since the question is whether the user is in the wrong, and considering the rules, the answer is A.\n"
