I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom despite being in economy class, then walking away when a flight attendant lectures them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions using the first class bathroom before, but maybe there are rules against that. If the flight attendant is enforcing policies, even if they seem strict, the passenger might be at fault for breaking them. Also, the flight attendant's job is to ensure safety and compliance, so their instructions should be followed.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The author interrupted the FA's lecture and walked away, which the FA found rude. The author's response was dismissive. Even if the FA was being strict, walking away and ignoring them could be seen as disrespectful. The FA followed them and made a public comment, which might be unprofessional, but the author's actions in ignoring and walking away could still be their fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because they broke a rule and disrespected the staff. But maybe the other way around\u2014maybe the FA was being unreasonable. However, the author's actions in ignoring and walking away are still rude regardless of the FA's tone. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
