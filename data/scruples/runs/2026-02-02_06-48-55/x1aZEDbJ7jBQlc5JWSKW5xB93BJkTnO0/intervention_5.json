I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them for using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author used the first class bathroom, which they were allowed because it's only three rows ahead. They had a long day and didn't want to wait in a longer line. The flight attendant got upset, the author walked away, and then ignored further comments.\n\nNow, the key points. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. The flight attendant was strict, maybe even overly so, but the author still used the first class bathroom. The FA then reprimanded them, and the author walked off.\n\nFrom a service perspective, flight attendants have rules to follow for safety and order. Even if the rules aren't strictly enforced every time, using the first class bathroom might still be against policy. The author's action could be seen as respectful but also possibly violating a rule.\n\nWhen the FA tried to address it, the author walked away and ignored her. The FA called them rude, which is a judgment call. The author's response of \"thank you for telling me\" and then walking away might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if they were tired.\n\nThe bigger question is whether the author's action of walking away was inconsiderate. The FA was doing their job, and the author's response could be seen as not respecting their authority. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and walking away isn't the best approach.\n\nBut also, the FA's behavior might have contributed\u2014being loud and following the author. The author might have felt targeted. However, the act of walking away when reprimanded could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's nuance. The author might have broken a rule, but the FA's response was harsh. However, the author's response of ignoring and walking away is more clearly inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because interrupting the FA and walking away is disrespectful, regardless of the initial situation.\n"
