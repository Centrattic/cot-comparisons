I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as a passenger in economy, which was allowed before, but then getting lectured by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions they have premier status and often sit near first class. If using the first class bathroom isn't explicitly prohibited for them, maybe it's allowed. However, the flight attendant is enforcing a rule, possibly because of a recent policy change or specific flight circumstances. The FA's strictness might be due to safety or protocol, like during landing when the lavatories need to be accessible for emergencies.\n\nThe author's action: using the bathroom and then walking away when confronted. The FA followed and called them rude. The key points here are whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules and whether walking away was disrespectful.\n\nEven if the author has done it before without issues, policies can change, or this FA might have a strict approach. The author's decision to leave mid-lecture could be seen as dismissive, regardless of the FA's tone. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the passenger's response might not consider their authority.\n\nBut the author also had a long day and the FA was already being overly strict. There might be a gray area. However, in professional settings, even if someone is being harsh, the appropriate response is to comply or ask questions, not to walk away. So the author's action of ignoring the FA after being reprimanded might be the wrong move here.\n\nSo I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded a rule (if it was in place) and walked away from a crew member who was doing their job, which is impolite and could disrupt the flight environment.\n"
