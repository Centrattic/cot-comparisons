I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom, and the person walking away. I need to figure out if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the airline's policies. The user mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. Maybe there's no strict rule against it, or maybe the policies vary by airline. However, the flight attendant is enforcing a rule now, which could mean that the airline has a specific policy in place for this flight or situation. Even if the user has done it before, if it's against the current rules, that's a point against them.\n\nNext, the context of the flight attendant's behavior. The user says the FA was \"bizarrely\" and \"super stringent\" with rules. The FA made an announcement about using the bathroom now, which might be related to safety or flight procedures. Using the first class bathroom might not be allowed during certain phases of the flight, like during landing preparations. If the user used it when they shouldn't have, even if they've done it before, they might be in the wrong.\n\nThen, the user's response. They interrupted the FA's lecture to say \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. Walking away during a conversation, especially when being reprimanded, could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the user was tired, interrupting and leaving without allowing the FA to finish might be inconsiderate.\n\nBut the user has a valid point about the long line and the available first class bathroom. If the airline allows such use under normal circumstances, maybe the FA is overstepping. However, the FA might have a reason for the sudden rule change, like safety or a specific protocol for landing. The user's prior experience doesn't necessarily override current instructions.\n\nThe user's intent wasn't malicious. They didn't mean to cause trouble, but they might have ignored a specific instruction. The FA's reaction was loud and public, which could be unprofessional. However, the user's action of walking away could be seen as dismissive regardless.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away when someone is speaking to you, especially in a professional context, is usually frowned upon. The user's response of \"thank you\" doesn't stop the FA from explaining, but the user left anyway. This might be the main issue here. Even if the user felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and leaving is rude.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they ignored a direct instruction from the flight attendant and walked away during a conversation, which is disrespectful. Even if the FA's approach was harsh, the user's response was also inappropriate. The answer should be A.\n"
