I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a flight attendant lecturing them for using the first class bathroom when they were seated in the row behind. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The person has premier status and sits near first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author went to the first class bathroom when there was a long line in the back. The FA confronted them, the author interrupted to say thanks and walked away, ignoring further lectures.\n\nThe main issue is whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. The user mentions that they've done it before without issues. The FA's reaction seems to be about enforcing rules, but maybe there's a policy against non-first class passengers using that bathroom. If there's a policy, then the author might be wrong for violating it. However, if the policy isn't consistently enforced, that's another angle.\n\nAlso, the author's response: interrupting the lecture and walking away. That's generally considered rude because you shouldn't walk away when someone is talking to you, especially in a professional setting. The FA followed and called them out for rudeness. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, ending the conversation respectfully would be better.\n\nBut maybe the flight attendant was being overly strict. The user mentions the FA was acting bizarrely before, being super stringent with rules. So there's a possible context of the FA being harsh. However, that doesn't excuse the author's rudeness.\n\nSo breaking it down: 1) Did the author violate a rule by using the first class bathroom? If yes, then they're in the wrong for breaking the rule. If not, then maybe the FA was being unfair. 2) The act of walking away and ignoring the lecture is generally rude regardless of the FA's tone. \n\nThe user says they've used the front bathroom before without being told off. That suggests maybe the rule isn't consistently applied. However, that doesn't mean the rule doesn't exist. The airline might have policies in place that passengers are supposed to follow, even if enforcement is inconsistent. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, interrupting and walking away is rude. The author could have politely asked why it's not allowed or acknowledged the FA's point without arguing. By cutting off the conversation, they showed disrespect. \n\nSo the author is partially at fault for both potentially breaking a rule and for their rude response. However, if there's no clear rule against using the first class bathroom, the FA might have overstepped. But given that the author's action led to a confrontation and rudeness, they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the rudeness, even if there's some ambiguity about the bathroom policy. The key point is how they handled the situation, not just the initial action. Walking away and ignoring someone speaking to you is a breach of etiquette regardless of the context.\n"
