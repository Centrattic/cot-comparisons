I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant being upset with them for using the first class bathroom when they're seated in economy, behind first class. The author walked away when the FA was lecturing them and later got called out for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines do have regulations about bathroom usage. First class bathrooms are typically reserved for first class passengers. Even if the author is in a seat near first class (like in a premium economy or a specific economy seat that's adjacent), using the first class bathroom might be against policy. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, but maybe that's a different scenario. Maybe they were upgraded or the situation was different before.\n\nThe FA's behavior: She was already being strict with other passengers, making extra announcements. This could indicate she was having a tough day or enforcing rules more strictly. When the author used the first class bathroom, the FA confronted them. The author, feeling that they were being lectured unnecessarily, walked away and ignored the FA's follow-up comments.\n\nThe author's perspective: They had a long day and didn't want to engage. They might feel the FA was being overly harsh. However, even if the author felt that way, interrupting the FA and walking away could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting where the FA is doing their job.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author break a rule? If the airline's policy prohibits economy passengers from using first class bathrooms, then yes. 2) Was walking away appropriate? Cutting off a service professional could be rude, regardless of the situation. Even if the FA was being a bit harsh, the proper response might be to acknowledge the mistake and comply, not to ignore or walk away.\n\nThe author could have apologized, explained they were in a hurry, or asked for clarification on the policy. Instead, they interrupted the FA and walked off, which might be seen as dismissive. The FA's job is to ensure compliance with safety and airline rules, so the author's actions could be seen as challenging her authority.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was in a seat that's adjacent to first class (like a premium seat) and the airline allows that bathroom usage, the FA's reaction might be unwarranted. But the story doesn't clarify if the author's seat actually permits that. The author mentions they have premier status but sit in the row behind first class unless upgraded. So unless their seat is in a specific area that allows access, using the first class bathroom is a violation.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away when someone is speaking to you is considered rude in many contexts. Even if the FA was being loud or abrupt, the author's response could have been more respectful. The FA's loud comment about being rude might have been to enforce her point, but the author's initial action of walking away was disrespectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: If the author violated a rule by using the first class bathroom, they are at fault for that. Additionally, their reaction of walking away and ignoring the FA is a breach of basic respect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
