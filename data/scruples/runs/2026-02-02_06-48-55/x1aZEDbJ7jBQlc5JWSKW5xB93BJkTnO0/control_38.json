I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person is in economy, behind first class. They used the first class bathroom when there was a long line in economy. The flight attendant (FA) was already acting strict, making unusual announcements. After the person uses the bathroom, the FA confronts them, the person interrupts to say thanks and walks away. The FA follows and calls it rude. \n\nSo, the key points here. Were there any rules against using the first class bathroom? The user mentions they've done it before without issues. But maybe there's a policy. Flight attendants are supposed to follow safety and service protocols. If there's a rule that economy passengers can't use first class bathrooms, then the user broke that. However, if the FA didn't enforce it before, maybe the user's action isn't wrong.\n\nThe user's reasoning: They needed to go bad, the line was long, and the first class bathroom was empty. The FA's behavior seemed inconsistent (other passengers were being strict about rules but the user was singled out). The user felt the lecture was unnecessary, especially after a long day. They interrupted the FA to say thanks and walked away. \n\nThe FA's perspective: She might be enforcing rules to maintain order. If the user is a frequent flyer, maybe they should be more aware of the rules. Also, walking away during a lecture could be seen as disrespectful, even if the user felt the lecture was unfair.\n\nThe user's actions: They didn't cause a safety issue, just used an available bathroom. But maybe they should have checked the policy. However, the inconsistency in enforcement (no prior issues) complicates that. Walking away might be rude, but if the user felt the lecture was unwarranted, they might have a point in wanting to end the interaction.\n\nSo, balancing both sides. The user might have broken a rule, but the FA's harsh reaction could be at fault too. The key is whether the user's action was against the airline's policy. If there's no clear rule, the FA might be overstepping. If there is a rule, the user is in the wrong for breaking it. But the user's response (walking away) could be seen as rude regardless. However, if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, the user's reaction is more understandable.\n\nThe user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, which suggests the FA might be being inconsistent. So the user isn't the only one at fault. The answer might hinge on whether the user violated a rule or if the FA was being too strict. If there's no rule, then the user isn't wrong. If there is, then the user is wrong for breaking it but maybe the FA overreacted. However, the user's interruption and walking away is impolite. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. If the action was against policy, then yes. If not, then no. Since the user says they've done it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't strict. So the FA is at fault for being inconsistent. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. But if the user is wrong for walking away regardless of the situation, then they are. But the FA was following them and making a scene. The user's action might be a reasonable way to end an uncomfortable interaction. So the answer could be B (No).\n"
