I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant lectured them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they usually get seats near first class. The flight attendant was being strict with passengers, making extra announcements. Before landing, the FA told everyone to stow bags or use the bathroom now, which caused a rush. The author noticed the first class bathroom had no line and used it. When exiting, the FA was there and scolded them. The author, who had a tough day, said \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude for walking away. The author is now asking if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the author violate any rules by using the first class bathroom? 2) Was it appropriate to walk away when being lectured?\n\nStarting with the first point. The author mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. So maybe the airline allows it under certain circumstances. But maybe there are specific policies. If the airline's policy is that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the author (who's in economy but near first class) might be violating that. However, the author's seat is directly behind first class, which might be part of an adjacent section, perhaps a premium economy or business class that does have access. The user isn't clear on the exact policy, but the fact that there's a first class bathroom and the author could access it without prior problems suggests that maybe in some cases it's allowed. However, if the flight attendant is now enforcing the rule strictly, maybe the author was in the wrong. But the author isn't a first class passenger, so perhaps they shouldn't use that bathroom. However, if the economy bathrooms were all occupied, and the first class one was free, maybe it's a reasonable choice, especially if the airline's policy isn't strictly enforced.\n\nBut the flight attendant's reaction is key. The author was scolded for using the wrong bathroom. If that's against the rules, then maybe they did something wrong. But the author mentions they've done this before without issues, so maybe the rules aren't consistent. However, the flight attendant's job is to enforce the rules, even if they haven't done it before. So if there's a rule against using first class bathrooms for non-first class passengers, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the rules are flexible, then maybe not.\n\nThe second point is about walking away when being lectured. Generally, it's considered rude to walk away from someone while they're talking, even if you're in disagreement. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary, but interrupting and walking away could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The FA was doing her job, and even if the author felt the scolding was harsh, walking away might have been an inconsiderate response. The FA followed the author and called them rude, which is a common social expectation. So in that aspect, the author might be in the wrong for walking away, regardless of the initial bathroom issue.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. If the initial action (using the bathroom) was a minor infraction (if it's against the rules) and the response (walking away) was rude, then the author might share some responsibility. However, if the flight attendant was being overly harsh and the author was just trying to avoid conflict, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. But socially, interrupting and walking away is generally not acceptable. \n\nSo considering all, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because using a restricted bathroom (if that's the case) and walking away when being reprimanded. However, if the bathroom use wasn't against the rules, then the flight attendant was being unreasonable. But since the FA is the enforcer of the rules, even if they didn't enforce it before, the author's action could still be against the policy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for both using the wrong bathroom and walking away."
