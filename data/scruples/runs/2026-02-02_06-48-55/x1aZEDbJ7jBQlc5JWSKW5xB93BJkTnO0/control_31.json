I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away from the flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting behind first class. During landing, they used the first class bathroom when there was a long line in the economy section. The flight attendant was upset and followed them to lecture, leading to the author walking away.\n\nSo, the key points here are about airline rules and etiquette. Airline policies usually dictate that only first class passengers can use the first class facilities. Even if the economy section is busy, using the first class bathroom without permission is against the rules. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these policies, so the author's action was a breach of protocol.\n\nThen, when confronted, the author walked away instead of engaging. The flight attendant followed and called them rude. The author's response was to ignore her. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Legally, using the first class bathroom without permission could be a policy violation. The flight attendant was doing her job by pointing this out. The author's decision to walk away and ignore the FA might be seen as disrespectful, even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary. While the FA's tone was harsh, the author's action of walking away is typically considered rude in social interactions, regardless of the situation. However, the FA was in the middle of a job, so the author's choice to disengage could be justified by some as self-preservation after a stressful day. But in terms of right and wrong, the initial act of using the wrong bathroom is the main issue here. The walk away might be seen as a lesser wrong compared to breaking the policy.\n"
