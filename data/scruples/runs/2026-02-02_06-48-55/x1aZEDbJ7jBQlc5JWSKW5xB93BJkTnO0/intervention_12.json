I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them a seat near first class. They were on a flight where the flight attendant was being strict. Before landing, the FA made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom now. There was a long line for the regular bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was three rows ahead. The author used that bathroom. When exiting, the FA was there and gave them a lecture about using the wrong bathroom. The author interrupted her with a thank you and walked away. The FA followed and called it rude, but the author ignored her. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Do they allow non-first class passengers to use the first class bathroom? The author mentions they've used it before without issues. But maybe there's a policy against it. If the author is in economy, using first class facilities might be against the rules, even if they've done it before. However, if the FA didn't stop them before, maybe there's inconsistency in enforcement.\n\nNext, the FA's behavior. She made an announcement, which might have been about preparing for landing, not just bathroom use. If using the first class bathroom is against policy, the FA is doing her job by correcting the author. But the author was in a long line, and the first class bathroom was empty. The author's rationale was practical\u2014avoiding the line. The FA's response was a lecture, which the author found unnecessary given their prior experience.\n\nThe author's actions: walking away while the FA was lecturing. The FA was doing her job, pointing out a policy violation. The author interrupted with a thank you and walked away. The FA followed and called it rude. The author then ignored her. \n\nIs walking away from a FA, even if they're being rude, appropriate? The FA is in a position of authority. Disrespectful behavior, like walking away mid-lecture, could be seen as undermining their role. Even if the author felt the FA was being unfair, the proper response might be to listen, acknowledge the issue, and then perhaps ask questions or clarify later. Ignoring the FA after being called out might be considered disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the FA was being overly strict and the lecture was unnecessary. They might feel that their actions were justified given the circumstances. Also, if the policy isn't clear or consistently enforced, the author could argue they weren't aware. But generally, airlines have strict policies about using first class amenities. Even if others have done it before, it doesn't make it right.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author violated a policy (thus being wrong), or if the FA overstepped (author not wrong). Given that the author is a frequent flyer, they might be more aware of such policies. If using the first class bathroom is restricted, then the author is in the wrong for using it. However, the FA's approach was confrontational, which could be excessive. But the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA is also unprofessional. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting and walking away from someone who is trying to address you is generally considered rude. The FA was doing her job, so the author's reaction could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author felt justified, the way they handled it might not be appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for both using the bathroom against policy and for the way they responded. However, if the policy was unclear or inconsistently enforced, there might be some nuance. But based on the information given, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
