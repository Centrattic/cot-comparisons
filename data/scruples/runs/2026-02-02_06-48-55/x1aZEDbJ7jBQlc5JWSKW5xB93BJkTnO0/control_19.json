I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in economy. \n\nFirst, the user mentions they frequently fly with this airline and have premier status, which probably gives them priority boarding and maybe some perks. But they aren't upgraded to first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, leading to a long line in economy. The first class bathroom was only three rows ahead, so the person used that one instead.\n\nThe flight attendant then confronted them, and the user walked away, leading to the FA following and calling them rude. The user is asking if they were wrong to walk away.\n\nI need to consider airline policies. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers unless there's an overflow. If there's a line in economy, using first class might not be allowed. However, the user says they've done it before without issues. Maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, but this time, the FA took issue with it.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The FA was already acting strict, maybe in a bad mood. The user felt the lecture was unnecessary and walked away. But interrupting the FA and walking off could be seen as rude, even if the user was stressed. The FA followed and raised her voice, which isn't great either.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the airline's policy prohibits using first class facilities unless you're a first class passenger, then the user broke the rule. The FA's reaction might be excessive, but the user's action might still be against the rules. However, if the policy isn't clear or previously enforced, maybe the FA overreacted. But walking away mid-conversation could be rude regardless.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they used a facility they weren't entitled to, even if others don't enforce it. The FA's behavior was unprofessional too, but the user's action was a rule violation. The interruption and walking away also show disrespect.\n"
