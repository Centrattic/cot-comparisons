I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe the rules aren't strictly enforced. However, if there's a policy against using first class facilities unless upgraded, the author might have violated that. But the user isn't certain, so maybe the policy isn't clear or is flexible.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. The FA was described as being strict, making extra announcements, and acting bizarrely. The author felt it was a long day and didn't want to engage. Walking away could be seen as disrespectful, but the FA's tone was angry. The author's response was to interrupt with a sarcastic \"thank you,\" then walk off. That seems dismissive.\n\nThe FA followed and called the author rude, which escalated the situation. The author's choice to ignore the FA afterward might be inconsiderate. Even if the FA was harsh, cutting someone off mid-conversation isn't polite. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and being disrespectful. \n\nThe author might have handled it better by calmly explaining they were in a hurry or apologizing if they did something wrong. Walking away and ignoring could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a confined space like an airplane where interactions need to be respectful.\n\nSo, while the FA's approach could be better, the author's reaction of walking away and ignoring might be in the wrong. The author could have de-escalated the situation more effectively. Answering A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate here.\n"
