I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The main issue is using the first class bathroom without being in first class and then walking away when reprimanded.\n\nFirst, were they allowed to use the first class bathroom? The user mentions they've done it before without issues. Maybe the airline allows that, but maybe there are specific rules now. The flight attendant's reaction suggests it's against the rules. However, if there's no line in first class and the person is in a premium seat (even if not first class), maybe it's a gray area. The user has premier status, so maybe they're entitled to some privileges.\n\nThen, when the flight attendant confronted them, the user walked away. Is that rude? The FA was doing their job, pointing out a policy violation. Interrupting with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walking off could be seen as dismissive. Even if the user was tired, responding politely might have been better. The FA followed and called them out for walking away, which is a valid point\u2014interacting respectfully is expected, even if you disagree.\n\nThe user also mentions the FA was being strict with others. Maybe the FA had a bad day, but that doesn't excuse the user's behavior. The key here is whether the user violated a rule. If the airline's policy forbids non-first class passengers from using that bathroom, then the user was wrong. However, if there's no such rule, maybe the FA overstepped. But the user admitted they used it before without being reprimanded. Maybe the policy is inconsistent, but the current FA is enforcing it.\n\nIn terms of the response, walking away after being confronted could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the user felt the lecture was unnecessary, walking out might escalate the situation. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so the user's reaction could be seen as uncooperative.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the user might have broken a rule (if there is one), and then responded in a way that was disrespectful. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
