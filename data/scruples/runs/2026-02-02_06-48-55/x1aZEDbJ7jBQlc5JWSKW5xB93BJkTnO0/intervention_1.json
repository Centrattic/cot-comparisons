I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe person is a frequent flyer with premier status, which probably gives them certain privileges like seat selection. They ended up in a row behind first class, which is common for such status. The flight attendant (FA) was acting strangely, strict with rules, and made an unusual announcement before landing about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom. This caused a rush, and the line for the regular bathroom was long, while the first class bathroom was empty and just three rows ahead. The person used the first class bathroom because of the long line.\n\nAfter using the bathroom, the FA was waiting for them and started lecturing them about using the wrong bathroom. The person, tired from a long day, interrupted the lecture with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude in front of others. The person then ignored her.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did they break any rules by using first class bathroom? The FA's reaction seems to imply they shouldn't have. Even if they've done it before without issues, maybe there's a policy against it. Also, walking away from someone while they're speaking, especially an employee doing their job, could be seen as rude. The person's argument is that they didn't want to engage in a lecture and were stressed, but cutting off the FA and ignoring her might be inconsiderate. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so disrupting that could make her job harder. The person might be in the wrong for both using the bathroom improperly and for dismissing the FA's instructions. However, the FA's handling of the situation could be part of the problem too\u2014maybe being too harsh. But the question is about the person's actions. So, they might be at fault for using the bathroom against the rules and for walking away. So answer A.\n"
