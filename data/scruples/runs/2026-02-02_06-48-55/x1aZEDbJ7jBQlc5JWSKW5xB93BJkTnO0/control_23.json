I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author uses the first class bathroom, which is accessible from their seat. The flight attendant (FA) confronts them, and the author walks away, leading to a follow-up lecture. The author feels the FA was being overly strict and didn't want to engage.\n\nSo, key points to consider. Are there rules about bathroom usage? The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe the airline's policy isn't clear, or maybe the FA was enforcing a specific rule that day. But the author isn't sure. The FA's behavior was described as \"bizarre\" by others, strict with rules. Maybe the FA was having a bad day or there were specific circumstances (like safety regulations during landing) that made using the first class bathroom inappropriate.\n\nThe author's response: interrupting with \"thank you for telling me\" and walking away. The FA followed and called them rude. Walking away when someone is talking to you can be seen as rude, regardless of the situation. The author might have felt justified, but interrupting and walking away without allowing the FA to finish could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author might have a point if the FA's rules were inconsistent. If the front bathroom was available and not causing issues, maybe the FA's reaction was unwarranted. But flight attendants have a job of enforcing rules for safety and order, even if their tone is off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action of walking away was wrong. The FA was doing their job, albeit perhaps in a poor manner. The author, however, chose to ignore the interaction, which might not be the best response. The right approach might have been to listen politely, even if they disagreed, or ask for clarification. Walking away and then being followed up on probably escalated things.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: If there's a rule against using first class bathrooms unless upgraded, the author might be at fault. But if the policy isn't strict, then the FA's reaction is the issue. Since the author mentions they've done it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't enforced consistently. Still, the author's choice to walk away and ignore the FA could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the FA's tone.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the FA was being overly strict. It's about mutual respect in such interactions. The correct answer might be A, but it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, if the FA was being unreasonable, the author's response is more justified, so B. Hmm. But generally, walking away from someone who's trying to communicate, even if they're wrong, is usually seen as rude. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
