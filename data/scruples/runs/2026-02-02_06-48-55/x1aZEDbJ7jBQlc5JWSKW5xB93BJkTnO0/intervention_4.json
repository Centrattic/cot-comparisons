I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe person is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them access to certain perks like seat selection. They were in a row right behind first class but not upgraded. The flight attendant (FA) made an unusual announcement before landing, urging people to stow luggage or use the bathroom now. This led to a rush, with lines forming in the regular bathrooms but not in first class. The person went to the first class bathroom, even though they weren't in first class. When they came out, the FA was there and lectured them. The person interrupted the lecture with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. Now the person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. Even if the person is in a row near first class, they might not have access unless the airline allows it. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so using the first class bathroom could be against the rules, especially if it's a policy that's not clearly communicated to the author. The FA's reaction might be due to her duty to maintain order and ensure rules are followed, which is part of her role.\n\nHowever, the person mentions they've used the front bathroom before without being reprimanded. If that's the case, maybe the FA's reaction was inconsistent or perhaps the situation this time was different. The person is in a high-traffic time (before landing), and the line was long. Maybe they felt justified in using the first class bathroom to avoid the line, especially since it was nearby. But still, if the policy is clear that only first class passengers can use it, then the person might be in the wrong for not following the rules.\n\nThe person's response to the FA's lecture was to interrupt and walk away. That's definitely rude, regardless of the situation. Even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, cutting her off and ignoring her is disrespectful. The FA was doing her job, and the person's reaction could escalate the situation unnecessarily. The FA's following them and calling them rude was a response to their behavior, which was indeed socially and professionally inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's approach could have been more diplomatic. Maybe she should have explained the policy calmly instead of lecturing. But the person's action of walking away was a breach of etiquette. So, while the person might have had a point about the rules being unclear or inconsistently enforced, their response was definitely wrong. They could have politely asked why they couldn't use the bathroom if they were unsure, instead of acting dismissively.\n\nIn summary, the person is in the wrong for two main reasons: using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger (assuming that's against the airline's policy) and walking away while being lectured, which is disrespectful. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the person's reaction made that harder. So the answer should be A.\n"
