I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) lectured them, and the author walked away, leading to more conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airline policies about bathroom usage can vary, but generally, economy class passengers aren't supposed to use first class bathrooms. However, the author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That's a point. Maybe the airline allows it as long as the first class isn't occupied, or maybe it's not strictly enforced.\n\nThen there's the context of the flight. The author has premier status and often sits near first class. The FA was acting unusually strict, making extra announcements. The line for the economy bathroom was long, and the first class bathroom was empty. So the author's action might be seen as reasonable to avoid holding up others.\n\nWhen the FA confronted them, the author interrupted and walked away. The FA followed and made a public comment. The author's defense is that they had a long day and didn't want to engage. \n\nOn the other hand, the FA's job is to enforce rules. If the author violated a rule, even if others didn't care, the FA has to address it. The author's interrupting and walking away could be seen as rude, especially since the FA was just doing their job. The author's action might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nBut then again, if the FA's lecture was unnecessary or harsh, the author's reaction is understandable. The FA's public reprimand might have been unprofessional.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They broke a rule, but if the rule wasn't enforced before, maybe they weren't aware. However, interrupting someone when they're speaking is generally considered rude. The author chose to walk away instead of addressing the issue calmly, which could be where they're at fault. The FA's response was also unprofessional, but that doesn't absolve the author of their actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for not following the rules consistently, even if others didn't enforce them before. But the FA's handling of the situation was poor. The answer might depend on whether the rule is clear and if the FA was justified in their reaction. Since the author admitted to using the wrong bathroom, even if it was because of the circumstances, they did break a rule. Their response (walking away) was rude. So answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
