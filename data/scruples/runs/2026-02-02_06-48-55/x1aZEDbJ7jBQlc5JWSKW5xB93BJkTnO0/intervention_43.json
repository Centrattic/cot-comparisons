I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first-class bathroom when they're seated in an economy row behind first class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. The user mentions they've used the first-class bathroom before without issues, but this time the FA was strict. Maybe there's a rule against using first-class facilities unless you're in first class. If that's the case, the author could be in the wrong for breaking the rule. However, the user also says the airline isn't known for friendly service, and this FA was acting unusually strict. \n\nBut the key point is whether using the first-class bathroom is against the rules. If the policy prohibits non-first-class passengers from using it, then the author did something wrong, and the FA was just enforcing the rule. The author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA might be rude, even if they feel they were treated unfairly. The FA's job is to enforce policies, so the author's reaction could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, if the policy isn't clearly communicated or if the FA is being overly strict, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the user says they have premier status and know the usual procedure. If using the first-class bathroom is allowed sometimes, but not this time, that's confusing. However, the user should follow the FA's instructions to avoid conflict. \n\nThe author interrupted the FA and walked away, which is impolite regardless. Even if they feel wronged, responding with rudeness isn't appropriate. The FA followed them and pointed out the rudeness, which the author could have addressed diplomatically instead of ignoring.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for both using the bathroom against policy (if it's prohibited) and for walking away and ignoring the FA. Therefore, answer A.\n"
