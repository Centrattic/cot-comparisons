I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, often getting seats behind first class. The flight attendant was being strict, announcing that people should stow carry-ons or use the bathroom before landing. The person used the first-class bathroom, which was three rows ahead, and when they came out, the FA was there and scolded them. The author then interrupted the lecture, said thanks, and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the flight attendant might have rules about first-class bathrooms being for first-class passengers only. Even if the author is close to first class, using that bathroom without being in first class could be against the airline's policies. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so they might have a point in addressing the author. Also, walking away when someone is talking to you, even if you don't agree, could be seen as disrespectful. The author's action of ignoring the FA after being followed back to their seat might escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that there was a long line in the back bathrooms, and the first-class one was empty. The FA was being overly strict, and the author had a long day. They might feel that in a situation where the alternative would mean waiting, using the available bathroom makes sense. The FA's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, especially if the author is a valued customer. The author also didn't argue or be rude, just walked away after a brief acknowledgment.\n\nI need to think about the rules. If the airline explicitly states that first-class bathrooms are for first-class passengers, then the author is violating that. However, the author says they've done this before without issues. Maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, or the FA was in a bad mood. But the FA's job is to enforce the policies, so even if others don't get caught, the author is still technically wrong. \n\nRegarding the interaction: interrupting with a \"thank you\" and walking away. That's a bit abrupt, but maybe the author was trying to de-escalate. The FA then followed and raised her voice. The author's response was to ignore her, which could be seen as being rude back. However, the author's perspective is that the lecture was unnecessary and they were just trying to end the conversation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they used a bathroom not intended for their class, that's a policy violation. But if the policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, maybe not. The argument about being rude for walking away is subjective. In a professional setting, the FA might expect more respect. But the author could argue that the FA was being unreasonable. I think it's a mix. The author might be in the wrong for using the first-class bathroom without permission, but the FA's reaction was also harsh. However, the question is about the author's actions. The answer likely depends on the airline's rules. If the rules clearly prohibit it, then the author is wrong. But since they've done it before without being told, maybe the FA's reaction is the issue here. Still, the act of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as rude regardless. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for both using the inappropriate bathroom and for how they handled the interaction.\n"
