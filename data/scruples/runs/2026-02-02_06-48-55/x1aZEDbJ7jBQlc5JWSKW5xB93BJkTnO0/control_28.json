I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting just behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, and when there's a backup, they used the first class bathroom. The FA then confronted them, the author walked away, and the FA followed up with a comment about being rude.\n\nSo, the key points here. Are there rules against using first class bathrooms if you're not in first class? The author mentions they've done it before without issues. But maybe there's a policy they weren't aware of. Flight attendants are responsible for enforcing rules to maintain order and safety. Even if the author didn't know, they could be expected to follow the guidelines.\n\nThen, when confronted, the author walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The author's response was to ignore the FA. In a professional setting, especially on a flight, employees need to be respected. Walking away during a confrontation could be seen as dismissive. The FA might have been handling it in a harsh way, but the author's action of walking off and ignoring the follow-up could be considered disrespectful, even if they were stressed.\n\nAlso, the context mentions the FA was already acting strict, maybe overzealous. But that doesn't excuse the passenger's behavior. The question is about the author's actions. Even if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, the right approach might have been to listen, apologize, or at least not walk away. The author's justification about a long day doesn't mitigate the action. The FA's job is to enforce policies, and the passenger's responsibility is to comply, even if there's a disagreement.\n\nSo, while the FA might have overstepped, the author's choice to walk away and ignore the FA could be seen as inconsiderate and uncooperative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
