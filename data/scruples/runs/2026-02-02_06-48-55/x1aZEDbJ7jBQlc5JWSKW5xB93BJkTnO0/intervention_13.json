I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. So the scenario is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in economy, behind first class.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The person has premier status, sits behind first class. Before landing, the flight attendant (FA) makes an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom now. There's a long line at the back bathrooms, but the first class bathroom is empty. The author uses the first class bathroom. Then the FA confronts them, gives a lecture, the author walks away, and the FA follows and calls them rude.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Airline regulations usually specify that first class amenities are for first class passengers only. Even if the author is in a premium seat, like if they have status but are in economy, they might still be restricted. Using the first class bathroom could be against policies to ensure fairness and safety. \n\nThe author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe that's a red herring because different flight attendants might enforce rules differently. Also, the FA was acting strange, but that doesn't mean the rules aren't in place. The author's action could be seen as violating a rule, even if it's inconvenient. \n\nWhen the FA confronts them, the author interrupts and walks away. Walking away when someone is speaking to you, even if you're annoyed, can be considered disrespectful. The FA was trying to enforce a rule, and the author dismissed her. The FA then followed them and called them rude, which the author ignores. \n\nSo the key points: Did the author break a rule by using the first class bathroom? Probably yes. Even if they've done it before, it's still a policy they're supposed to follow. Then, interrupting and walking away is rude, especially in a professional setting. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the author's response was uncooperative. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The author had a long day and the FA was being overly strict. However, that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The FA might be strict, but the rules are there for a reason. The author's justification that they're a frequent flyer and have status might not matter if the policy is clear. \n\nSo, in terms of the author's responsibility: They violated a rule, then acted disrespectfully by ignoring the FA. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
