I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) reprimanded them, and the author walked away and ignored the FA.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. Airlines usually have policies about who can use first class amenities. The author mentions they're not upgraded but have premier status. Maybe premier status allows access to first class facilities? If so, then using the bathroom there might be allowed. But if the policy says only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the author is violating the rules.\n\nThe author says they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That suggests maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced, or maybe the author's status allows it. However, the FA might have changed the rules or there could be a specific reason this time. The FA's behavior was described as \"bizarre\" and strict, so maybe they were having a bad day or there was a new regulation.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author break the rules? If yes, then walking away when reprimanded could be rude. The FA was doing their job, and the author's response was dismissive. Even if the FA was acting in a strange way, the author should probably address the concern politely. Walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known the rules clearly, and the FA's reaction was harsh. If the rules aren't clear or if this is a common practice, the author might not be entirely at fault. But generally, when an employee is enforcing a rule, even if they're strict, the customer is expected to comply. The author's decision to walk away and ignore the lecture could be seen as inconsiderate and uncooperative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for using the bathroom against the rules (if it's against policy) and for walking away from the FA. Even if the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response would be to listen or politely explain, not to ignore them. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
