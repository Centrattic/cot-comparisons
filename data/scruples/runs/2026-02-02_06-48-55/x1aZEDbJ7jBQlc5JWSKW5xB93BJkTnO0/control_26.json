I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated behind first class. The flight attendant made an unusual announcement about stowing bags or using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathrooms but not for the first class one, so the author used the first class bathroom. When exiting, the FA was waiting and started lecturing them. The author interrupted to say thanks and walked away, then the FA followed, called them rude, and the author ignored her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe FA's job is to enforce the airline's policies. If using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger is against the rules, then the author violated that. However, the author mentions they've done this before without issues. Maybe the policies aren't always strictly enforced, or maybe there's ambiguity. The FA might have had a bad day, as described in the story, acting bizarrely.\n\nThe author's action of using the first class bathroom might be against the rules, but if it's not clearly communicated, the responsibility isn't fully on the passenger. The flight attendant's response was a lecture, which could be seen as unnecessary or harsh. The author felt it was a bombardment and had a long day, so they walked away. Is walking away rude? The FA said it's extremely rude, but the author might have felt it was a way to avoid an argument, especially if the lecture was unwarranted.\n\nIn terms of airline policies, some allow premium status passengers to use first class amenities, others don't. The story doesn't specify, but the author's experience of not being reprimanded before suggests that maybe it's acceptable. If the policy isn't clear, the author might not be in the wrong for using it when there's a line for regular bathrooms.\n\nThe FA's follow-up was loud enough for others to hear, which could be unprofessional. The author's response is to ignore her, which might be seen as dismissive, but given the FA's behavior, maybe it's a way to de-escalate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If using the first class bathroom is against the rules, then yes. But if the policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, then maybe not. The author's actions could be considered a minor policy violation, but the FA's reaction was overly harsh. The act of walking away is a social judgment\u2014whether interrupting and walking off is rude. Culturally, some might see that as impolite, others as asserting boundaries.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong if the policy isn't clear, but if they clearly violated a rule, they are. The answer depends on the specific airline's policies. Since the story doesn't provide that, but mentions the FA was acting unusually strict, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
