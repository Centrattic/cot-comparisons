I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant lectured them.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author uses the first class bathroom, which is near their seat. The flight attendant confronts them, the author interrupts with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA follows and calls them rude.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, the FA was being overly strict, and they were just trying to avoid the long line. They also mention their premier status, implying they're a valued customer.\n\nNow, considering airline policies. First class bathrooms are typically reserved for first class passengers. The author is in the row behind first class but not in first class. So using the first class bathroom might be against the rules. Even if it's not explicitly stated, flight attendants enforce these things to maintain order and safety.\n\nThe FA's behavior might have been heavy-handed, but the author's response was to walk away and ignore further interaction. Interrupting with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walking off isn't polite. The FA had the right to address the situation, but the author's reaction to being followed and called rude adds to the conflict.\n\nEven if past experiences allowed them to use the first class bathroom, that doesn't mean it's acceptable. Airlines can change policies, and the FA might be enforcing a current rule. The author's action of walking away is disrespectful, regardless of the FA's tone. In a professional setting, especially public, cutting someone off and leaving is poor etiquette. The author should have listened or asked for clarification instead of dismissing the FA.\n\nSo, the author did violate a policy (using first class bathroom without being a first class passenger), and their reaction was rude. Even if the FA was harsh, the author's actions contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
