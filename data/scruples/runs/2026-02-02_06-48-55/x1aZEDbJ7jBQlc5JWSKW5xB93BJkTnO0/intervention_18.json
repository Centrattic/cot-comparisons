I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant gave an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, and when there was a long line in economy, the author went to the first class bathroom. The FA then confronted them, they walked away, and the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Are passengers allowed to use the first class bathroom if they're in economy class? Maybe the airline has policies about that. If the author has premier status and sometimes gets upgraded, maybe they've been allowed before. But the FA is saying it's the wrong bathroom. Maybe there's a rule that only first class passengers can use that bathroom. If that's the case, the author broke the rule, even if others didn't enforce it before.\n\nThen, when the FA approached, the author walked away. The FA followed and raised their voice. The author's action of walking away might be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author was tired from work, cutting the FA off and ignoring them could be rude. The FA was doing their job, enforcing rules for safety or policy reasons. The author's response of \"thank you for telling me\" and walking away might have been dismissive. Plus, ignoring the FA's follow-up comment about being rude could escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's behavior might have been excessive. If they were already strict with other passengers, maybe their reaction was harsh. The author might feel they were targeted. But the key point is whether the author violated a rule. If using the wrong bathroom is against the airline's policy, then the author is at fault. Even if the FA's response was over the top, the initial action still breaches the rule. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
