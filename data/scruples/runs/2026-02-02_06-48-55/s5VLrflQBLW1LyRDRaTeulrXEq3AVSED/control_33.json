We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman who wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's been controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. However, the author is a responsible parent and breadwinner, contributing 80% of the family income. She wants to have some fun and socialize, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior includes being very insistent, controlling, and possibly causing issues if she goes out despite his protests. He's not physically abusive, but his emotional control is a problem.\n\nMarriage should allow both partners to have their own social lives. It's normal for individuals to maintain friendships and personal interests outside the marriage. The husband's lack of trust and control over her decisions is problematic. The fact that he doesn't want her to go out without him, even if it's just occasionally with friends, suggests a lack of independence and trust in their relationship. His insistence on being the only social outlet might stem from his own insecurities or control issues, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe author's request to socialize isn't excessive\u2014once in a while. She's not planning to go out weekly. The husband's reaction, like tracking her down or causing scenes, is overbearing and controlling. The author's uncertainty might come from her background and long-term relationship without comparison, but that doesn't mean her desire for social time is wrong. It's important for her to have autonomy and personal freedom. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people would agree that a spouse should have the right to socialize without the other's constant presence. The husband's control and lack of trust are the real issues here. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. The answer should be B.\n"
