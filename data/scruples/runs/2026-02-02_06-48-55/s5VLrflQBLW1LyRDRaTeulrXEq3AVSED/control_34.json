We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the mother) is in the wrong here. So, she's a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with her friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They used to go to the bar regularly when they were younger, but now he's not into it. He's not against her going out every week or even once a month, just once in a while. The husband is insistent and controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. In many healthy relationships, both partners should have some independence. It's common for people to have friends and social lives outside the marriage. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to sit home alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband seems controlling. He's making decisions about her social activities, which isn't healthy. \n\nHe also mentions he's not physically abusive but has a lot of control. That sounds like emotional control or possessiveness. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she doesn't know what's normal because of her own family background adds another layer. She might be in a relationship where she's been isolated or controlled for a long time without realizing it.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy in a marriage and the husband's controlling behavior. The author is asking if it's okay to go out without him. From an outsider's perspective, wanting to socialize with friends is normal and healthy. The husband's reaction suggests he doesn't respect her autonomy, which is a red flag. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her own social time. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
