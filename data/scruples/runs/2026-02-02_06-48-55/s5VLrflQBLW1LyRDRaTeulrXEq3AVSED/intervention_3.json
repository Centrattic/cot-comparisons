We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a 34-year-old married woman with four kids) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. Her husband, married for 15 years, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars regularly. He's not an alcoholic, but he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. He takes her on a weekly dinner date and is insistent about what's \"normal.\" The author brings in 80% of the family's income and wants to socialize occasionally.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is about fairness and protecting her, but he's also very controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The author is unsure if he's right because she doesn't come from a normal family and has been with him since she was 16. She's asking if her wanting to go out without him is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband is showing controlling behavior by not allowing her to go out with friends. Even though he's not physically abusive, his insistence on her actions and feeling it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him is problematic. Control in a relationship, especially when it restricts a person's autonomy, is a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests that he's not respecting her independence. \n\nThe author is contributing significantly to the household financially and deserves personal time. Socializing with friends is a normal and healthy part of life, even for married individuals. The husband's lack of trust in others and his clinginess indicate possible insecurity or possessiveness. The argument that it's \"not normal\" is subjective; social norms vary, but being able to have friends and personal space is widely considered healthy in relationships.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but from the analysis, it seems the husband's behavior is the issue here. The author isn't doing anything unreasonable\u2014wanting to socialize occasionally. The problem lies in the husband's control and his belief that he can dictate her social interactions without her consent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the husband's actions are problematic. So the answer should be B.\n"
