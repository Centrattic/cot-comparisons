We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. He feels it's not appropriate and might react strongly if she does. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband is being controlling and doesn't allow her to socialize without him. Even though he's not physically abusive, his insistence on control and lack of trust in people could be problematic. The author brings in most of the income, which adds complexity because she's contributing significantly, yet her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy in a marriage. It's common for people to have friends and social lives outside of their spouse. The husband's behavior seems overbearing, especially since the author wants to go out only occasionally. The fact that the husband might track her down or cause a scene suggests that he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn many healthy relationships, partners support each other's social needs. The husband's reasoning about it not being fair for him to be alone might be a projection of his own insecurities rather than a valid reason to restrict her. The author's confusion about normalcy because of her upbringing and long-term relationship with the husband could also indicate that she's internalizing his control.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
