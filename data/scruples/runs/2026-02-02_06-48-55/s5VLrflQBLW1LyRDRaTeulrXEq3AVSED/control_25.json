We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's a married mom with four kids, and she wants to go out with her friends occasionally. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's been this way for the past ten years, and he's controlling to some extent, even though not physically abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been married for 15 years, and he's been resistant to social outings for a decade. That's a long time. She brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate she's a breadwinner, but that's not directly related to the social aspect. She wants to have some fun once in a while, which seems reasonable. The husband, however, is controlling and doesn't trust people, being clingy. He might be projecting his own discomfort with social situations onto her, or maybe he feels insecure.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's control and the lack of social life for the author. The question is whether wanting to go out with friends is unreasonable. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy and personal space. The husband's reaction\u2014potentially causing a scene or keeping her up all night\u2014suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. He also claims it's about protecting her, but his behavior seems more about control. \n\nThe author mentions she's not sure what's normal because her family background isn't normal and she's been with her husband since 16. So she might not have a good reference point for a healthy relationship. The fact that the husband can be very convincing makes it harder for her to assert herself. \n\nLegally and ethically, in most societies, a spouse cannot control the other's social life to that extent without it being considered controlling behavior. The husband's insistence that it's \"not fair\" for him to be alone might be a form of emotional manipulation. The author has a right to her own social interactions, especially since they don't involve alcohol and are occasional. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life. The issue lies with the husband's controlling behavior and lack of respect for her autonomy. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
