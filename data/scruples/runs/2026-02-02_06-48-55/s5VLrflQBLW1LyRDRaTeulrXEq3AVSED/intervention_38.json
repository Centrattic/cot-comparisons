We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a married woman wanting to go out with her friends, but her husband is against it. She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and they used to go out before. Now, the husband doesn't want to go out socially and thinks it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author mentions that she doesn't want to go out every week or even monthly, just \"once in a while.\" The husband is insistent, maybe a bit controlling, and he's not physically abusive but uses emotional control. He takes her on a dinner date weekly and wants to spend time with her, but he doesn't want her to have friends' time without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of a healthy marriage. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize without the other. The husband's reasoning about not wanting to be alone might be his issue, but it's not a valid reason to restrict her. The husband's control over her actions, even if not physical, seems problematic. The fact that he's been like this for a decade and she's been with him since she was 16 might mean she's used to it, but that doesn't make it right. She's bringing in most of the family income, which could imply she's a strong individual, so her desire for autonomy is valid.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The key points here are the husband's control and the author's right to personal time. The question is about socializing without the spouse. In most relationships, having friends and some independence is considered healthy. The husband's insistence that it's not normal might stem from his own issues, like low self-esteem or insecurity, but that's not her responsibility. The author is seeking balance, not neglecting her family. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting that balance. The husband's behavior, on the other hand, is more concerning because he's controlling and doesn't trust her or others. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
