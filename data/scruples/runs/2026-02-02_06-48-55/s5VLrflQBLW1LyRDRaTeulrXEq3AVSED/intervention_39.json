We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, feels it's not appropriate, and might react strongly if she does. The author is responsible, brings in most of the income, and just wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband is controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. He's been with her since she was 16, which might affect her sense of independence. The key points are the husband's control and his possible overprotectiveness. The author is seeking validation on whether her desire for social time is normal.\n\nIn terms of normalcy in marriage, it's generally accepted that both partners should have some autonomy and personal space. Socializing with friends is a common need for mental health and social support. However, the husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, not letting her sleep. That points to a lack of trust and possibly emotional control.\n\nThe author isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally. She's responsible, so there's no indication of neglecting responsibilities. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life could be a red flag for emotional abuse or an overbearing relationship. The fact that she's unsure because of her upbringing and his convincing nature adds to the complexity.\n\nSo, the author's desire isn't unreasonable. The issue lies more with the husband's controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. It's about the husband's actions, not her wanting to have friends. So the answer should be B.\n"
