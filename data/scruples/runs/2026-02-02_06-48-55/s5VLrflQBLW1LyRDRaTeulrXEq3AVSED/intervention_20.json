We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insists on being with her, and doesn't trust others. She brings in 80% of the income and feels restricted. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to evaluate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband's behavior seems controlling and possibly restrictive. He doesn't allow her to socialize without him, which could be a form of emotional control. The key factors here are consent, mutual respect, and autonomy in the marriage. The author is seeking personal time with friends, which is a reasonable desire for many people. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might not justify controlling her actions. Also, the fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nControl in a relationship should be mutual, not one-sided. The husband's insistence on being with her all the time and his lack of trust could be signs of possessiveness or insecurity. The author's financial contribution shows she's a significant provider, which might mean her independence is important. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but based on the information, it seems the husband's controlling behavior is the issue. The question is about normalcy in marriage regarding socializing. Generally, healthy relationships allow both partners some independence. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
