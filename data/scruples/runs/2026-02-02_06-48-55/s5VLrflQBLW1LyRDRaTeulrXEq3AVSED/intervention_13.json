We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars before. Now he's insistent it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's reasoning is about not wanting to be alone and his belief in what's \"normal.\" But the wife is feeling controlled, even though she's the main breadwinner. The key points are about autonomy and social needs in a marriage. \n\nThe husband's behavior sounds controlling. He's not physically abusive but uses emotional control, like tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out. That's a red flag. The wife's desire for some social time is reasonable. Most people need personal space and social interactions, even in marriage. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but based on the details, the husband's control is problematic. The wife isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional fun. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess further indicate an issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the husband's control is the main issue here, not her wanting to socialize.\n"
