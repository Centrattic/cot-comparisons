We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the married mom is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They've been married for 15 years and used to go to bars together, but now he's against it. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her spouse. The author just wants to do something fun occasionally, like with friends. She brings in 80% of the family income, so she's financially responsible. However, her husband seems to be controlling. If she goes out anyway, he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up discussing it. He's not physically abusive but is clingy and distrustful. The author isn't sure if his reasoning is right because she grew up in a non-normal family and has been with him since 16, so she doesn't have much else to compare.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess that. Let's consider the key points. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He doesn't trust her, is insistent, and might act in ways that pressure her. The author is seeking independence, which is understandable. Socializing is a basic need, and it's not unreasonable for her to want that. The husband's argument against it as \"not appropriate\" might be his way of maintaining control. The fact that he's not physically abusive but still exerts control through emotional means is concerning. The author's financial contribution also adds a layer where her autonomy is further restricted by his control.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's reaction suggests a lack of trust and possible emotional manipulation. The author's desire to maintain friendships is valid. Her husband's behavior, however, is overstepping. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to go out. The issue lies more with the husband's controlling behavior rather than her wanting to socialize. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
