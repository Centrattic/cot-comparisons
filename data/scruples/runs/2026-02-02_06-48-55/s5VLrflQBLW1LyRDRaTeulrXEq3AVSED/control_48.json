We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a married woman with four kids) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially, thinking it's not appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. He's been married to her since she was 16, so maybe their relationship started when she was pretty young. Now she's 34, and they've been married for 15 years. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. He might be using the excuse that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. The woman brings in 80% of the family's income, which is significant. She wants to have some social time, which is reasonable. The husband might react badly if she goes against his wishes, like tracking her down or causing a scene. \n\nThe key here is autonomy in a marriage. It's generally expected that adults in a relationship should have some independence. The husband's control over her decisions might be an issue. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and she's only now seeking some social time could indicate a pattern of controlling behavior. Also, the woman mentions she doesn't have a normal family background and might not know what's normal, which the husband uses to his advantage.\n\nShe's looking for validation on whether it's okay for her to go out. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From a modern perspective, it's normal for individuals to maintain their own social lives, even in marriage. The husband's insistence on her not going out without him could be seen as controlling. The woman's desire to have some independence isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, the user might be concerned about the potential conflict. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she should go against his wishes. Since the husband's behavior seems controlling and the woman is seeking a basic form of autonomy, the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is problematic, and wanting to have some social time isn't unreasonable.\n"
