We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman with four kids, wanting to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's been like this for ten years and is controlling, not physically abusive but very insistent. She wants to know if she's in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are her desire for personal freedom, his controlling behavior, and the lack of social interaction for her. The husband's reasoning is based on his own discomfort and a belief that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse. However, societal norms have evolved, and many people do have friends and socialize independently in marriages. \n\nThe husband's behavior includes controlling aspects, like not trusting people, being clingy, and possibly causing scenes if she goes. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The woman brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate she's more independent financially, but that's not directly related to social needs. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a modern perspective, wanting to have friends and socialize is normal and healthy. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life could be part of an emotionally controlling relationship. The fact that she's been with him since 16 and doesn't have a normal family background might mean she's used to this dynamic and doesn't realize it's harmful. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here, and she has a right to personal space and social connections. The community would likely support her wanting to maintain her own social life as part of a healthy marriage.\n"
