We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a woman who's been married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars together. Now, he feels it's not appropriate and wants to spend time with her instead. The husband isn't abusive but is very controlling and insists on being right. The author is conflicted because she doesn't have a normal family background to compare to and has been with her husband since she was 16.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's making rules about her socializing, which could be a sign of emotional control or possessiveness. The author wants some independence, which is a normal part of a healthy marriage where both partners have their own social lives. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to be alone is a bit self-centered. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect is key. If the husband is making her feel like she can't have any personal time, that's a problem. The fact that he might cause a scene or disrupt her when she goes out is also concerning. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control and insistence on his version of \"normal\" can be toxic.\n\nThe author's need for socialization is valid. Many people need time away from their families to recharge. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess might stem from insecurity or past issues, but it doesn't justify controlling behavior. The author is responsible for 80% of the income, which adds to the imbalance in their relationship. She might feel trapped, especially since she mentions not having a normal family to compare to and being with her husband since 16. That could mean she's been in a long-term relationship without much independence.\n\nHowever, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the husband's concerns are valid. But in a healthy marriage, both partners should support each other's individual needs. The husband's control and lack of trust are red flags. The key points here are autonomy, mutual respect, and emotional health. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking her own social time. She's asking if it's normal to want that, and clearly, it is. So the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
