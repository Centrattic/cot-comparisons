We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's controlling, insists on being right, and might cause a scene if she goes out. She brings in 80% of the income, which is notable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of their relationship. The husband's behavior seems controlling and restrictive. He doesn't trust people, is clingy, and wants to control her social interactions. That sounds like emotional control, which isn't healthy. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe author is seeking validation about whether it's normal to socialize without a spouse. Socializing is a basic need, and many healthy relationships allow for individual social time. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone or that it's not normal is questionable. Normality varies, but control and lack of trust are red flags.\n\nAlso, the author comes from a non-normal family background, which might have influenced her perception of what's normal. She's been with her husband since 16, so she might lack experience with other relationship models. Her financial contribution doesn't negate her right to personal time.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while she has family obligations, personal well-being is important. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions without considering her needs is problematic. The key issue is the imbalance of power and the control he exerts. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain her social life; healthy relationships should support each other's individual needs. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
