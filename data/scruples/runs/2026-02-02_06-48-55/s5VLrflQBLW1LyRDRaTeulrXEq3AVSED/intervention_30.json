We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The setup is that the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. They used to go to bars together but he hasn't wanted to in the last ten years. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling, insistent, and doesn't trust people. The author is responsible for most of the family income and feels restricted. She's unsure because her husband is convincing and they've been together since she was 16, so she doesn't have a comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered normal in a marriage regarding socializing. Generally, in healthy relationships, both partners should have some independence. The husband's insistence on her not going out without him seems controlling. He's not allowing her space to socialize, which could be a sign of possessiveness or lack of trust. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes anyway indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is still a red flag. The author's desire to have some fun and connect with friends is reasonable. The husband's reasoning about fairness and normality might be his way of justifying control. The author's uncertainty stems from her upbringing and long-term relationship, making it harder to see the imbalance. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people would argue that each partner should have some personal freedom. The husband's behavior could be stifling her social life and personal growth, which is important for a healthy marriage. The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by wanting to spend time with friends. The key issue is the husband's control rather than the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a normal level of independence that's often expected in a balanced relationship.\n"
