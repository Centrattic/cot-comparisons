We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman is married for 15 years, has four kids, and wants some social time. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and gets clingy. He's not physically abusive but exerts control. She's responsible for most of the family income and feels restricted. She's unsure because her upbringing wasn't normal and she's been with her husband since 16, so she doesn't have a frame of reference.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy and healthy relationships. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and possessive, which isn't healthy. The woman wanting to maintain her own social life isn't unreasonable. She's not asking to go out frequently, just occasionally. The husband's reactions, like tracking her down or causing scenes, are signs of insecurity and control issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since wanting to have friends and socialize is normal, and the husband's restrictions are overbearing, the woman isn't in the wrong. She's seeking validation for her need for personal space and autonomy. The answer should be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
