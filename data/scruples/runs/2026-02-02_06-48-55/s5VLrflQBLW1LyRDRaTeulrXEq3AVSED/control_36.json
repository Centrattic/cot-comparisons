For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband.

He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband, 38, has not wanted to go out socially for the past ten years. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author wants to go out with friends occasionally, not regularly. She mentions that her husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her one-on-one or in family settings. However, he gets upset if she goes out without him, possibly causing a scene or making her come home, not physically abusive but very controlling. He also doesn't trust people and is clingy. The author isn't sure if her husband is right because she comes from an unstable family and has been with him since she was 16, so she doesn't have a good frame of reference.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault for wanting to go out. So, the key points here are about autonomy in a marriage, social needs, and possible control issues from the husband.\n\nFirst, in a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize independently. It's normal for people to have friends and to want to engage in activities outside of their immediate family. The husband's stance that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband seems controlling and restrictive. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes against his wishes indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy and possibly an issue with control.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to be alone is his own emotional need, but that doesn't justify controlling her actions. His insistence on what is \"normal\" might stem from his own insecurities or distrust, but that doesn't make it right. The author's desire to maintain some independence is valid, especially given her contribution to the family income and her need for personal time.\n\nHowever, the author's background complicates things. She mentions coming from an unstable family and being with her husband since 16. This could mean she might not have had models for healthy relationships, leading her to accept behaviors that are actually controlling. Her husband's behavior\u2014being clingy, distrustful, and trying to control her social interactions\u2014could be signs of emotional manipulation or even a toxic relationship.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, wanting to socialize without a spouse isn't inherently wrong. It's a common need for many people to maintain their own social life. The husband's reaction seems excessive and controlling. The author isn't doing anything that would harm the family or her responsibilities; she's seeking balance in her life.\n\nHowever, some might argue that communication is key. The author hasn't mentioned if she's tried to discuss her needs with her husband or if there's mutual understanding. But given the husband's reactions, it seems communication isn't effective, and he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
