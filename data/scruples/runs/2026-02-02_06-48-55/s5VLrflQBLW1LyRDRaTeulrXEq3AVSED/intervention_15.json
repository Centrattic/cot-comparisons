We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the married woman in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to go out with her friends. The options are A (she is in the wrong) or B (she isn't). I need to consider the details provided.\n\nSo, the woman is married for 15 years, has four kids, and used to go out to the bar regularly. Now, her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He says it's not appropriate for a married woman. She doesn't want to go every week or even monthly, just occasionally. The husband is taking her out on dinner dates weekly, but he's also controlling, insists on being with her, and doesn't trust people. He can be clingy and might cause a scene if she goes out without him. She's responsible for 80% of the family income. The husband isn't physically abusive but has a lot of control and is very insistent. She's uncertain because her family background isn't normal and she's been with him since 16.\n\nFirst, the key issue is her right to socialize without her husband. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have independence. The husband's control over her social life is a red flag. He's using traditional gender roles (\"it's not appropriate for a married woman\") to justify his control, which might be outdated. Also, his clinginess and lack of trust are problematic. She's contributing to the family income, so she's not just a homemaker, which adds to her need for personal time.\n\nThe husband's reaction if she goes out\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up\u2014suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. The woman's desire for occasional fun is reasonable. She's not asking for frequent outings but just some socialization, which is normal for mental health and well-being. The husband's control issues might stem from insecurity or other problems, but that doesn't make it acceptable.\n\nThe user's own initial thought is that she's in the wrong, but I think the opposite. The husband's behavior is more concerning. The woman is seeking validation for her need for independence, which is a common issue in long-term relationships. The fact that she's been with him since 16 and has an unstable family background might make her more susceptible to his control, but she's still within her rights to want personal space. Therefore, the answer should be B (she is not in the wrong).\n"
