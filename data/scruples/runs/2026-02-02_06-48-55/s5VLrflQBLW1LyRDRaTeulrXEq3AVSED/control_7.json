We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman with four kids, asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially, even though they've been married for 15 years. He's not opposed to alcohol but is concerned about her going out without him. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and can be clingy. She brings in 80% of the family income and wants some independence.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about normal social behavior in a marriage. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. But the woman is asking if that's actually the case.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, it's generally accepted that individuals in a marriage should have the freedom to socialize independently. The husband's control over her actions and lack of trust could indicate issues like possessiveness or insecurity. The fact that he's been controlling since they were teenagers (she was 16) and that she comes from an unstable family background might mean she hasn't had the chance to see healthy relationships. His behavior of possibly tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out is concerning.\n\nThe woman is asking if her desire for some personal time and social interaction is valid. Since she's contributing significantly to the household and it's just occasional, it's reasonable. The husband's insistence that it's not normal is likely based on his own discomfort rather than societal norms. So the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The husband's controlling behavior is the issue here, not her wanting to go out occasionally.\n"
