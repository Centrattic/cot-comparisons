We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go out before, but for the last ten years, he's been against it. He argues it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The author wants to do something fun occasionally, not frequently. She mentions he takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her, but he doesn't trust others and is clingy. He might cause a scene or make her come home if she goes out. He's not physically abusive but exerts a lot of control. The author is unsure if he's right because she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since 16, so she doesn't have much to compare.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy, control in the relationship, and social norms. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and protecting her, but his behavior sounds controlling. The author is seeking validation for her desire to have independence. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's insistence on tracking her down or causing a scene indicates a lack of trust and possible emotional control. The fact that she's responsible for most of the income might also play into her needing personal space. The answer should focus on the balance between respecting each other's needs and the red flags in the husband's behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to socialize; it's about her right to personal freedom.\n"
