We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to socialize with friends without her husband. The author is a married woman with four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He's been this way for the past ten years, and he's against it because he thinks it's not appropriate for a married woman to do so. The husband isn't physically abusive but is described as controlling, insistent, and not trusting others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman wants to go out occasionally, maybe once in a while, not every week. The husband's reasoning is about fairness because he would be alone, and he feels it's not normal. However, the key points here are the husband's control over her and his insistence on being right. The woman is responsible and brings in most of the family income, which suggests she's a contributing member, so her desire for personal time might be valid.\n\nThe husband's behavior includes potential emotional control, like possibly tracking her down or causing a scene if she goes out despite his protests. This could indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy. The woman also mentions that she's been with him since she was 16, so her sense of what's normal might be skewed by their long-term relationship without comparison.\n\nIn terms of normal marital norms, many couples do have some level of independence. Socializing with friends without the spouse is common and can be healthy for relationships, as it allows individuals to maintain their own identities and social outlets. The husband's insistence that it's not normal might be his way of maintaining control rather than reflecting actual societal norms.\n\nThe author's wanting to go out is about her personal autonomy and mental well-being. The husband's control over her actions, even if not physically abusive, might be emotionally manipulative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for seeking that independence. Given that the husband's behavior is controlling and the desire for occasional social time is reasonable, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue lies more with the husband's response and control rather than her desire to go out.\n"
