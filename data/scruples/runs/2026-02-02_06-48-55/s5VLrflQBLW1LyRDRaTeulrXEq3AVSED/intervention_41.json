We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (a married mom) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent. She brings in most of the income.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. First, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The husband's stance is based on his beliefs about what's appropriate, but his behavior sounds controlling. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The wife wants some independence and social time, which is a basic need. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's reaction\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, or keeping her up\u2014sounds manipulative and controlling. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The wife is responsible and brings in most of the income, which might add to the imbalance. \n\nThe question is about normal socializing in marriage. Generally, it's considered normal for married individuals to have friends and social activities without their spouse. The husband's insistence on being present for all social interactions seems excessive. The wife's desire to have fun once in a while isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I think that's because they might not see the control aspect. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. The wife isn't doing anything wrong by seeking her own social needs. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
