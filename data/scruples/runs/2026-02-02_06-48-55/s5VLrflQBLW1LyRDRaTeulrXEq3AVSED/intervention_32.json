We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they've been married for 15 years and he used to go out before. Now he's against it, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. The author is responsible, brings in 80% of the income, and just wants to do something fun occasionally. The husband might track her down or cause a scene if she goes, but isn't physically abusive. He's controlling, insistent, and doesn't trust people.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the husband's reasoning: he feels it's not fair for him to be alone and it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. But this seems controlling. The husband is limiting her autonomy, especially when she's not doing it frequently. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she doesn't know what's normal could indicate a lack of independence for her. The husband's behavior\u2014tracking her down, causing a scene, or keeping her up discussing it\u2014is manipulative and overbearing. Even if he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. \n\nThe author is seeking validation about what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The husband isn't respecting her need for social interaction, which is a basic need. The fact that she's a working mom and contributes significantly to the income makes it even more important for her to have personal time. The husband's insistence on controlling her actions could be a form of emotional abuse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's behavior is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
