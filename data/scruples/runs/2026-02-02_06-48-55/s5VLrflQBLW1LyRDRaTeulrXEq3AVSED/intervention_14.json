We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent. She brings in 80% of the family income and just wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and what's normal for a married woman. He's against her going out without him, possibly out of control and clinginess. The author feels she should have the right to socialize occasionally. The key points are autonomy, control in the marriage, and societal norms.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems to be overstepping. He's not abusive physically but uses emotional control. He might be trying to maintain dominance in the relationship. The author's desire to have her own social life is a basic need for many people, especially after years of being in a controlling marriage. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but that might be because of traditional views on married women's socializing. However, modern perspectives emphasize mutual respect and individual needs in a relationship. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life could be seen as toxic. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional fun. The husband's behavior is more concerning than her desire to socialize.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with her husband since 16, which might mean she's had a skewed view of relationships. The husband's controlling behavior is the main issue here. Her wanting to assert her independence isn't wrong. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
