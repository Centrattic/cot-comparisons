We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman who wants to go out with friends but her husband doesn't support it. They've been married 15 years, have four kids. The husband feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him, even though they used to go out regularly before.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the husband's control over her social activities. He's insistent, doesn't trust others, and can be clingy. The woman is responsible for most of the income, which suggests she's contributing significantly to the family. She's requesting just occasional social time, not regular. The husband's reaction could be overbearing, like tracking her down or causing scenes. \n\nThe user is questioning if she's in the wrong for wanting this. The key here is autonomy in a marriage. A healthy relationship should allow both partners personal space and socialization. The husband's behavior seems controlling, not respecting her needs. Also, the fact that he's been with her since she was 16 and she has nothing to compare to might mean she's stayed in a dynamic where her independence is limited.\n\nThe husband's argument about it being unfair for him to be alone is his issue, not hers. Her right to personal time shouldn't be contingent on his comfort. The response from others (AITA) would likely side with the woman needing space. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
