We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a married woman with four kids) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they were more social in the past. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. She wants some independence, brings in most of the income, and feels he's being overprotective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage. Generally, a healthy marriage allows both partners some independence. The husband's behavior seems controlling here. He's making her feel that she can't go out without him, which isn't typical. Even though they were close for a long time and she might not have a frame of reference, his insistence on controlling her social life is a red flag. The fact that he might cause a scene or discuss it all night if she goes shows a lack of trust and possible emotional manipulation. She's responsible, contributing financially, and just wants some fun. So, from a typical standards perspective, she's not in the wrong. The husband's actions are more concerning. The answer should be B.\n"
