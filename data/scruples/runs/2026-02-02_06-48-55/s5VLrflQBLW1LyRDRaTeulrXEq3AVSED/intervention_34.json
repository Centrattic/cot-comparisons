We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years, with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar regularly before. Now, he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The husband isn't physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent that his way is normal.\n\nThe author mentions that she doesn't want to go out every week, just occasionally. She's responsible for most of the family income. If she goes out against his wishes, he might track her down or cause a scene. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and protecting her, but he's also clingy and doesn't trust people. The author is unsure because her family background is \"not normal\" and she's been with her husband since she was 16, so she doesn't know other relationships to compare.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious for a second opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are the husband's controlling behavior, lack of trust, and the author's desire for personal freedom. The husband's actions seem to be about control rather than genuine concern, especially since he's not physically abusive but uses emotional control. The author is seeking social time, which is a normal need. The husband's insistence on being the sole decision-maker in the relationship is problematic. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy and the ability to socialize. The husband's behavior, like possibly tracking her down or causing scenes, indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy suggests insecurity or control issues. The author's need to socialize isn't unreasonable, especially since they have four kids and she contributes significantly to the family income. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is wrong, but based on the analysis, the husband's behavior is more problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. The husband's control over her is the issue here. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the husband's controlling behavior versus the author's reasonable desire for social interaction.\n"
