We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends occasionally but her husband doesn't approve. He doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to bars together before. Now, she feels like she needs some social time, but he's being controlling and not trusting her. He's not physically abusive but is very insistent and might cause a scene if she goes out anyway.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their marriage. They've been together for 15 years, and he's been against social outings for the past ten. That's a long time. The husband's reasoning is about fairness because he would be alone and about what's \"normal\" for a married woman. But the author is contributing most of the income and feels she deserves some personal time. The key points here are autonomy, control, and social needs in a marriage.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems controlling. He doesn't trust her, is clingy, and has a lot of control over her. Even though he's trying to protect her, the way he's enforcing it might be unhealthy. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize independently unless there are specific reasons (like trust issues based on past behavior). There's no mention of her having a history that would justify his distrust.\n\nThe author is asking if it's normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. Generally, in a healthy marriage, each partner should have the right to personal time and social activities. The husband's insistence on being with her all the time and not allowing her to go out even occasionally could be a sign of jealousy or lack of trust. The fact that they used to go out together implies that it wasn't an issue before, so this change in his behavior might be due to his own insecurities or control issues.\n\nAlso, considering that the author came from an unstable family and hasn't had much comparison, she might not realize the boundaries of a healthy relationship. The husband's control could be more about his own need for security and less about her well-being. The author's request for occasional social time is reasonable and shouldn't be seen as wrong, especially since she's meeting her family responsibilities and contributing financially.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's behavior is problematic because he's restricting her autonomy without valid reasons. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
