We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a married woman wanting to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband objects because he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. They've been married 15 years, have four kids, and the husband doesn't want her to socialize without him, even though she makes 80% of the family's income. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insistent, and doesn't trust people. She's been with him since she was 16 and doesn't know what's normal.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is the husband's control over her social life. He's making it difficult for her to have her own time, which is a basic need in relationships. Even though he's not violent, his behavior is controlling and restrictive. The woman is seeking validation that having her own social life is normal. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's belief that she shouldn't go out without him seems to stem from insecurity or possessiveness. The fact that she wants to go out occasionally isn't unreasonable. She's not asking for frequent outings, just some fun once in a while. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. My thought is that the husband's behavior is problematic, not the author's desire for independence. The woman is not in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
