We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's controlling and insistent, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling. The author wants some social time, not every week, just occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems to be about control. He doesn't trust people, is clingy, and his reasoning is that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships allow both partners some independence. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes against his wishes shows he's trying to control her actions, which is unhealthy.\n\nThe author is a working parent contributing significantly to the family income. She's asking if wanting to socialize is normal. Socializing is important for mental health and personal well-being. The husband's lack of trust and the need for control could stem from insecurity or other issues, but that doesn't justify his behavior.\n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and mutual respect. The husband is not respecting her need for personal space and social interactions. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking to maintain her own social life. The husband's reaction, if he causes a scene or tries to control her, is the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's seeking normal social interaction, which is healthy. The husband's controlling behavior is the problem.\n"
