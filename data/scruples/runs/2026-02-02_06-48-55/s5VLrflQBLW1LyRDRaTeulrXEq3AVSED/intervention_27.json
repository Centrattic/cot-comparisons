We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insistent on his views. The author feels she should have some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband's stance seems controlling. He doesn't trust others and is clingy, which can be signs of an unhealthy relationship. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out shows his lack of respect for her autonomy. The author bringing in 80% of the income adds another layer; economic independence can influence power dynamics in a relationship.\n\nThe husband's argument that it's not fair for him to be alone is questionable. Marriage doesn't mean a person should completely forgo their own social life. Healthy relationships allow both partners to maintain individuality and social connections. The husband's insistence on controlling her socializing might stem from insecurity or possessiveness, which isn't healthy.\n\nThe author's desire to have some fun and socialize once in a while is normal. It's important for personal well-being and mental health. The fact that the husband was okay with going to bars before suggests that his current stance is more about control rather than a principle issue. Also, the author's background and lack of a normal family to compare to might make her more susceptible to his convincing arguments, but that doesn't mean she's wrong to seek change.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, trust, and healthy boundaries. The husband's behavior crosses into controlling territory by not allowing her to have her own social life. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her independence and social connections. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
