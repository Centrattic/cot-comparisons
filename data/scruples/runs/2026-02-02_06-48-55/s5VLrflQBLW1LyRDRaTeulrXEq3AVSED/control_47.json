We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (a married woman) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they both aren't alcoholics. He gets controlling and might cause a scene if she goes. She's a mom of four, responsible for most of the income, and they've been married for 15 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. The husband's reasoning is that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. But that sounds like a traditional or maybe controlling view. The key here is the husband's behavior\u2014he's being controlling, not physically abusive but insistent and clingy. The woman wants to have some independence and social time, which is reasonable. \n\nThe husband's control might be a red flag. Even if he's not abusive, being overly insistent and trying to control her actions could indicate a lack of respect for her autonomy. The woman works and contributes significantly, so she should have the right to her own social life. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's unsure because her family isn't normal and she's been with him since 16 shows she lacks a reference point. Others might see her desire for independence as normal. The husband's argument against it isn't valid because it's not about her safety but control. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here. She should be allowed to have her own social time. Answer B.\n"
