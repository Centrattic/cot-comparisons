We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the married woman) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nShe's married for 15 years, has four kids. They used to go to bars together when they were younger, but now her husband doesn't want to go out socially. He doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to do something fun occasionally, not every week or even monthly. The husband insists on taking her out on a dinner date weekly and wants to be with her in family settings. His reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. He's controlling, not physically abusive but very insistent, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. She's unsure because she grew up in a non-normal family and has been with him since 16, so she doesn't know what's normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: the husband's control over her social life, his insistence on being with her, and her desire for some independence. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have some autonomy. Socializing with friends is a normal part of adult life and can be important for mental health. The husband's stance seems to be controlling, as he doesn't trust her or others, and he's not allowing her to have her own social time. His argument that it's \"not normal\" is subjective and doesn't account for her needs. The fact that he might cause scenes or not let her sleep if she goes anyway indicates that he's overstepping, even if not physically abusive.\n\nThe woman is responsible, the primary earner, and just wants some fun. She's not asking for frequent outings, just occasionally. The husband's behavior is more concerning here because he's restricting her freedom without a valid reason. The fact that she's been with him since 16 and her family isn't normal might mean she's lacked a model for healthy relationships. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's controlling behavior is the issue. She's seeking balance and autonomy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
