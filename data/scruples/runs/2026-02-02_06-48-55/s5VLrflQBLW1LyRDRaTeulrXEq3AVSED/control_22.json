We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The woman is a married mom with four kids, married for 15 years. She and her husband used to go out to bars together when they were younger. Now, for the past ten years, he's been against her going out socially without him. He says it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, not every week or even monthly, just once in a while. She brings in 80% of the family income, so she's the primary earner.\n\nHer husband is not physically abusive but is very controlling. He might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up all night arguing if she goes out without him. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. She comes from a non-normal family, so she's unsure if his views are \"normal.\" They've been together since she was 16, so she's been in this relationship for a long time without other references.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without him. \n\nFirst, consider consent and autonomy in a marriage. A healthy relationship allows both partners some independence. The husband's insistence that she can't go out without him seems controlling. Even if he's not abusive, his behavior of potentially tracking her or causing scenes is problematic. His reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might be about his own jealousy or insecurity, not about her right to socialize. \n\nShe's asking if it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband. In most contexts, yes, it's normal and healthy to have friends and social life separate from your partner. The husband's control over her actions and convincing her that it's not normal might stem from his own possessiveness or low self-esteem.\n\nHer financial independence (being the main earner) also plays a role. She's contributing significantly to the family, so she should have autonomy in her personal time. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy suggests issues in the relationship that need addressing. \n\nShe's not asking to go out every week, just occasionally. His reaction if she goes against his wishes is extreme and controlling. The key points here are the control, lack of trust, and his behavior being overbearing. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's behavior is more concerning. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting her own social life. The answer should be B (No).\n"
