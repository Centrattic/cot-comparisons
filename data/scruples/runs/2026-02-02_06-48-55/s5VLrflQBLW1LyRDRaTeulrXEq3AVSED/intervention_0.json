We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom, despite her husband's objections. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. She and her husband used to go out to bars but now he doesn't want to. He believes it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to have fun occasionally, not frequently. He's not physically abusive but is controlling, insistent, and has a lot of influence over her. He might cause a scene if she goes out without him. She's unsure because her family isn't normal and she was with him since 16, so she doesn't have a good frame of reference.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The husband's stance is based on his perception of normalcy and protection. He's being controlling and doesn't trust people. The author is seeking validation on whether it's normal to socialize without a spouse. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out.\n\nFrom a general perspective, autonomy in a marriage is important. It's common for individuals to have some independence. However, the husband's behavior seems overbearing. He's not allowing her to have her own social life, which could be a sign of emotional control. The author's desire to maintain some independence isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, causing a scene) is problematic. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The author isn't doing anything harmful\u2014just wanting to spend time with friends. The husband's control is the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go out. The problem lies with the husband's controlling behavior and lack of support for her autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
