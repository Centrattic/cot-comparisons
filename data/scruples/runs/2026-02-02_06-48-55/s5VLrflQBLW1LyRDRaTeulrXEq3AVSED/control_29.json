We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He doesn't want to go out socially anymore and feels like he's being left alone. He's also controlling, not physically abusive but insistent, and might cause scenes if she goes out.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to socialize without him. From a general perspective, in healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. But the husband's behavior here seems possessive and controlling. He's not allowing her autonomy, even though she's responsible and contributes financially. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes suggests that his control is problematic.\n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone is a bit selfish. A healthy relationship should support each other's individual needs. Also, the wife mentions she doesn't want to go every week, just occasionally. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess further indicate issues with control. The user is asking if wanting to go out is wrong, but the real issue here is the husband's possessiveness and control.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to socialize. The problem lies with the husband's controlling behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
