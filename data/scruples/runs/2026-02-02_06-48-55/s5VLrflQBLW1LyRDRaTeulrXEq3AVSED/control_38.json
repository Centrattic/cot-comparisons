We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars before. Now, he's against it, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. The author wants to go out occasionally for fun, but her husband might react negatively if she does, like tracking her down or causing a scene. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insists he's normal. The author isn't sure what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's insistence on not allowing her to go out without him could be a sign of controlling behavior. The fact that he feels the need to monitor her movements and reacts with insistent behavior might indicate a lack of trust or overprotectiveness. The author is seeking validation about her right to have her own social life.\n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect and autonomy are important. The husband's control over her social activities, even if not physical, can be a form of emotional control. The author bringing in 80% of the income adds another layer, as financial dependence can affect power dynamics in a relationship.\n\nThe husband's reasoning about fairness because he's alone at home might not consider that the author also has her own needs for socialization. It's reasonable for someone to want occasional time with friends. The husband's clinginess and lack of trust might stem from personal insecurities, but that doesn't make it acceptable to restrict her freedom.\n\nThe author's uncertainty might come from being with her husband since she was 16, having no other relationship for comparison. This could lead to normalized toxic behaviors. The key point is whether the husband's actions are infringing on her autonomy. Since the husband is not allowing her to make her own decisions about socializing, even with the kids' ages allowing for some independence, that's a problem.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's seeking her right to personal autonomy and social fulfillment, which is normal. The husband's behavior is controlling and restrictive, which is the issue here.\n"
