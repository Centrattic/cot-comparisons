  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to go out with my friends even though Im a married mom?\nI (f 34) have been married to hubby (m 38) for 15 years. We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's been controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. He's not physically abusive but might cause a scene or keep her up all night if she goes out. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. But the user is a responsible parent, brings in 80% of the family income, and just wants to have some social time. His control over her and lack of trust might be issues. The fact that they were together since she was 16 and she doesn't have a normal family background could mean she's in an enmeshed or controlling relationship without realizing it.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have their own social lives. It's normal and healthy for individuals to maintain independence. The husband's insistence on controlling her outings and not trusting others could be signs of possessiveness or insecurity. The user isn't asking for weekly outings but just occasional fun. The husband's potential to cause a scene or disrupt her when she goes out is a red flag, indicating possible emotional control.\n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for wanting personal freedom. The real issue is the husband's controlling behavior and lack of trust. She's seeking validation that her desire for autonomy is normal. So, the answer should be that she's not in the wrong. The problem lies with the husband's behavior, not her wanting to socialize.\n"
