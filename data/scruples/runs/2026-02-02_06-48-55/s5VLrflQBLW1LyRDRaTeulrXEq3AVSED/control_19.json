We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author, a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, used to go to bars with her husband when they were younger, but now her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The author wants to do something fun occasionally, not frequently. She mentions that her husband takes her on weekly dinner dates but is insistent about not going out alone. He's not physically abusive but is controlling, insists he's protecting her, and doesn't trust others. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's been married for 15 years, and they've been together since she was 16. That long-term relationship might make it harder for her to evaluate normality. His reasoning is that it's unfair for him to stay home alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse. However, wanting to socialize with friends is a common need. The author is responsible, brings in most of the income, and just wants some autonomy.\n\nControl issues are a red flag here. The husband's insistence on tracking her down, causing a scene, or keeping her up arguing when she goes out suggests he's not respecting her independence. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control can be harmful. The author's uncertainty might stem from his convincing arguments and her lack of comparison due to her family background.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many married people do go out with friends without their spouses. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess could be signs of insecurity or possessiveness. The author's desire for personal time isn't unreasonable. She's not asking for frequent outings but occasional ones, which is normal for maintaining her own social life and mental health.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking balance and autonomy in her marriage. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not her desire to socialize. So the answer should be B.\n"
