We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband doesn't want her to go out with friends, even though they both don't have alcohol issues. She wants some social time, maybe once in a while. The husband is against it, says it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. He's controlling, insistent, and might cause scenes if she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is the husband's control over her social life. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out. Generally, in a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and possibly possessive. He's not physically abusive but uses emotional control, tracking her down, causing arguments. That's red flags for emotional abuse or at least an unhealthy dynamic.\n\nThe author mentions she's unsure because her husband has been convincing and they've been together since she was 16. She might have low self-esteem or be used to his control. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy adds to the problem. She's contributing 80% of the income, which might be another point, but her right to socialize shouldn't depend on financial contribution.\n\nNormal socializing for adults is important for mental health. The husband's stance against it, without valid reasons (since they aren't dealing with addiction), seems unreasonable. The author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally. The husband's reaction (cause a scene, keep her up all night) indicates he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She has a right to socialize, and the husband's behavior is problematic. The key is the control and lack of respect for her needs. The community would likely side with her needing to have some independence.\n"
