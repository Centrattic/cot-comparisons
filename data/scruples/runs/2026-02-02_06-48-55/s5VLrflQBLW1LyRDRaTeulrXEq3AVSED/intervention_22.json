We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the married woman (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The husband has been controlling and doesn't allow her to socialize outside their family or his presence. He's been this way for ten years, and she feels it's time to have some fun again. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband is described as having a lot of control, not trusting others, and being clingy. He doesn't physically abuse her but uses emotional control, possibly through guilt-tripping or convincing her that his way is the only normal way. The author mentions she's been with him since 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for healthy relationships.\n\nThe key points are: she wants to socialize, he's restricting her, they have four kids, and the husband's reasoning is about fairness and protecting her. The author is responsible, contributes 80% of the income, and the husband is insistent on his views of normalcy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for married individuals to have friends and social lives outside the marriage. The husband's behavior seems controlling and possibly overbearing. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control can be a form of abuse.\n\nThe author's desire to have fun and socialize isn't unreasonable. It's important for her mental health and well-being to have her own space. The husband's insistence on controlling her social interactions could be a red flag for a controlling or even abusive relationship. The fact that she's unsure because her family background isn't normal and she's been with him since 16 suggests she might not recognize the unhealthy aspects of their relationship.\n\nIn many cases, a healthy marriage allows both partners to have independent social lives. The husband's behavior is limiting her autonomy and could be affecting her self-esteem. The answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong because she's seeking a normal level of social interaction, which is her right. The husband is the one maintaining a controlling environment.\n"
