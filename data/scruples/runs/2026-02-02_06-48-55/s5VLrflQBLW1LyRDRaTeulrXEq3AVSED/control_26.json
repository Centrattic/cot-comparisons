We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (a married mom who wants to go out with friends) is in the wrong. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him and might react strongly if she does. Let me unpack this.\n\nFirst, the woman is 34, married for 15 years, has four kids. They used to go out more when younger, but now the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He says it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The husband is controlling, insistent, and she's unsure if he's right because of her upbringing. She brings in 80% of the income, wants to do something fun occasionally, but he's clingy and might cause a scene if she goes out.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal autonomy and social norms. The husband's stance is that a married woman shouldn't go out without her husband. That's a traditional view, but times have changed. In many modern relationships, it's common for partners to have their own social lives. The husband's behavior sounds controlling. He's not physically abusive but exerts control through insistence and making her feel guilty. He might isolate her socially, which is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nThe woman is seeking validation on whether wanting to socialize is normal. The husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal is questionable. Wanting to have friends and some independence is normal in a healthy relationship. The fact that he's been controlling since she was 16 (they've been together since she was 16) suggests a long-standing power dynamic. She might be in an emotionally abusive situation where he's limiting her freedom.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) question here is whether she's wrong to want to go out. From a modern perspective, she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is restrictive and controlling, which is unhealthy. The woman has a right to her own social life. The answer would be B (not in the wrong). The husband's insistence on control and lack of trust in her or others is the issue here.\n"
