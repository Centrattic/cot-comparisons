We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that she's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to socialize without him. He feels it's not appropriate and might react strongly if she goes. She brings in 80% of the income and wants some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal freedom and relationship dynamics. The husband controls her socializing, which might be a sign of controlling behavior. Even though he's not physically abusive, his insistence on her not going out and his possible reactions (tracking her, causing a scene) could indicate emotional control. \n\nThe author is seeking validation on whether her desire for social time is normal. In healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's reasoning about not being fair for him to be alone and his belief about married women's socializing might stem from his insecurities or lack of trust. However, controlling behavior isn't healthy. The fact that she's responsible for most of the family's income adds another layer, but that shouldn't restrict her personal time. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since wanting to spend time with friends is a normal part of self-care and maintaining social health, she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
