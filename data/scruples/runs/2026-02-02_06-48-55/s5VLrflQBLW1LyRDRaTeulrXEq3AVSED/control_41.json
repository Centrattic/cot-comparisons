We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, and she wants to go out with her friends sometimes. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not against her going out every week, just once in a while. The husband's reasoning is that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband and that he doesn't want to be alone. He's also described as controlling and insistent, not physically abusive but emotionally controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal autonomy in a marriage. The author is seeking the right to have her own social life, which is a common issue in long-term relationships. The husband's side is about his discomfort and control, but the author is asking if wanting personal time is acceptable.\n\nIn many relationships, it's normal for partners to have separate interests and social circles. The fact that the husband is resistant to this, especially given his controlling behavior, might indicate a problem in the relationship. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014like going out every week\u2014but just occasionally. The husband's reaction, like possibly causing a scene or keeping her up discussing it, suggests he might be overstepping, especially if he's not abusive but still exerting control.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the husband has a lot of control over her and can be clingy. This dynamic might be affecting her autonomy. Even if he's not abusive, controlling behavior can still be problematic. The author's desire to maintain some independence is valid. The fact that she's a working parent, bringing in most of the income, adds another layer where she might need personal time to decompress.\n\nThe question is whether her wanting to go out is in the wrong. Considering societal norms, it's generally accepted that spouses can have their own social lives. The issue here seems more about the husband's control and his feelings of insecurity rather than the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life, even if it's just occasionally.\n"
