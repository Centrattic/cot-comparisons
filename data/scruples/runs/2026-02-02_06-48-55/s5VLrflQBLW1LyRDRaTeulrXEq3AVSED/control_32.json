We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The scenario is that she's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. He's not physically abusive but has control issues and is clingy. She brings in 80% of the family income and feels she deserves some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her wanting to socialize is unreasonable. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse. However, the author is asking if her desire is valid.\n\nIn modern relationships, it's generally accepted that both partners should have their own social lives. Marriage doesn't mean one should completely lose their independence. The husband's control over her decisions and his insistence on being the norm might be a red flag. His behavior sounds possessive and possibly emotionally controlling, even if not physically abusive.\n\nThe author brings in most of the income, which shows she's a significant contributor to the family, so her autonomy is important. The husband's reactions\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, keeping her up all night\u2014indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. Even if they've been together since she was 16, that doesn't justify his controlling behavior. \n\nHer uncertainty about whether he's right might stem from his convincing nature and lack of a normal family background. However, healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's independence. The key point is that the husband is not allowing her to have her own social life, which can lead to resentment and unhappiness. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to her own social time, and her husband's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
