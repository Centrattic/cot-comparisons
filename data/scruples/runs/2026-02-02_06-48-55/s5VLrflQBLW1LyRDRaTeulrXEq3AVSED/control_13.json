We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, wanting to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband doesn't approve, feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him, and she's worried he might cause a scene if she goes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's argument is based on his perception of normalcy and protecting her, but he's being controlling. He doesn't allow her to go out even once in a while, which is affecting her social life. The author is responsible financially and wants some independence. The husband's behavior includes controlling actions, lack of trust, and clinginess. He's not physically abusive but uses emotional control. The author is unsure because she's been with him since 16 and has no other reference.\n\nIn terms of normalcy in marriage, it's generally accepted that both partners should have some independence. Socializing with friends is a basic need for many people. The husband's restrictions seem excessive and controlling, especially since they don't involve alcohol and are infrequent. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author isn't doing anything harmful; she's seeking balance and personal time. The husband's insistence on being right and not trusting others also points to his controlling nature.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking a normal level of social interaction, which is important for her well-being. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
