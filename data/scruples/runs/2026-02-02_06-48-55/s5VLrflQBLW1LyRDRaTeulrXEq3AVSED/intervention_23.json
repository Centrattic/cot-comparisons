We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her going out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The woman feels she should have some independence, brings in most of the income, and just wants to do something fun occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a healthy marriage. Healthy relationships should allow both partners to have some social life and independence. The husband's behavior seems controlling, especially with the potential for causing a scene or making her come home if she goes out. That's not healthy. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy might stem from insecurity, but it's still problematic.\n\nThe woman is asking if it's normal for a married person to socialize without their spouse. Generally, yes, it's normal. People need personal space and friendships. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might be more about his own feelings rather than her right to socialize. Also, she's responsible and contributes to the family income, which supports her need for independence.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the information, the husband's behavior is the issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking social time. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points here are about mutual respect, autonomy in a relationship, and the husband's controlling tendencies.\n"
