We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a married woman wanting to go out with friends, but her husband doesn't want her to. They've been married 15 years, have four kids. She brings in most of the income. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, says it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and clingy. She feels he's being insistent and might cause scenes if she goes out.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user is asking for input on what's normal regarding socializing without a spouse. The key points here are about personal autonomy, the husband's control, and societal norms.\n\nIn many modern relationships, it's normal for partners to have social lives independently. The husband's stance that it's not appropriate for her to go out without him seems controlling. He's also not allowing her to have her own space, which can be a sign of an unhealthy dynamic. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even if he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag.\n\nShe mentions not having a normal family background and being with him since 16, which might mean she's never had a model for a healthy relationship. Her husband's insistence on protecting her might be overprotectiveness, but it's preventing her from having her own social life. Since she's contributing significantly to the family income, it's important she has her own time and space.\n\nThe husband's behavior could be considered emotionally controlling. The woman has a right to her own social interactions. The fact that the husband doesn't trust people and is clingy adds to the issue. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to socialize. The answer should be B.\n"
