We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. The author details a 15-year marriage with four kids. The main issue is the husband's belief that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him, leading to control and insistence on his views.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior includes controlling tendencies. He doesn't allow her to socialize outside his presence, even though she's responsible and contributes financially. His arguments are about fairness and normalcy, but his actions\u2014like threatening to track her down or cause a scene\u2014suggest emotional control, not just differing opinions on socializing. The author mentions he's clingy and doesn't trust people, which adds to the controlling aspect.\n\nThe author's desire to have some independence and socialize is reasonable. The husband's reaction isn't based on mutual respect but on wanting control. The fact that the author has been with him since she was 16 might mean she's unaware of healthier relationship dynamics. The question is whether her wanting to go out is wrong. Since the husband is the one exerting control and the author is seeking a normal balance, she isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more with his controlling behavior than her wanting to socialize.\n"
