We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. They've been married for 15 years. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they both aren't alcoholics. She wants to have some fun once in a while. The husband says it's unfair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. He controls her a lot, is clingy, and not trusting of others. The author is responsible for 80%+ of the income. If she goes out, he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up all night discussing it. He's not physically abusive but has a lot of control. She's been with him since 16 and doesn't know what normal is because of her family background.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the husband's control over her social life. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting time with friends. \n\nFrom a general perspective, in most relationships, both partners should have some autonomy and personal space. It's normal for people to have friends and social activities outside the relationship. The husband's belief that a married woman shouldn't go out without her husband seems restrictive and controlling. His actions of potentially tracking her or causing a scene if she goes out are signs of overstepping boundaries. The fact that he doesn't trust others and is clingy adds to the controlling behavior. \n\nThe author's intent is to have occasional fun, not to abandon her family. The husband's reasoning that it's unfair for him to sit home alone doesn't justify controlling her social life. Healthy relationships allow for individual freedom and mutual respect. The fact that the author is bringing in most of the income might also highlight the imbalance, as she's contributing significantly but has limited autonomy. \n\nThe husband's insistence on being \"normal\" is subjective. What's normal can vary, but controlling behavior is generally not considered healthy. The author's desire to have time with friends is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life, especially with the husband's controlling tendencies.\n"
