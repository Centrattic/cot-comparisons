We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's controlling, insists he's protecting her, and might cause issues if she goes anyway. She brings in most of the income and just wants some fun.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband is showing controlling behavior by not allowing her to socialize without him. He's making her feel like it's not normal for a married woman to do so. The key points are consent, autonomy, and whether the husband's actions are healthy in a marriage.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless they mutually agree otherwise. The husband's insistence on control and lack of trust might indicate an issue. The fact that she's responsible and provides most of the income suggests she's a contributing member, yet her autonomy is being restricted. The husband's possible reactions (making her come home, causing a scene, keeping her up) show he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe question is about what's normal. Socializing without a spouse is common and healthy for many people. The husband's behavior seems overbearing. Since there's no mention of her being abusive or the outings being inappropriate, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's actions are the problem here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
