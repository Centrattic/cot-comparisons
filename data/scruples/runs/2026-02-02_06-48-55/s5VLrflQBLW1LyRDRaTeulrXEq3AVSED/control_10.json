We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar together before. Now, he's against it and feels it's not appropriate. The author wants to have some fun occasionally but faces resistance and possible control issues from her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is controlling and insists on being with her, which might be a red flag. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. The author brings in most of the family income, which could indicate she's a strong, independent person, but the husband's behavior is restrictive.\n\nMarriage should ideally allow both partners some independence. Socializing with friends is a normal part of life and mental health. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her husband seems outdated and controlling. The author's desire for personal time isn't unreasonable. Also, the husband's lack of trust and clinginess further supports the idea that he's overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's control, the author's need for personal freedom, and societal norms regarding marital autonomy. Since the husband is being controlling and not respecting her wishes, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking to maintain her own social life. The answer should be B.\n"
