We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the married woman (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from her situation. She's a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. They used to go out before, but the husband doesn't want to now. He's against her going out without him, even though she's responsible and brings in 80% of the income. The husband's reasoning includes not wanting to be alone, thinking it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband, and being protective. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insistent.\n\nThe author seems to feel that her husband has too much control and doesn't trust her. She's unsure because her family isn't normal and she's been with him since 16, so she doesn't have a frame of reference. She wants to know if her desire to socialize is normal.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI need to evaluate the dynamics here. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to their own social lives. The husband's insistence on controlling her social interactions could be a sign of controlling behavior. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes against his wishes is concerning. It suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe author isn't asking to go out frequently\u2014just occasionally for fun. Given that she's responsible and the husband doesn't have issues with alcoholism, there's no valid reason to restrict her. The husband's reasoning about it not being fair for him to sit alone doesn't justify controlling her. Also, the lack of trust and clinginess from him are red flags for a controlling partner.\n\nHer uncertainty might stem from being in a relationship without healthy boundaries for a long time. The fact that she's had to question her own desires because of her husband's influence is a sign that the relationship might be imbalanced. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that individuals in a marriage can have independent social lives. The husband's belief that a married woman shouldn't go out without her spouse is a traditional view that might not align with modern understandings of healthy relationships. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her desire to maintain some autonomy is valid. The husband's behavior is problematic, and the author is seeking validation for her needs. So the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
