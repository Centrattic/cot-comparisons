We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being married. The situation involves a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars together. Now he feels it's not appropriate, and she's responsible for 80% of the family income. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and might cause a scene if she goes out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's not physically abusive but is emotionally controlling, which can be a form of emotional abuse. He doesn't trust her and wants to control her social interactions. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 might indicate a long-standing power imbalance where she's unsure of what's normal.\n\nThe author wants to have some autonomy, which is a basic right in a healthy relationship. The husband's reasoning about fairness and normalcy is questionable. Socializing with friends without a spouse is common and healthy for many people. The husband's insistence that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him is outdated and restrictive. Also, the fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows his lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nThe author is contributing significantly to the family income, which further emphasizes her independence. Her husband's control over her social life could be a sign of a deeper issue in the relationship. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life, which is a reasonable desire. Since the husband's behavior is controlling and the author is seeking validation for her needs, it's likely she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
