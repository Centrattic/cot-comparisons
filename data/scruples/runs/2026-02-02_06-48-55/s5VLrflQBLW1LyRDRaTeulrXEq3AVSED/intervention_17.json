We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends but her husband doesn't want her to. The husband says it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him, even though he's not against going out when they were younger. He also mentions he's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent. The author is bringing in 80% of the income and just wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal autonomy in a marriage. The husband's behavior seems controlling and restrictive. He's not allowing her to socialize with friends, which is a basic need for many people. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out shows a lack of trust and respect for her autonomy. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasionally. \n\nThen, considering the husband's argument about it being \"not normal\" for a married woman to go out without her husband. That seems like a traditional or possibly outdated view. In most modern relationships, having some independence and social life outside the marriage is considered normal and healthy. The husband's insistence on control and his behavior might indicate emotional manipulation or an overprotective nature, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author mentions she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with her husband since she was 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for what a healthy relationship looks like. The fact that she's seeking input suggests she's aware there might be an issue. The husband's behavior could be part of a pattern of control, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. It's reasonable for her to seek some independence. The husband is the one whose behavior is problematic by not respecting her need for socializing and trying to control her actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
