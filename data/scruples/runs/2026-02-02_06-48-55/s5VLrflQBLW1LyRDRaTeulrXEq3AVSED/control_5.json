We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a married woman wanting to go out with friends, but her husband is against it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 34-year-old mother of four, married for 15 years. The husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go out before, but for the past ten years, he's not into it. The key points here are the husband's control over her social life, his insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him, and his potential reactions if she does go out. The author mentions he might track her down, cause a scene, or keep her up discussing it. Also, he's not physically abusive but has a lot of control and can be clingy and untrustful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal autonomy in marriage. Generally, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize with friends. The husband's behavior seems controlling, which is a red flag. The author is asking if it's normal for a married woman to go out without her husband, and the husband's reaction is extreme. The fact that he's been together since she was 16 and she doesn't have a reference for normal might mean she's in an unhealthy dynamic. \n\nThe husband's arguments about not wanting to be alone and his insistence on controlling her social life could indicate emotional manipulation or possessiveness. The author is seeking input on what's normal, so the community often supports the right to have a social life. Since the husband's behavior could escalate if she goes out, that suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's seeking balance and normalcy in her life, which is reasonable. The husband's actions are the issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
