We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to go out with friends even though she's a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, feels it's not appropriate, and might react strongly if she does. The author brings in most of the family income and wants some independence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband seems to have a lot of control and is insistent, even though they've been married since she was 16. That's a long time, so she might not have a lot of experience with relationships where she has freedom. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and normalcy, but he's also being very controlling. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The author is questioning if this is normal in a marriage.\n\nNow, the key points are about autonomy in a marriage. Do married individuals have the right to socialize without their spouse? Generally, yes. A healthy marriage should allow both partners some independence. The husband's reaction\u2014making her come home, causing a scene, keeping her up\u2014suggests a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even though they have kids and the husband spends time with her, his control over her social life is problematic.\n\nThe author is responsible for the family's finances, which adds another layer. She's contributing significantly but feels restricted. The husband's insistence that he's protecting her might be a way to justify his control. The author's uncertainty stems from not knowing what's normal, especially given her background. Comparing to her husband's behavior, it's more about his control rather than her wanting to socialize.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to have some social time. The issue is more on the husband's side for not allowing her independence and reacting negatively. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
