We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman. They used to go out before, but now he's against it. The wife wants to do something fun occasionally, not every week. The husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and wants to spend time together. However, he's controlling, doesn't trust people, is clingy, and might react strongly if she goes out anyway, like tracking her down or causing a scene. He's not physically abusive but has control issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are autonomy in marriage, social needs, and the husband's controlling behavior. The wife is a significant breadwinner (80% of income) and wants some independence. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But his behavior seems to be more about control and lack of trust, not just concern. The wife mentions he's convincing and she's unsure because she's been with him since 16 and has no other reference.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to have their own social lives. The husband's insistence on her not going out without him, along with the potential for causing a scene, seems controlling. The wife isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional. The fact that the husband is not physically abusive but uses emotional control is still a red flag. The author's desire for autonomy isn't unreasonable. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is problematic, and the wife's need for personal space is valid.\n"
