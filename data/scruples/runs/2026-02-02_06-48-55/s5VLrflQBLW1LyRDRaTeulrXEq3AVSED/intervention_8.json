We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a married mom with four kids, who wants to go out with friends. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him and feels it's not appropriate. He's been this way for ten years, not allowing her to have her own social time. He brings up control and insists it's for her protection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior includes controlling aspects, like not allowing her to go out, possibly tracking her if she goes against his wishes, and causing emotional distress. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a red flag. The fact that he's been this way for a decade and uses convincing arguments might be part of a pattern of emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author doesn't have a history of alcoholism, and neither does her husband, so that's not the issue. She's responsible and contributing financially. The main conflict is about social autonomy versus the husband's control. The kids are aged 7-17, but the issue here is about her personal freedom, not child custody or care.\n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the right to socialize independently. The husband's actions suggest a lack of trust and a need for control, which can be harmful to the relationship. The author's desire to have fun once in a while is reasonable. The question is whether her wanting to go out is in the wrong. The husband's control might be the real issue here, not her desire for social time.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. But considering the controlling behavior and the lack of socializing, the problem seems to stem from the husband's side. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking personal time. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The key points are the husband's control and the author's right to autonomy.\n"
