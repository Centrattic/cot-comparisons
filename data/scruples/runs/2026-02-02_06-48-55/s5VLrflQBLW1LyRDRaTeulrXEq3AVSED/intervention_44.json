We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (a married mom) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends. The situation involves her husband not wanting her to go out without him, even though they both don't have alcohol issues. He's been insistent for the past ten years, and she feels controlled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and used to go out more when they were younger. Now her husband doesn't want her to go out socially, not even occasionally. He argues it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not appropriate. She brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate she's the primary earner but also has responsibilities. She mentions he's controlling, not physically abusive but emotionally so, and she's unsure of normal social dynamics because of her own family background.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFrom a general societal perspective, having some independence and social life is important for a healthy marriage. It's common for people to have friends and go out occasionally without their spouse. The husband's behavior sounds controlling and possibly smothering, especially if he's pressuring her not to go out and might make her come home if she does. His lack of trust and clinginess could be signs of possessiveness or jealousy, which are not healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe fact that she brings in most of the income might also play into her desire for autonomy. If she's the main provider, she might feel she needs personal time to recharge, which can affect her well-being and family dynamics. The husband's insistence on being with her all the time might be a form of control, especially since they've been together since she was 16, so she might not have a frame of reference for healthy boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that mutual respect and communication are key. If they've been in a long-term relationship, maybe they have certain expectations. But in most cases, healthy relationships allow both partners some independence. The husband's reaction to her going out (tracking her down, causing scenes) is problematic. It's not normal for a spouse to exert that kind of control.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life. Her husband's behavior is more concerning. The answer should be B.\n"
