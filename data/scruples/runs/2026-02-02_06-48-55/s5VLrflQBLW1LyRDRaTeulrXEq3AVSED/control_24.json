We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married mom of four who wants to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. He's not physically abusive but is controlling and insistent. She's responsible for most of the family income.\n\nFirst, the key issue is autonomy in marriage. The right to have social life is generally considered a normal part of a healthy relationship. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse seems restrictive. The fact that he may cause a scene or keep her up all night if she goes against his wishes indicates controlling behavior. \n\nAlso, the user mentions he's been clingy and doesn't trust people, which might stem from his own insecurities. However, that doesn't justify controlling her. The user is trying to maintain some independence, which is valid. The fact that she's unsure due to her upbringing and lack of comparison shows she's in a situation where her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's need for personal space and social interactions. The husband's behavior seems to infringe on her personal freedom, which is a red flag. The user isn't doing anything unreasonable by wanting to spend time with friends. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
