We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to bars before. He feels it's not appropriate and might react strongly if she goes. The wife wants some fun once in a while, not frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is being controlling, not physically abusive but very insistent. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The wife is responsible for most of the income and is seeking some independence. The husband's reasoning is about fairness and normalcy, but his behavior seems to be about control.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's control over her, lack of trust, potential emotional manipulation, and her right to socialize. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have autonomy. The husband's reaction\u2014tracking her down, causing scenes, keeping her up\u2014shows he's not respecting her needs, which is a red flag.\n\nThe wife's background of coming from a non-normal family and being with him since 16 might make her question her own needs. But she's seeking validation here. The question is about socializing without the spouse. Socializing is normal and healthy, especially for a parent to have personal time.\n\nPossible issues: The husband's control might be emotionally abusive. The wife deserves to have her own social life. The husband's insistence on \"protecting\" her could be a way to maintain control. The fact that he's not physically abusive is a point, but emotional control is still problematic.\n\nSo, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. She's seeking balance and normal social interaction, which is healthy. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
