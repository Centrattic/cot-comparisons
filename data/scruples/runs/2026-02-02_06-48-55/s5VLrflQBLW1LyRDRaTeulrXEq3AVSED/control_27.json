We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's a 34-year-old married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's inappropriate for a married woman. He gets controlling, might track her or cause a scene if she goes. She's responsible, brings in 80% of the income, and wants some social time. They used to go out before, but he's been resistant for ten years now. He's clingy, controlling, and she's unsure because of her family background.\n\nSo, the main issue is the husband's controlling behavior and lack of trust. The question is about socializing without a spouse. Generally, in healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy and the right to socialize. The husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014controlling, not trusting her, and using emotional manipulation. The fact that he's not physically abusive but still exerts control is a red flag. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional. Her wanting independence isn't wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. The community usually sides against controlling behavior. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
