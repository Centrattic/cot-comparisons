We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom. The scenario involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The wife wants some fun once in a while, not regularly. The husband is controlling, not physically abusive but very insistent, and doesn't trust people. She's unsure if his reasoning is right because her family isn't normal, and she's been with him since she was 16.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems controlling. He's not allowing her to have social time without him, even though she's responsible and contributes financially. The key points are his insistence on control, lack of trust, and the fact that she's being denied autonomy. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's reasoning about it not being fair for him to be alone might be his way of justifying control rather than a genuine concern for her. The fact that he might cause a scene or keep her up all night if she goes shows he's not respecting her autonomy. The wife's need for personal space and social interaction is valid. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is problematic.\n"
