We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a married woman with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He gets upset about it, possibly causing scenes or keeping her up at night. He's controlling and insistent, even though he's not physically abusive. The author is unsure because she doesn't know what's normal, especially since her own family isn't normal.\n\nFirst, the key points here are her desire for personal freedom and socializing, versus her husband's control and lack of trust. The husband's behavior sounds a bit possessive. He doesn't trust people, is clingy, and wants to control her social interactions. Even though he's not violent, his insistence on being present for all her social activities and his potential reactions (tracking her down, causing a scene) are signs of controlling behavior.\n\nThe author mentions she wants to do something fun once in a while, which is reasonable. The husband's reasoning about it being unfair for him to sit home alone is a bit self-centered. It's normal for married people to have friends and social lives outside of their spouse. The husband's control over her and his need to protect her from situations might be overstepping. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and she's been with him since 16 suggests she might have grown up in an environment where this was the norm, making it hard to recognize it as controlling.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it varies, most would agree that a healthy marriage allows both partners some independence. The author isn't asking for frequent outings, just occasional ones. The husband's reaction (tracking her, causing scenes) is problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting this independence. The answer likely hinges on whether the husband's behavior is controlling and if her desire for social time is reasonable.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking a normal level of autonomy, and her husband's behavior is the issue here. The answer would be B.\n"
