We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids, wanting to go out with friends occasionally. Her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though he's not against going out socially in the past. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the husband's control over the author's social life, his insistence on being with her, and the possibility of causing a scene or keeping her up at night if she goes out. The author brings in 80% of the family income, which might indicate she's a strong contributor, yet she's restricted in her social activities.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems possessive and controlling. He's been with her since she was 16, which might have led to her not having a frame of reference for healthy relationships. The fact that he doesn't trust people and is clingy points to possible emotional control. The author's desire to socialize is reasonable; everyone needs some personal time. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, causing a scene) is red flag behavior, even if not physically abusive.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but considering the dynamics, the husband's control is the main issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to maintain her independence and social connections. The husband's actions are more concerning as they could be signs of emotional manipulation or control. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
