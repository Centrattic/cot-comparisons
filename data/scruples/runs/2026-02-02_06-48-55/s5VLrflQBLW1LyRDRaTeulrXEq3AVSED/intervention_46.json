We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. He's not physically abusive, but he has a lot of control and can be clingy. She's been with him since she was 16, which might affect her perception of normal relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, using reasons like fairness and protecting her. The author argues that she's responsible, contributes financially, and just wants some fun. The husband's behavior includes tracking her down, causing scenes, or keeping her up if she goes out against his wishes. That sounds controlling. \n\nControl in a relationship is a red flag. Even if he's not physically abusive, emotional control and lack of trust can be detrimental. The fact that he's been with her since she was 16 might mean she's been in the relationship for a long time without knowing other dynamics, making it hard to assess what's normal. Socializing with friends is a basic need for many people, contributing to well-being. The husband's insistence on controlling her social time might be overstepping. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Why? Maybe they think she should accommodate her husband's feelings. But in reality, mutual respect and autonomy are important in a healthy marriage. The husband's behavior seems restrictive, and the author deserves to have her own social life. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics of control, the impact on the author's mental health, and the fact that socializing is a reasonable request, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
