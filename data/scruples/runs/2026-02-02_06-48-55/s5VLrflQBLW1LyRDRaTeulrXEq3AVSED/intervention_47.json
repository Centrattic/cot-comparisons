We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a married woman wanting to go out with friends, but her husband doesn't allow it. She used to go out with him before, but now he doesn't want to. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, and she's not sure if his behavior is normal because of her upbringing.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to go out. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate based on typical social norms and relationship dynamics. \n\nThe husband's argument is that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. However, the woman is an adult, contributes significantly to the household income, and wants some social time. It seems like the husband is being controlling and not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn many cultures, especially in modern times, it's considered normal for individuals in a marriage to have their own social lives. The husband's insistence on controlling her outings, even if not physically abusive, can be seen as emotional control. The fact that he might cause a scene or make her come home if she goes out is a red flag for controlling behavior. \n\nThe woman's need for social interaction is valid. Having friends and personal time is important for mental health. The husband's lack of trust and clinginess might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't justify his controlling actions. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the information, the husband's behavior is more problematic. The woman is seeking validation for her desire to maintain independence, which is normal. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
