We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being married. The author is a married woman with four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go out before. Now he's against it, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insists he's just protecting her. The author brings in most of the family income and wants some social time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: the balance between a spouse's autonomy and a partner's concerns. The husband's stance is that he doesn't want her to go out alone or without him, and he feels it's unfair for him to be alone. He's been married for 15 years, so they've been together a long time. The author is unsure if his reasoning is normal, especially given her family background and lack of comparison.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's control is reasonable. The author is asking if she's the asshole for wanting to go out. The husband's behavior\u2014being insistent, not trusting people, being clingy\u2014could indicate emotional control. Even if he's not violent, controlling someone's social life can be a form of emotional abuse. The author is seeking validation on what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing, which suggests she feels restricted.\n\nThe husband's argument that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse is problematic. It's not inherently normal to prevent someone from having their own social life. Healthy relationships allow both partners independence. The fact that the husband might track her down or cause a scene if she goes against his wishes shows he's trying to control her actions, which is a red flag. The author's bringing in 80% of the income also adds complexity, as it might be used as leverage in some way, but it's not directly about money here.\n\nThe author's uncertainty stems from being with her husband since 16 and coming from an abnormal family, making it hard to compare. She might feel trapped, not knowing what's normal. The husband's insistence that he's protecting her could be a way to maintain control. Allowing each other some independence is usually healthy in a marriage. The author isn't asking to go out often\u2014just occasionally for fun. Denying that would be stifling her autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more problematic. The author is seeking her right to socialize, which is reasonable. Therefore, the correct answer would be B.\n"
