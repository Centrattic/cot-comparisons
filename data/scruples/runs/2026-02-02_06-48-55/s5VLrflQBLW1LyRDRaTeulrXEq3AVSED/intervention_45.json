We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate. The author feels controlled and wants some personal time. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband isn't physically abusive but is controlling, has trust issues, and doesn't trust people. He's been clingy and has a lot of control, which might indicate emotional manipulation. The author works and brings in 80% of the income, so she's contributing significantly. She's been with him since she was 16, so maybe she's not sure what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nIn terms of social norms, most people would agree that a spouse should have some independence. The husband's insistence on being with her all the time and not allowing her to go out with friends could be seen as overstepping. The fact that he might cause a scene or not let her sleep if she goes out without him is concerning. Healthy relationships allow for individuality and personal time.\n\nThe author's desire to have some fun isn't unreasonable. It's normal for people to want social interactions beyond their immediate family or partner. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might not justify controlling her actions. Trust and mutual respect are crucial in a marriage. If the husband can't trust her or respect her need for social time, that's a problem on his end.\n\nHowever, the author might feel conflicted because she's been with him since a young age and doesn't have a reference for healthy relationships. The husband's convincing nature could be making her doubt her own needs. But ultimately, the right to have personal time and socialize is a basic need. The husband's behavior seems to border on controlling, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go out. The husband's behavior is the issue here. She's seeking balance in her life, which is reasonable. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
