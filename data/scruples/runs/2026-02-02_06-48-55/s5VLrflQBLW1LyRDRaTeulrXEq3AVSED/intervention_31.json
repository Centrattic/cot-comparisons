We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a married woman with four kids. They've been married for 15 years. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar together. The husband argues it's not appropriate and that he shouldn't be left alone. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling and insistent that his way is correct. The author feels she's responsible and brings in 80% of the income, but she wants to have some fun with friends occasionally. She's also from a non-normal family and has been with her husband since she was 16, so she's unsure what's normal.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy in marriage, socializing, and the husband's controlling behavior. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize, provided they communicate and respect each other's boundaries. The husband's insistence that a married woman shouldn't go out without him sounds controlling and possibly possessive. His behavior\u2014like threatening to track her down or cause a scene\u2014indicates a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nThe author's desire to go out with friends is reasonable. She's not asking to go every week; just occasionally. The husband's reasoning about it being unfair for him to be alone seems selfish. He already has family time and weekly dates, so maybe he's not considering her need for independent socialization. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's controlling and doesn't trust others might be signs of deeper issues, like insecurity or jealousy. The author mentioning she has nothing to compare and that he's convincing adds to the concern that she might be in an unhealthy dynamic. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's concerns come from a place of wanting to protect her. But given his controlling behavior, it's more about control than protection. The author isn't doing anything harmful; she's seeking normal social interactions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. The husband's reaction is more indicative of a problem in the marriage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
