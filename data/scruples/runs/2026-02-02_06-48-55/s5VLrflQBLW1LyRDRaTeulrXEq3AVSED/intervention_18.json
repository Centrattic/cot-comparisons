We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the married woman) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. She's a married mom with four kids, and they've been married for 15 years. They used to go out to bars before, but now her husband doesn't want to go out socially and thinks it's inappropriate for a married woman to go without him. The husband isn't an alcoholic, but he's being controlling, not allowing her to socialize. He might cause scenes or keep her up if she goes out against his wishes. She's responsible for most of the family's income and feels controlled. She's been with him since she was 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference for healthy relationships.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy in a marriage. The woman is seeking to maintain her own social life, which is a common aspect of a healthy relationship where both partners have their own space. The husband's behavior seems to restrict her freedom, which could be a sign of control issues. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control and lack of trust can be problematic. \n\nThe woman isn't asking to go out every week, just occasionally. The husband's reasons are based on his feelings of fairness and his perception of normalcy, but they don't seem to consider her individual needs. In a balanced relationship, both partners should support each other's independence. The husband's response of potentially causing a scene or disrupting her when she goes out is manipulative and controlling.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's reasonable for her to want her own social time. The husband's behavior is the issue here, as it's limiting her autonomy. Healthy relationships allow both people to have separate interests and friends. The fact that she's bringing in most of the income might also be a factor, but that's not directly related to her right to socialize. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
