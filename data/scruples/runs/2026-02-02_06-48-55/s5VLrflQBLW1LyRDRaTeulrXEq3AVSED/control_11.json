We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a married woman in her 30s with four kids, married for 15 years. She wants to go out with her friends occasionally, but her husband refuses to go out and also doesn't want her to go without him. He feels it's inappropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The husband doesn't want her to go out, even if she's just having a casual drink or dinner with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her husband's behavior is controlling. The user mentions that he can be very insistent, has control over her, and doesn't trust people. He might track her down or cause a scene if she goes anyway. That sounds like emotional control or maybe even emotional abuse. The fact that he's been this way for 10 years and that she's been with him since she was 16 (so the entire duration of her adult life) might mean she's not sure what's normal. \n\nHer husband's reasoning is about fairness and normalcy, but his actions prevent her from having autonomy. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control is a form of abuse. The user is a responsible person who contributes significantly to the family income, which means she's contributing both financially and emotionally, yet her autonomy is being restricted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out. Socializing with friends is a normal part of adult life, especially for someone in a long-term marriage with kids. It's reasonable for her to want some personal time and social connections outside the family. The husband's stance seems to stem from possessiveness and lack of trust, which are red flags in a relationship. \n\nThe user isn't asking for frequent outings but just occasionally. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, making scenes, keeping her up) indicates that his control issues are affecting her autonomy. The fact that she's unsure because of her upbringing and lack of a normal family background might make her more susceptible to his control. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally accepted that individuals in a marriage should have some independence. The husband's refusal to allow her to go out without him is not typical and is more indicative of controlling behavior. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking a normal social life, which is her right.\n"
