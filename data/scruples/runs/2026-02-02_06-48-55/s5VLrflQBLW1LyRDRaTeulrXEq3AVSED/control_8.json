We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a married woman wanting to go out with friends, but her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. She brings up a few points: they have four kids, they used to go out before, now he's against it. He's not physically abusive but is controlling, doesn't trust people, and can be clingy. She's financially responsible and wants to socialize sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her wanting to go out is wrong. The question is about normal socializing in a marriage. Generally, in healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's behavior seems controlling, especially if he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out. That's a red flag. He's also being insistent about what's \"normal,\" but his lack of trust and control might be the issue here. The fact that they've been together since she was 16 might mean she's never had much independence, so her desire for some autonomy is understandable. \n\nThe husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is problematic. It's not the woman's responsibility to always be with him. Also, the husband's behavior\u2014being very insistent and trying to control her\u2014sounds like emotional manipulation. The key points here are the control, lack of trust, and the possible emotional abuse. The woman is not in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life. The husband's actions are the ones that are concerning. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
