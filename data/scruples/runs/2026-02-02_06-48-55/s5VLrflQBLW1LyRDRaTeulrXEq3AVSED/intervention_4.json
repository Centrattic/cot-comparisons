We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the married mom (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. She's been married for 15 years and has four kids. They used to go out to the bar regularly, but for the past ten years, her husband has stopped wanting to socialize. His main argument is that it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband and that he doesn't want to be alone. He's also described as having a lot of control, being insistent, and not trusting people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the marriage. The husband is being controlling and doesn't trust people, which could be a red flag. The fact that he's been this way for a decade and is making decisions about what's \"appropriate\" for her social life might indicate an issue with his boundaries and her autonomy. The author mentions she brings in 80% of the family income, which suggests she's the primary breadwinner, so her social needs might be important for her well-being.\n\nHowever, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they're considering the husband's perspective, especially if he's been consistent in his views. But the key points here are about the husband's controlling behavior. In a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a mutual agreement or specific reason (like safety or child responsibilities) that restricts it. The husband's insistence on her not going out without him, even once in a while, and the potential for causing a scene or keeping her up all night if she does, points to emotional control. The author's desire to spend time with friends is reasonable and normal. She's not being neglectful of her family since she still has weekly dinners with her husband and the kids. The husband's behavior seems to stem from jealousy or possessiveness, which is unacceptable. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking her own social time. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
