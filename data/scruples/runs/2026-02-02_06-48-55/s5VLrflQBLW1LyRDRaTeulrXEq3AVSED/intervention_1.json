We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar together before. Now he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The husband isn't physically abusive but has control issues and is very insistent. The author brings in 80% of the family income and just wants to socialize occasionally.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. So, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The husband's stance is that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him, and he wants to spend time with her. However, the author wants to have some independence and socialize with friends. The husband's behavior is controlling, even if not abusive, and he might cause a scene or not let her sleep if she goes out. \n\nMarriage norms can vary, but the main issue here is the husband's control. The author is a responsible adult who contributes financially. The husband's insistence on her not going out without him seems like emotional control, which isn't healthy. The fact that he's been this way for ten years and is clingy adds to the problem. The author's desire for a little freedom once in a while is reasonable. \n\nThe husband's reasoning about fairness (sitting alone) might be valid if they had a mutual agreement, but since the author wants to go out occasionally and he's resisting it, maybe the issue is his lack of trust and need for control. The author isn't being reckless; she's just seeking some personal time. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's within her rights to want social interaction. The husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
