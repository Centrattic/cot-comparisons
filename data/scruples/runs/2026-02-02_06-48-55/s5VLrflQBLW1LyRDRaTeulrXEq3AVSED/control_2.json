We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they've been married for 15 years. He's been controlling and insists it's not fair for him to be alone. The author feels like she needs some independence but is afraid of his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior sounds controlling. He's not physically abusive but uses emotional control, like tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out. That's a red flag. Also, he doesn't trust people and is clingy, which can stifle a person's autonomy. The author works and contributes significantly to the family income, so she likely has her own needs for social interaction.\n\nThe key points are the husband's controlling behavior versus the author's right to socialize. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have the freedom to have their own social lives unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's insistence that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him is problematic. Socializing with friends is a common need for many people, and the fact that the author wants to do it occasionally isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe husband's actions, like potentially causing a scene or keeping her up all night, indicate that he's not respecting her autonomy. Even though he takes her on dates, that's not a substitute for her having her own social time. The author's uncertainty comes from her background and the long-term relationship where she might have internalized his views. However, the core issue is her right to independence versus his control.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is the issue here. She's seeking a basic level of autonomy, which is normal in a healthy marriage. Therefore, the correct response is B.\n"
