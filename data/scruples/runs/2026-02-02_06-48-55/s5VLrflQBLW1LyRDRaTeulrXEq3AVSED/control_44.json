We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even once in a while, and he's been this way for ten years. They used to go out before, but now he's against it. The husband isn't physically abusive but is controlling and insistent on his views. The author brings in most of the family income and wants some fun time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether wanting to socialize outside the marriage is reasonable. In most societies, it's normal for married individuals to have friends and personal time. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone or that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her spouse seems restrictive. The key points are the husband's control and the author's right to personal autonomy.\n\nThe husband's behavior sounds controlling. He's not allowing her to have her own social life, which is a red flag. Even though he's not physically abusive, emotional control and clinginess can be problematic. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. The author's desire for occasional social time is reasonable, especially since she's contributing significantly to the family income. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Given that she's asking if it's normal to socialize without the spouse, but the husband is imposing his views, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
