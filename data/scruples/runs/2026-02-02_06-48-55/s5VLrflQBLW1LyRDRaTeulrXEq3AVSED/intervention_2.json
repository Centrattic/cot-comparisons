We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a married woman with four kids) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with her friends without her husband. The husband has been against it for the past ten years, and he feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. He's controlling and doesn't trust people, which makes it hard for her to decide.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around socializing in a marriage. It's common for people to have friends and social lives outside their marriage. The woman wants to do something fun occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and thinks it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. But that seems a bit possessive and controlling. He's also very insistent and could cause issues if she goes, like tracking her down or causing a scene. \n\nThe woman mentions that he controls her and is clingy. She's unsure because her family background isn't normal, and she's been with him since 16, so she might not have a good frame of reference. The key points here are autonomy, trust, and fairness in the relationship. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there are specific circumstances (like addiction, which isn't the case here). The husband's behavior sounds like emotional control, which isn't healthy. The woman bringing in 80% of the income is also a point; her independence is significant. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a right to her own social life. The husband's actions are more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
