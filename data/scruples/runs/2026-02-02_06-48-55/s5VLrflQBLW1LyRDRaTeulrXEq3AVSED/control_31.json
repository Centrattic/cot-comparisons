We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. Let me read through the details again.\n\nShe's married for 15 years, has four kids aged 7-17. They used to go to the bar regularly, but for the past ten years, her husband doesn't want to go out socially. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. She wants to do something fun occasionally, not frequently. He takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her in family settings. His reasoning is that it's unfair for him to be alone and he thinks it's not normal for a married woman to go out without her husband. He's controlling, insistent, and she's not sure if he's right because she doesn't have a normal family background. He's been with her since she was 16, so she doesn't have much to compare. He's not physically abusive but can cause scenes or keep her up arguing if she goes out.\n\nFirst, the key points here are her desire for personal autonomy and social life versus her husband's control and jealousy. The husband's stance seems to be based on traditional views about married women needing to be with their husbands. However, she's a parent with kids, and it's reasonable for her to want some personal time. \n\nIn modern relationships, it's considered healthy for individuals to maintain their own social lives. The husband's insistence on controlling her time could be a red flag, indicating a lack of trust and possible emotional control. The fact that he might cause a scene or make her life difficult if she goes out suggests he's not supportive of her autonomy. \n\nThe wife's argument is that she's responsible, contributes significantly to the income, and just wants some fun. The husband's control might stem from insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify his behavior. The fact that she's unsure because of her upbringing and his convincing nature shows that she might be in an emotionally manipulative relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the wife is not in the wrong for wanting to have her own social life. It's a reasonable expectation, and the husband's reaction is problematic. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
