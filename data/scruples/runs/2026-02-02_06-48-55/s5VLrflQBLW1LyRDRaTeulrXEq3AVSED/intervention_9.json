We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a married mom with four kids who wants to go out with friends but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate. The husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they used to go to bars together before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. The author brings in 80% of the family income and feels she should be able to have some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are the husband's controlling behavior, his lack of trust, and the author's desire for social interaction. The husband is making decisions for her, which is a sign of emotional control. He's also using the idea of what's \"normal\" for a married woman as a justification, which might be a way to limit her autonomy.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a specific reason (like safety or other agreements). The husband's insistence on not letting her go out with friends without him, especially when they're adults and she's responsible, seems controlling. The fact that he might cause a scene or keep her up all night if she goes against his wishes suggests that his reaction is more about his own insecurities or need for control rather than her safety.\n\nThe author's background is also mentioned\u2014she's been with her husband since 16 and doesn't know what a normal relationship looks like. This could mean she's been socially isolated for a long time and is now seeking independence, which is a natural desire. Her bringing in most of the income adds another layer, as financial dependence can affect her ability to assert her needs.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's common for couples to have separate social lives. The husband's stance against that might stem from traditional views or personal issues. The author isn't seeking to abandon her family, just to have occasional fun with friends. Her intention doesn't seem wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband's concerns are about protecting her, but given his controlling behavior, it's more about control than protection. The line between concern and control is thin, but the husband's actions (tracking her down, making scenes) cross into unhealthy territory.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's reaction is more indicative of a controlling nature rather than a valid concern for her. The answer should be B.\n"
