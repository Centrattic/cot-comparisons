We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. She wants to go out occasionally, but her husband doesn't think it's appropriate for a married woman to do so without him. They used to go out before, but for the past ten years, he's been against it. She mentions he's controlling and insistent, and he might cause a scene if she goes without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal freedom in a marriage and the husband's controlling behavior. The author wants to socialize, which is a normal and healthy activity. The husband's objections seem to stem from a place of control and lack of trust, not from any legitimate concern like safety or addiction, which they don't have. He's making her feel guilty for wanting her own social time, and there's a history of him being clingy and distrustful. The fact that the husband doesn't trust people and is very insistent could indicate emotional control. The author's situation might be an example of an emotionally controlling relationship, which is a red flag. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. The husband's refusal without valid reasons and potential reactions like tracking her down or making her come home suggest that his behavior is overstepping. The author isn't doing anything unreasonable by wanting to spend time with friends. The fact that she's the main breadwinner adds another layer, as it's not about financial dependency. The husband's behavior is more about control. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B, indicating she's not in the wrong.\n"
