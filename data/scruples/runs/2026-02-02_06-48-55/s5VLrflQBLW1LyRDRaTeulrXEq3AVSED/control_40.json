We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married woman wanting to go out with friends without her husband. She mentions that they've been married for 15 years, and the husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. The woman is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is controlling in a way, not physically abusive but insistent and possibly manipulative. He checks up on her, might track her down if she goes, and makes her come home. That seems like emotional control. He doesn't trust people and is clingy. The woman is responsible, brings in 80%+ of the income, and has four kids. She wants some social time, which is reasonable.\n\nThe husband's argument is about fairness and what's normal. But the key here is his control over her. If he's making her feel guilty or restricting her freedom without a valid reason, that's a problem. The question is whether wanting to socialize is normal and if the husband's objections are valid.\n\nIn many relationships, it's normal for partners to have separate social lives. The husband's insistence that she can't go out without him might be a sign of possessiveness or control issues. Also, the fact that he was like this since she was 16 and she doesn't know what's normal because of her family background complicates things. She might not have had the chance to develop her own sense of what's normal.\n\nThe husband's behavior, like tracking her down or causing scenes if she goes out, indicates that he's not respecting her autonomy. Even though he's trying to protect her, the method is controlling. The woman's request for social time is reasonable, and the husband's response is over the line.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asking for a normal part of life that's important for her well-being. The husband's reaction is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
