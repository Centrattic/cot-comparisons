We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a married woman with four kids who wants to go out with friends occasionally, but her husband doesn't want her to go out without him. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse. The author feels controlled and that her husband is clingy and doesn't trust people. She brings in most of the family income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems to stem from a place of wanting to protect and control, which might be a form of emotional manipulation. The author wants autonomy, which is a basic human need. The fact that the husband might cause scenes or keep her up at night if she goes out against his wishes indicates potential emotional abuse or coercive control. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the details, it seems more like the husband is the one being overcontrolling. Socializing with friends is a normal part of adult life, and the husband's insistence on controlling this aspect could be harmful to the author's well-being. The author's concern about not knowing what's normal because of her upbringing adds another layer, suggesting she might be in a situation where her autonomy is being suppressed.\n\nHowever, cultural or personal beliefs might influence the husband's perspective. But even so, respecting a partner's need for social interaction is important in a healthy relationship. The key points here are the husband's control, lack of trust, and potential for conflict if she goes against his wishes. The author isn't doing anything harmful by wanting to spend time with friends; the issue is the husband's overreach. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
