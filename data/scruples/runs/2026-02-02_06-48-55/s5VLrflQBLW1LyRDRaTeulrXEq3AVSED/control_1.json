We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. She's been married for 15 years, has four kids, and her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him. They used to go to the bar together, but now he feels it's not appropriate. She just wants to do something fun occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is being controlling, not physically abusive but insistent and maybe clingy. He doesn't trust others and wants her to spend time only with him or the family. The woman brings in 80% of the income, which might mean she's a strong, independent person, but she's been with him since she was 16, so maybe she's used to his ways and unsure of what's normal.\n\nThe key points are her desire for autonomy and his controlling behavior. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal. But in reality, it's common for couples to have separate social lives. The husband's behavior sounds like emotional control, making her feel guilty for wanting independence. She's looking for validation on whether her desire is okay.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer likely is no because wanting to maintain friendships and have some independence is normal. The husband's reaction\u2014threatening to track her down or cause a scene\u2014indicates he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that she's responsible and brings in most of the income suggests she's capable of handling herself. The husband's insistence on control is problematic, not her wanting to socialize. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
