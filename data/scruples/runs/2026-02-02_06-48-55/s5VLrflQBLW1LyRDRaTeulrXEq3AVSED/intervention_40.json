We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom, even though her husband doesn't agree. The author is 34, married for 15 years, has four kids. They used to go to the bar together when they were younger, but now the husband feels it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without him. The husband isn't physically abusive but has a lot of control and can be insistent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in a marriage regarding socializing. The author is seeking validation if her desire to have some autonomy is justified. The husband's stance is about not wanting to be alone and controlling his wife's social interactions. The author brings in 80% of the income, which might be a factor in her needing some personal time.\n\nThe husband's behavior sounds controlling and possibly possessive. Even if he's not abusive, being very insistent and not trusting people could indicate emotional control. The author is a mom, so balancing family and personal time is important. She wants to do something fun occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's argument that it's not normal for a married woman to socialize without him is a red flag. That belief might stem from outdated or controlling views about marriage roles.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should evaluate based on mutual respect and autonomy in a relationship. Healthy relationships allow both partners to have separate social lives. The husband's reaction (tracking her down, causing a scene, keeping her up) suggests he might not handle her independence well, which is a problem. The author's uncertainty comes from not having a normal family background and being with her husband since 16, which might have limited her understanding of healthy relationships.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her social life. The husband's behavior is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
