We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the married mom) is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends without her husband. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe woman is 34, married for 15 years, with four kids. They used to go out to bars when they were younger, but now her husband doesn't want to go out socially. He says it's not appropriate for a married woman to go out without her husband. She wants to go out occasionally for fun, once in a while. Her husband takes her on a weekly dinner date and spends time with her. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to be alone and that it's not normal. He's not physically abusive but has control issues, is very insistent, doesn't trust people, and is clingy. She's unsure if he's right because she comes from a non-normal family and has been with him since she was 16, so she doesn't have a comparison. She's asking if it's normal for a married woman to socialize without her spouse and if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband is controlling, not allowing her to have social time without him. He's been this way for ten years, and he's not physically abusive but has emotional control. The woman is bringing in 80% of the family income, which suggests she's financially independent. She wants some autonomy in her social life. The key here is whether wanting to have friends and go out occasionally is reasonable. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize. It's important for individuals to maintain their own identities and friendships. The husband's reasoning seems to stem from insecurity or control, not a valid concern for her well-being. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes shows a lack of trust and control issues. The woman's need for personal time isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The question is about societal norms and expectations. In modern relationships, it's generally accepted that both partners can have independent social lives. The husband's behavior is restrictive and possibly emotionally manipulative. The woman's desire to maintain her own social circle is valid. \n\nI should also consider cultural or traditional perspectives, but given that neither has alcohol issues and the husband's control is the main problem, the traditional view that a married woman shouldn't go out without her husband is outdated. The woman's request is minimal\u2014once in a while, not regularly. The husband's reaction is excessive. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to her own social life, and her husband's behavior is the issue here.\n"
