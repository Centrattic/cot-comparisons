We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to socialize with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though they've been married for 15 years. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and has a lot of control over her. The author brings in 80% of the family's income and wants to have some fun sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around married couples and personal freedom. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have their own social lives. The husband's reasoning that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him seems outdated and controlling. The fact that he might cause a scene or make her come home if she goes out is concerning. It shows he's not respecting her autonomy. The author isn't asking to go out frequently, just occasionally, which is reasonable. The husband's clinginess and lack of trust could be signs of deeper issues like insecurity or possessiveness. The author's background of not having a normal family might make her question the husband's behavior, but that shouldn't mean she has to follow his rules. The fact that he's been very convincing over the years adds to the control dynamic. So, in a balanced marriage, personal space and social interactions are important for each partner's well-being. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain some independence. The answer should be B.\n"
