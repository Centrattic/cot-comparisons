We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation is that the husband doesn't want her to go out without him, even though she brings in 80% of the income and they have a long marriage. The husband is described as controlling, not abusive, but clingy and distrustful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around marriage and socializing. In many modern relationships, having independent social lives is normal. However, cultural or personal beliefs might influence this. The husband's reasoning is that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him. That seems outdated. The author wants to go out occasionally, not frequently. The husband's reaction might be overbearing, even if he doesn't use physical abuse.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The author's desire for personal time and social interaction is valid. The husband's need for control and his insistence that it's not normal could be signs of emotional control, which isn't healthy. The fact that the author comes from a non-normal family might have affected her perception of what's acceptable. The key here is whether the husband is being overly controlling versus the author having a legitimate need for independence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't wrong. The responsibility lies with the husband's behavior, not the author's desire for socializing. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
