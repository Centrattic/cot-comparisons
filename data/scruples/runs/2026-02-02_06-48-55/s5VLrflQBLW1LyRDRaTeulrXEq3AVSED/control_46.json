We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends despite being a married mom. The situation involves a 34-year-old woman married for 15 years with four kids. Her husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go to the bar together. He's not against her going out every week or even once a month, just once in a while. The husband's reasoning is that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to do that. He's controlling, wants to protect her, and doesn't trust people. The wife feels he's insistent and she's unsure if he's right because she doesn't have a normal family background and has been with him since she was 16.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether wanting to socialize without her spouse is acceptable. \n\nThe husband's arguments are based on his feelings of being alone and societal norms he believes in. However, there are red flags here. He's controlling, doesn't trust people, is clingy, and might take extreme actions if she goes out anyway. Even though he's not physically abusive, his behavior suggests emotional control. The wife brings in 80% of the income, which might indicate a power imbalance, but that's not directly related to her right to socialize. \n\nFrom a general perspective, in healthy relationships, both partners should have autonomy and privacy. The husband's insistence on controlling her social life might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship. The wife's desire to maintain her own social life is normal and healthy. The fact that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out suggests that he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No) because wanting to have a social life is not the fault of the person, especially when the spouse is being controlling. However, I need to make sure there's no cultural or religious context mentioned here. The user didn't mention any, so it's probably safe to assume it's a general case. \n\nAnother point is that the husband's behavior could be emotionally manipulative. He's convincing her that he's normal and that he's trying to protect her. Since the wife comes from an unstable family and has been with him since 16, she might not have a proper frame of reference for a healthy relationship. Her seeking input from others is a good sign that she's aware of the issue and wants to make an informed decision. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is problematic, and her desire for some independence is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
