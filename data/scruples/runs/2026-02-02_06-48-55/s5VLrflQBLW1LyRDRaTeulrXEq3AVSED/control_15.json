We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The situation involves a 15-year marriage with four kids. The husband doesn't want her to go out socially without him, even though they used to go out before. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, doesn't trust people, and wants all her time. The author brings in most of the income and just wants some fun once in a while.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the husband's control over her social life. He's making it seem like she shouldn't go out without him, even though they used to do that. The fact that he's not physically abusive but still has a lot of control is important. Emotional control can be just as harmful as physical abuse. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone and that it's not normal for a married woman to go out without him sounds like it's based on his own insecurities and need for control. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he might track her down or cause a scene if she goes out. That's a red flag. A healthy relationship should allow both partners to have their own social lives. The husband's insistence on protecting her from \"bad situations\" seems like an excuse to maintain control. The author is seeking validation on whether her desire for independence is normal. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's definitely normal for married people to have friends and socialize without their spouse. The husband's behavior is more about his own issues with trust and control rather than any actual wrongdoing by the author. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to maintain her own social life. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
