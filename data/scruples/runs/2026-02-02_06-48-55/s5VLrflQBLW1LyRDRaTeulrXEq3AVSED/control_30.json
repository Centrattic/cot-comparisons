We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom.\n\nThe author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. They've been married for 15 years, and her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him. He's against it, saying it's not appropriate for a married woman. He doesn't have alcohol issues and they were bar regulars before. Now he's not into it, and he's controlling, possibly to the point of tracking her down or making scenes if she goes out. He claims to be protective and normal, but she feels controlled. She's the main breadwinner, bringing in 80% of the income. She's unsure because her husband has been convincing since she was 16 and she doesn't have a normal family background to compare.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband is being controlling, doesn't trust people, is clingy, and doesn't allow her to socialize without him. She wants autonomy. The question is if she's in the wrong for wanting to go out.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's pretty standard for married individuals to have their own social lives. The husband's stance seems restrictive and possibly possessive. The fact that he's not physically abusive but uses emotional control and insistence on his \"normalcy\" is a red flag. His behavior could be considered emotionally controlling or even emotionally abusive.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking personal time and social interactions. It's healthy for individuals to maintain their own social networks. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not hers. She's responsible, contributes financially, and just wants to have fun occasionally. The fact that he might cause a scene or disrupt her when she goes out exacerbates the problem.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is problematic, and the author is justified in wanting her own social time. There's no indication that her actions are inappropriate; the issue lies with the husband's control and lack of trust.\n"
