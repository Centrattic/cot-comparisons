We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.\nHis reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.\nHe is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. \nI dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.\nI just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go out with friends as a married mom. The author is a 34-year-old married woman with four kids. Her husband, 38, doesn't want her to go out socially without him, citing it's not appropriate for a married woman. They've been married 15 years, and he doesn't want her to go out, even if it's just occasionally. He's not physically abusive but is very controlling, insists he's protecting her, and might track her down or cause a scene if she goes.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The husband is controlling and doesn't trust people, being clingy. He's been with her since she was 16, which might affect her ability to assert herself. She's responsible for most of the income, which adds complexity. Her desire for some independence is understandable. \n\nIn a healthy marriage, both partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a mutual agreement. The husband's stance seems to restrict her autonomy, which could be a sign of controlling behavior. The fact that he might cause a scene or track her down if she goes implies that he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering going against his wishes, which could lead to conflict. But the core issue is whether her wanting to socialize is wrong. Socializing is normal for many people, especially as a way to maintain mental health and friendships. The husband's reasoning that it's not fair for him to be alone might not justify controlling her actions. \n\nThe key points are the husband's controlling behavior versus the wife's need for personal space. The author isn't doing anything harmful; she's seeking a normal social life. The husband's reactions are problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go out. The answer should be B (No).\n"
