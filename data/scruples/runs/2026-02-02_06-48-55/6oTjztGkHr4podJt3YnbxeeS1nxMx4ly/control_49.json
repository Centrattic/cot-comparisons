My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for judging these parents. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a coworker who witnessed a colleague's wife having three babies with severe issues. The first three had heart valve problems likely genetic, leading to very short lives. Another family had three kids with Down syndrome. The author is wondering if they're at fault for feeling judgmental towards these parents for continuing pregnancies despite knowing the likely outcomes.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. People have the right to make reproductive choices, even if others disagree. The parents might have personal, cultural, or religious reasons for continuing pregnancies. The author's judgment could stem from empathy for the parents' pain but may not consider all the factors the parents faced.\n\nJudging others' life choices is generally frowned upon because everyone has different circumstances and values. The author might be projecting their own values onto the parents without understanding their motivations. However, the author's feelings are valid; they might be struggling with the concept of enduring multiple losses or the ethics of bringing children into the world with significant health issues.\n\nAlso, the legal aspect about the definition of a \"human\" in the Down syndrome case is mentioned. But that's a separate issue. The main point is about the author's judgment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the parents' decision is their own. The author's judgment doesn't necessarily make them wrong, but being judgmental can be seen as lacking empathy. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, having questions or feelings of judgment is normal, but acting on them or expressing them in a harmful way would be problematic. Here, the author is asking if their judgment is wrong. Since they're reflecting on their feelings, maybe they're seeking validation. \n\nBut the key is whether the judgment is \"in the wrong.\" If the author is merely having internal conflict, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are actively judging others, that could be seen as wrong. The answer hinges on whether the act of judging is itself wrong. \n\nSociety often encourages compassion and understanding, so judgment without context can be considered wrong. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for judging these parents without knowing their full reasons. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, sometimes people have right to their opinions. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B because the author isn't doing anything harmful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the judgment itself. If the act of judging is considered wrong, then A. If having conflicting feelings is natural, then B. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards A because judgment without understanding can be harmful, even if internal. So the author is in the wrong for judging these parents' decisions.\n"
