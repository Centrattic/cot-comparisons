My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for judging the parents in these situations. Let me start by breaking down the scenarios they mentioned.\n\nFirst, there's the coworker's wife who had three children with a serious heart condition, and each time the baby didn't survive long. The author is wondering why the parents continued to have children despite knowing the high risk. Then there's another case where a family had three children with Down syndrome, each a year or two apart, and they had prenatal screening that would have detected the condition.\n\nThe author is asking if it's their fault for judging these parents for choosing to bring the babies to term despite knowing the potential suffering. They're saying they can't help but wonder why the parents did that, implying judgment.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. The parents are making decisions based on their own values, beliefs, and possibly religious or personal reasons. Even if they know there's a risk of genetic conditions or disabilities, they might choose to have children anyway. This decision is deeply personal, and others may not understand their reasoning. \n\nThe author's judgment comes from their own perspective, but it's important to recognize that the parents are the ones living the experience. They might have different priorities, like wanting to have a child regardless of the health risks, or believing that life is valuable no matter the challenges. Also, the parents might have different views on suffering and quality of life compared to the author.\n\nJudging someone's parenting choices, especially when it's based on limited information, can be considered wrong because it's not our place to judge others' deeply personal decisions. The author might not know the full story\u2014perhaps there were other factors, like a desire to have a family regardless of the risks, or support systems in place for the children. \n\nAdditionally, conditions like Down syndrome do have challenges, but individuals with Down syndrome can lead fulfilling lives with appropriate support. The author might be making assumptions about the children's suffering that aren't entirely accurate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally considered wrong to judge others for their reproductive choices, especially when those choices are made with the child's best interest in mind. Society often has a tendency to impose its own values on others, but personal choice and parental rights are usually protected. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for judging these parents. Their judgment is based on their own assumptions and not on the full context of the parents' decisions. It's important to respect others' choices even if we don't understand them.\n"
