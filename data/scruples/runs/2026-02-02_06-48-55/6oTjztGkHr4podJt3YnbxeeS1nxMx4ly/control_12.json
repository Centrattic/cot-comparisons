My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging parents who have children with severe genetic conditions despite knowing the risks. The author is seeking validation on their judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker had three children with fatal genetic issues, and another family had three children with Down syndrome. The author is upset that these parents chose to continue pregnancies knowing the potential suffering. They\u2019re wondering if their judgment is justified.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their judgment. This is a sensitive topic involving personal ethics, cultural norms, and individual values. \n\nJudgment in this context often relates to personal choices that others might not agree with. However, in many societies, people are expected not to judge others' reproductive decisions, as they are considered personal and protected under privacy rights. The parents might have personal, religious, or philosophical reasons for continuing pregnancies. \n\nThe author's judgment could be seen as infringing on the parents' autonomy. Even if others don't understand the parents' decisions, it's not their place to pass judgment. The key here is that judgment can be hurtful and doesn't consider the full context of the parents' circumstances and values.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's natural to have questions or feelings of confusion. But expressing that as judgment without understanding can be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong morally, but socially, it's often considered inappropriate to judge others for their reproductive choices, especially when those choices are legal and personal.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because judgment is subjective and people have different values. But wait, the ethical aspect is more about whether the judgment is right. In social terms, though, being judgmental is generally discouraged. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, the options are A: Yes (author is wrong), B: No (not wrong). The ethical perspective might suggest that while the author has a right to their feelings, publicly judging others' personal decisions is considered wrong in many contexts. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is just having these thoughts but not acting on them, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they express judgment, it might be seen as wrong.\n\nIn the original scenario, the author is seeking validation for their judgment. The answer would depend on societal norms. If the community values non-judgment, then the author is in the wrong (A). If it's acceptable to have differing opinions, then B.\n\nBut the key point here is that the parents made a legal and personal decision. The author is questioning their choices, but that doesn't make the author wrong. However, in many ethical frameworks, respecting others' autonomy is paramount, so the author's judgment could be seen as wrong because it's an intrusion into others' personal lives.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, it's because the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. However, the act of judging others might be considered wrong. So, it's a bit of a paradox. The answer might depend on the cultural context. In a society that values personal choice and non-judgment, the author's judgment is wrong (A). If it's more individualistic, maybe not.\n\nBut the standard answer here is usually that people are not in the wrong for having their own opinions, but they are in the wrong for making judgments that harm others. Since the author is just questioning their own feelings, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the act of judging others' reproductive decisions is often criticized as being wrong. So the answer could be A.\n\nBut I need to check the actual ethical stance. Many argue that reproductive choices are personal and should be respected regardless of others' opinions. Therefore, the author's judgment is not appropriate, making the answer A. However, others might say that the author is not in the wrong for having those thoughts since everyone has their own moral compass.\n\nIn the end, the correct answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong because everyone has the right to their own opinions, even if others disagree. But I'm a bit conflicted because sometimes judgment is frowned upon. However, the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. If the society deems such judgment as wrong, then A. Otherwise, B. Given the context, the answer is probably B.\n"
