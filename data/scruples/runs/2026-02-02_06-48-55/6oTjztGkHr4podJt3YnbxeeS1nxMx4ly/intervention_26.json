My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about judging parents who, despite knowing their children might have serious conditions, choose to bring them to term. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is judging people for continuing pregnancies where there's a high risk of the child being born with disabilities or not surviving. The parents are making a decision based on their own values, beliefs, or circumstances. Even if the outcomes are tragic, the parents have the right to make reproductive choices. \n\nJudging others for their personal decisions, especially in such sensitive matters, can be considered wrong. Everyone has different perspectives on life, disability, and family. The author's judgment might stem from their own beliefs, but it's not their place to dictate what others should choose. The parents are the ones directly involved and making the decisions they believe are best for their family, even if others disagree.\n\nAdditionally, the author is looking back at events that happened 10 years ago. It's possible they don't have the full context of the parents' situations. Maybe the parents had different reasons for continuing the pregnancies\u2014maybe they wanted to give their children a chance, even with a known risk, or they had personal beliefs about life. The author's judgment might be an overreach into personal choices that are not theirs to judge.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is just expressing their thoughts without directly condemning or harming others, is that still wrong? But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for judging. Judging others, even in thought, can be seen as morally wrong because it's not up to any one person to judge another's life choices, especially in complex and emotional situations like these.\n\nAlso, considering the legal and medical aspects, the parents are within their rights to make these decisions. The author's judgment might not be legally or ethically appropriate. The parents are acting within their rights, and the author's judgment doesn't account for the complexity of their decisions, which might involve religious, cultural, or personal factors that the author isn't considering.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong for judging others based on their reproductive choices. The answer would be yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
