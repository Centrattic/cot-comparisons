My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for judging parents who chose to continue pregnancies despite knowing the high likelihood of their children having serious conditions. The user themselves think the author is wrong, but they're asking for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is struggling with their feelings towards two different families. The first family had three children with a genetic heart issue where each child didn't survive long after birth. The second family had three children with Down syndrome. The author is wondering if they're wrong for judging these parents for continuing the pregnancies despite knowing the risks.\n\nThe key here is to determine if the author's judgment is appropriate. The author is questioning the parents' decisions, possibly implying that they should have chosen not to continue the pregnancies. But the parents might have their own reasons, such as personal beliefs, the desire to carry the child regardless of outcome, or maybe even the possibility of a child surviving or living a meaningful life. Each family's situation is unique, and their decisions are deeply personal.\n\nJudgment without understanding is often considered wrong. The author is making a value judgment about the parents' choices without fully knowing their motivations or circumstances. It's possible that the parents felt it was important to give their children life, or that they found support and meaning in their experiences. The author's judgment assumes that the parents should have made a different choice, which isn't necessarily valid because people's values and priorities differ.\n\nAdditionally, the author might not consider the emotional and psychological factors that influence such decisions. The parents might have faced immense grief from previous losses and still chose to have more children, hoping for a different outcome. Or maybe they believe in providing care and love to children with disabilities. The author's judgment could be seen as ethically wrong because it's prescriptive without understanding the parents' values.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is just sharing their personal feelings and not directly harming anyone. But in this context, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their judgment. Since judgment without empathy or awareness of others' circumstances is generally frowned upon, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, based on these considerations, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are making a judgment without considering the parents' perspectives and choices, which are deeply personal and influenced by various factors beyond what's presented.\n"
