My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for judging these parents who had children with disabilities or conditions. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's coworker had three children, each with a serious heart condition that led to the first two not surviving long. The third might have had the same issue. The author is wondering why they kept having babies knowing the risks. Then there's another case where a family had three kids with Down syndrome, spaced about a year apart, and they presumably knew about it through screening. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for judging these parents for bringing the babies to term despite knowing the potential pain and suffering.\n\nHmm. The author is questioning the parents' decisions. But is it right to judge them? Well, people have the right to make reproductive choices, even if others disagree. The parents might have made those decisions based on their beliefs, values, or hopes that their child could survive or that they wanted to try. Even if the outcomes were tragic, the decision to carry the pregnancy to term is a deeply personal one. The author might be projecting their own views onto the parents, assuming they aren't considering the child's suffering, but that's not necessarily the case. The parents might have different perspectives on life, disability, or the value of their children's lives. \n\nAlso, the author mentions grief counseling, so the parents were dealing with loss. The author's judgment could be seen as insensitive, especially since they had to go through such a painful experience multiple times. It's possible the author isn't considering the complexity of the parents' emotions and decisions. Ethically, it's generally not acceptable to judge others for their reproductive choices unless there's harm involved. Since the parents are making decisions based on their own circumstances, the author's judgment might be unwarranted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for judging without understanding the full context or respecting the parents' autonomy.\n"
