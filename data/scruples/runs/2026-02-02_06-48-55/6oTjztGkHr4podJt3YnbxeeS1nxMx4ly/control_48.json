My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for judging parents who continue pregnancies knowing their children might have disabilities or severe conditions. The scenario involves two cases: one where a family had three babies with heart issues leading to early death, and another with three children with Down syndrome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is questioning the parents' decisions to continue pregnancies despite knowing the potential for their children's suffering. The key here is judgment versus empathy. The author is in a position where they were involved in grief counseling at work, which means they're close enough to the situation to feel the pain of the parents' choices.\n\nJudging others' reproductive choices is a sensitive topic. From a moral standpoint, some people believe that individuals have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and families, even if others disagree. The parents might base their decision on personal beliefs, love, the chance that the child could survive, or the desire to be parents. The author's judgment could be seen as imposing their own values on others, which is generally considered ethically problematic.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing their emotional reaction to the parents' repeated decisions, which might stem from genuine concern. But the issue is whether it's right to judge. In many ethical frameworks, respecting autonomy is paramount. Even if the author disagrees with the parents' choices, they don't have the authority to judge them. The parents are the ones making the daily decisions and facing the consequences, so the author's judgment doesn't address the complexity of their situation.\n\nAdditionally, the legal and medical aspects are mentioned. The parents had screening done, which indicates they had information before proceeding. While the legal status of the fetus is mentioned, the focus here is on the parents' decisions post-screening. The author's judgment might not consider the emotional and psychological factors that influence such decisions.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement towards supporting people's reproductive rights and choices, even when those choices are controversial. Judging others for their reproductive decisions can contribute to stigma, which is harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are imposing their own moral standards without understanding the full context of the parents' decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't acting in a position of power over the parents, so their judgment isn't harmful. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about causing harm. Ethically, judging others' personal decisions, especially in such a sensitive area, is generally frowned upon because it lacks empathy and understanding of the individuals' circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. Their judgment is a moral stance that doesn't respect the parents' autonomy and the complexity of their choices.\n"
