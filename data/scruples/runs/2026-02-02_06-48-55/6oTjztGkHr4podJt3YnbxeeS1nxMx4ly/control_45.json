My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging parents who, despite knowing the high risk of their children being born with serious conditions, decided to bring them to term. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves two main cases: a coworker's family who had three babies with a fatal heart condition and another family with three children with Down syndrome. The author is wondering if they're at fault for judging these parents for choosing to have the babies despite the risk.\n\nThe key here is understanding the ethics of judgment. The author is expressing judgment based on their own perspective, which is a common human reaction. But the question is whether that judgment is wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, each person makes reproductive choices based on their own values, beliefs, and circumstances. The parents in the examples might have deeply personal reasons for continuing their pregnancies. It could be religious beliefs, the hope for a successful outcome, or the emotional impact of terminating a pregnancy. Also, the legal definitions and medical screenings mentioned might influence their decisions, but that's not the core issue here.\n\nJudging others for their reproductive choices is a sensitive topic. While the author might feel that the parents are putting their children through suffering, it's important to recognize that the decision isn't straightforward. The parents might have considered the quality of life, the potential for medical advancements, or the emotional bond they have with their children. \n\nSociety often has conflicting views on this. Some argue that parents should prioritize the child's well-being, while others emphasize the right to procreate and make personal family decisions. The author's judgment, while based on their values, might not consider the complexity of the parents' situations. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. Judgment itself isn't inherently wrong, but acting on it or imposing it on others might be. The author isn't taking any action against the parents, just expressing judgment. That said, in a supportive community or workplace, such judgment could be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nBut from a strict moral standpoint, unless the judgment is causing harm or being enforced on others, it's a personal opinion. The author's thoughts are their own, but they should be aware that their views might not align with others' experiences. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether judgment is considered wrong. If the question is about the morality of holding such a judgment, it's complex. However, in many ethical frameworks, respecting others' autonomy and personal choices is paramount. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for having these thoughts, but they should be cautious about expressing them in a way that could be harmful.\n"
