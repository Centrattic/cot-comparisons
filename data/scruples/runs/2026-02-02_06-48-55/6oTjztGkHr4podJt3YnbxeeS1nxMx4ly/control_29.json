My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for judging parents who had multiple children with severe conditions. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's coworker had three children with fatal genetic issues and a family had three children with Down syndrome. The author is wondering if it's wrong to judge these parents for continuing the pregnancies despite knowing the potential suffering. The key here is whether the author's judgment is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. The parents might have their own reasons for continuing the pregnancies, even with the risks. These could include personal beliefs, medical advice, or the desire to carry the child to term regardless of the outcome. It's possible that the parents didn't receive the same genetic counseling each time, or maybe they were hopeful for a different outcome.\n\nJudgment without full information can be problematic. The author might not know the full context of the parents' decisions. For example, maybe they wanted to try for a healthy child and each time it didn't work out. Or they might have felt a moral obligation to try again. It's also important to note that reproductive decisions are deeply personal and influenced by various factors.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, judging others for their reproductive choices can be seen as imposing one's values. It's generally considered unethical to judge others' medical or family decisions unless there's clear harm involved. However, the author is reflecting on their own feelings of judgment, which is common, but the question is whether that judgment is wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a key principle. Parents have the right to make decisions about their pregnancies based on their own values and circumstances. The author's judgment might stem from a place of empathy, but it's not their role to judge unless there's a legal or ethical obligation. The author's feelings are valid, but the act of judging might not be justified without understanding the full story.\n\nAlso, considering that these are past events (10 years ago), societal attitudes towards disability and genetic conditions have evolved, but the parents' decisions at the time were based on their available information and values. It's possible that the author's current understanding is different from what the parents knew then.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's judgment is a personal reaction, it's important to recognize that reproductive choices are complex and personal. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but the judgment itself might not be justified without more context. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for judging. Since the judgment is a common human reaction, even if misguided, it's not inherently wrong. But the correct answer here is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for their judgment, as it's a personal opinion rather than an ethical obligation.\n"
