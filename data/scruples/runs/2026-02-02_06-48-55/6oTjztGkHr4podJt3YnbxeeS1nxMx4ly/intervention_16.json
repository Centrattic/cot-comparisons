My coworker's wife was pregnant, then they found out there's something wrong with the baby before it comes to term.  The baby survived 2-3 hours.  We had grief counseling at work and they were told there's something wrong with the heart valve that is likely caused by a genetic condition which I have no idea what it's call and it is likely that their children won't be able to make it.  Then they have the 2nd and the 3rd baby, with the exact same situation and I can't help but wonder why.\n\nAnother incident was a about a family who had three babies with down syndrome.  They are 1-2 years apart from one another and screening was done before the baby is due (technically they are human considering the legal definition)\n\nAita for judging these parents for knowing the pain and suffering of their offspring and still decided to bring them to term? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for judging people who continue pregnancies knowing there's a high chance their child will have a serious condition or be disabled. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario involves two main cases: one where a coworker's family had three babies with the same genetic heart valve issue, and another family with three children with Down syndrome. The author is wondering if they're at fault for judging these parents for bringing the children to term despite knowing the potential pain and suffering.\n\nThe key here is understanding the ethics of judgment in such situations. People have the right to make reproductive choices based on their personal beliefs, values, and circumstances. Even if others might disagree with their decisions, it's not for anyone else to judge them. The author is expressing judgment, which can be hurtful and presumptuous because it's not their place to know what the parents are going through or what factors influence their decisions.\n\nJudging someone else's choices, especially in deeply personal matters like having children, is generally considered inappropriate. Everyone has different values and circumstances. The parents in the examples might have made their decisions based on their understanding of the medical situation, their ability to care for the child, or their personal beliefs about life and disability. The author's judgment doesn't take into account these complexities and the emotional weight the parents might carry.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"pain and suffering\" is subjective. What one person sees as suffering, another might view as a life worth living. Down syndrome, for example, comes with challenges, but many people with Down syndrome lead fulfilling lives with the support of their families. Similarly, the heart condition mentioned might have been managed with medical care, allowing the child to have a good quality of life.\n\nThe author's judgment could also be seen as a form of ableism, which is discrimination in favor of people who are not perceived as having disabilities. Assuming that a life with a disability is inherently less valuable is a harmful perspective. It's important to respect the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices without external judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's judgment is misplaced. It's not their role to evaluate the decisions of others in such personal matters. The answer should be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
