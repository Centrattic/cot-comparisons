She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend that she should get a job and not rely on her family's allowance and Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's degree but has never worked a job. Her family is financially stable, giving her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She wants to move in with him, and he expects her to cover half the rent and bills. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing. The author is against this, pushing her to get a job, pointing out the financial instability of relying on her allowance and side hustle. He also comments on her content and her friends' lifestyles, which upsets her. She feels he's being disrespectful and called him names in response.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. However, his approach might be harsh. He criticized her aspirations (mentioning her posts), which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if his intentions are valid, the way he communicated his concerns might have been dismissive or condescending. He also brought up her friends' situations, which could be a sensitive area. The girlfriend is in a transition phase, moving from a supported environment to independence, and his reaction might have invalidated her efforts or goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to expect financial responsibility in a shared living situation. He's making a valid point about financial stability. However, the conflict arises from how he expressed those concerns. The question is whether being direct and honest is being an asshole or if the method of communication crosses into disrespect.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the message is correct, the delivery can hurt feelings. The author's comments about her content and friends might be seen as belittling. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she felt judged and devalued, which is a common response when someone's insecurities are attacked, even if the intent is to push for better habits.\n\nSo, while the author's concerns are understandable and valid, the way he expressed them\u2014especially the comments about her Instagram content and her friends\u2014might make him the asshole here. It's possible he's right about the financial aspect but wrong in his delivery. The answer hinges on balancing the validity of his concerns with the respect shown to his partner. If the advice was given constructively, it might have been better received. Instead, the approach was confrontational and perhaps hurtful, leading to the argument.\n"
