She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to finish her master's degree. She hasn't had a job before, lives with her well-off family, and gets a $1k+ monthly allowance. They're discussing moving in together, and she plans to use her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram (with 8k followers) for income via affiliate marketing. The author is pushing her to get a job, saying she needs to be productive and realistic. He's concerned she'll struggle financially and expects him to cover the costs if she doesn't work. She got upset, feeling he's being harsh and calling her a bum.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's intentions: He's trying to be responsible, wanting her to have a stable income. He's worried about their future together if she relies on family money and Instagram, which might not be reliable. His concerns are valid from a financial standpoint. He's not forcing her to move in but is setting boundaries about how they'll split costs. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: She's transitioning from academia to the workforce, which can be stressful. She's relying on family support, which is common for some people. Her plan to use Instagram for income isn't impossible\u2014many people do succeed in affiliate marketing, though it's often hard work. The author's criticism about her content might come off as dismissive or belittling, even if he's trying to be honest. The comment about her posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" is probably hurtful and could be seen as objectifying, which is a big no-no in relationships. That line might have been the most damaging, making her feel undervalued.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and respect. The author's message, while rooted in concern, was delivered in a way that made her feel like a failure. Even if his intention was to encourage responsibility, the manner\u2014calling her a \"bum,\" criticizing her chosen method of income, and making a comment about her body\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, considering her background: she's coming from a supportive family, which might mean she hasn't had to navigate financial independence before. His approach might not account for her need for support and encouragement rather than criticism. Relationships require empathy; maybe he could have approached the conversation differently, focusing on collaboration instead of criticism.\n\nHowever, from a practical standpoint, his concerns are valid. She needs a stable income if they're moving in together. The author isn't wrong in wanting her to be financially responsible, but how he communicated it might be where he's at fault. \n\nSo balancing both sides: He's not entirely wrong for having concerns, but his delivery was harsh and disrespectful. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. Since the user asked for A (yes in the wrong) or B (no), considering that while his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them was hurtful and disrespectful, leading to the conflict. Therefore, he's partially at fault for the way he communicated, even if his intentions were good. So the answer would be A.\n"
