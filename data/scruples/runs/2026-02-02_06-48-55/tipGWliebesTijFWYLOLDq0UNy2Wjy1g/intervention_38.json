She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The setup is that the author (M22) is arguing with his girlfriend (F23) about her not having a job and relying on her parents' allowance. He wants her to get a job, while she wants to move in with him and use her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's and has never worked. Her parents are wealthy, giving her $1k a month. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing. The author is concerned about her financial stability and wants her to be independent. He's okay with her paying half the rent but is upset that she's relying on family money and not working a traditional job.\n\nThe key points here are financial independence, expectations in a relationship, and communication. The author is pushing for her to become self-sufficient, which is a valid concern, especially when moving in together. However, he's also being critical of her income strategy (posting certain content) and making assumptions about her friends and their situations.\n\nThe girlfriend feels hurt and accuses him of making her feel like a \"bum.\" The author's tone might be harsh, even if his intentions are good. He's questioning her ability to make money through Instagram, which could come across as dismissive of her efforts. Also, he's implying that her friends are not contributing to society, which might be a sensitive topic.\n\nFinancial expectations in relationships can be tricky. The author is right to want her to be independent, but his approach might be too confrontational. He might not have considered her perspective or the pressure she's under from her family's financial support. Maybe he should have approached the conversation with more empathy, discussing practical steps together instead of being critical.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not be realistic about how much money she can make through affiliate marketing alone. The author's concern about her financial stability is legitimate. However, his method of communication\u2014calling her a \"bum\" and criticizing her content\u2014could have been more respectful.\n\nSo, in terms of whether he's in the wrong: if the author's approach was mean-spirited or dismissive of her plans, that's a problem. But if his intentions were to encourage her independence and he communicated that poorly, it's a mix. However, since he's making assumptions about her ability to earn money and is being judgmental about her methods, that might be where he's in the wrong. The right approach would be to support her in exploring different options, including traditional jobs and her Instagram, while discussing realistic financial planning together.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he was harsh and judgmental in his communication, even if his intentions were to encourage her independence. He didn't consider her feelings and made assumptions about her capabilities and her friends.\n"
