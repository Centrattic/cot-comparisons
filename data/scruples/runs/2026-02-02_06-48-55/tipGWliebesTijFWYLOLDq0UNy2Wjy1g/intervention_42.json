She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to finish her master's degree. She's never had a job, gets an allowance from her well-off parents, and wants to move in with him, paying half the rent with her allowance and plans to make money through Instagram affiliate marketing. The guy advised her to get a job instead, and she got upset, feeling he called her a bum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman comes from a financially stable family, so she's used to support. She's moving in with her boyfriend, and he's concerned about her financial independence. He's telling her she needs to work, not rely on her parents and social media. She's upset because he criticized her approach.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics and expectations. The guy is trying to encourage responsibility, which is reasonable. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her out for not working, which could be hurtful, especially if she feels his criticism is invalidating her efforts or her current support system.\n\nFinancial independence is important in relationships, but how you approach it matters. If he's pressuring her without understanding her perspective, that could be problematic. Also, his comment about her using Instagram for affiliate marketing by posting certain content might be dismissive and disrespectful, even if he's skeptical about its viability.\n\nThe guy's intentions might be good\u2014wanting her to be self-sufficient. But the tone and the specific remarks about her Instagram content could be seen as condescending or disrespectful. He's also projecting his own financial goals onto her without considering her personal choices or the support she's had.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate supportively rather than being critical. While it's valid to discuss financial planning, the approach here seems to lack empathy. The girl might feel that her contributions or her plan to earn money are being dismissed, especially if she's transitioning from an academic environment to the workforce.\n\nSo, the question is whether his approach was wrong. The answer hinges on the balance between encouraging responsibility and maintaining respect. If he's being overly critical and judgmental, that's a problem. The author might be in the wrong for how he expressed his concerns, even if the concerns themselves are valid. The key is the method of communication and respect for her autonomy.\n"
