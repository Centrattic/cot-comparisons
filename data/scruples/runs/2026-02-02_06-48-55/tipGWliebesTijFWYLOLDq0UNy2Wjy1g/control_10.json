She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (M22) and his girlfriend (F23) who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. She's getting an allowance from her parents and wants to move in with him, paying half the rent using her allowance and plans to monetize her Instagram. The author is against this, urging her to get a job instead, and they had a fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is concerned about their financial future and wants her to be independent. He's not against her moving in, but he's worried about her financial approach. On the other hand, she's in a position where her family supports her, and she might not be used to the financial responsibilities of adulthood. \n\nThe key points are: \n- The author is pushing her to get a job for financial stability and independence.\n- She's relying on an allowance and potential side income from social media.\n- The author is worried about future financial strain and possible expectations of him covering expenses.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a valid concern about financial responsibility. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He criticized her lifestyle and implied she's not an adult, which could be hurtful. While his intentions might be good, the manner in which he conveyed his concerns could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's situation is different. She has family support, so maybe she's not in a rush. But if they're moving in together, financial independence is important for both partners. The author's push for her to get a job is reasonable, but the way he did it might have been insensitive. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the criticism was constructive or if it came off as judgmental. The author's comments about her Instagram posts and friends could be seen as belittling. That part definitely contributes to the conflict. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the tone and approach matter. Even if the underlying issue is valid, the way it's handled can make someone the \"asshole.\" Here, the author's harsh words and judgmental language likely contributed to the girlfriend feeling insulted. So even if his concerns are valid, the method was inappropriate, making him at least partially in the wrong."
