She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's start by understanding the scenario. The user is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a relationship with his 23-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. She's about to get her master's degree and has never had a job before. Her family is financially stable\u2014her dad is a dentist and her mom an accountant\u2014and they give her over $1,000 a month in allowance. Now, she wants to move in with him, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. However, he's concerned because she plans to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) to make money via affiliate marketing instead of getting a traditional job. He told her she needs to become a productive member of society and work a real job, which led to her being upset and feeling attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his concerns are valid. He's worried that relying on her allowance and affiliate marketing from Instagram, which he sees as not involving real work, might lead to financial instability. He points out that even if she works minimum wage, she could have a steady income. His main point is about encouraging her to transition to the real world and take on adult responsibilities, which seems reasonable. After all, many people do need to work for a living, and having a job can provide not just income but also life experience and independence.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors here are the motivation behind his comments and how they were delivered. He was trying to be honest about the financial realities of moving in together, which is a valid concern. However, his delivery might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her for living off her parents, and made a comment about her posting on Instagram for money, implying it's not legitimate. Even if his intentions were good, the way he communicated his concerns could have been more supportive. Relationships require communication, but it's also important to consider the other person's feelings and the context of their life choices.\n\nShe's in a position where her family can support her, and she's planning to use her existing platform (Instagram) to generate income. While this might be less conventional than a traditional job, it's not unheard of. Many people do make a living through social media and affiliate marketing. The user's judgment that she's not working and is instead living off her parents and friends might be dismissing her efforts and the potential of her chosen path. He also mentioned that she might not be aware of the financial struggles because her social circle is similar, which is a valid point, but he could have approached the conversation with more empathy.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic of their relationship. He's the one who's willing to let her pay half the rent, but he's pushing her to have a job. Is this a demand for her to conform to his views on financial responsibility, or is he genuinely concerned for her future? If it's the former, it might come off as controlling. If it's the latter, then it's a matter of how the message was delivered. The problem is that he used strong language that could be seen as degrading, which might have made her feel criticized rather than supported.\n\nAlso, considering that she's about to finish her master's, maybe she's in a transition phase. It's possible she's looking for ways to leverage her education and her social media presence. The user's approach might not have acknowledged her capabilities or the value of her current plan. Instead, he dismissed it outright, which could be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a common belief that having a job is necessary for being a \"productive member of society.\" But that's a broad generalization. Productivity can come in many forms, and if she's using her skills on Instagram effectively, that could be just as valid. However, the user's perspective is that she's not preparing for the real world, which is a legitimate concern when it comes to living independently and handling finances.\n\nThe conflict here seems to stem from differing values on what constitutes productivity and financial responsibility. The user wants her to have a traditional job, while she's pursuing a non-traditional income path. The issue is whether the user was wrong to express his concerns. While it's important to have these conversations, the way he did it\u2014using hurtful language and implying she's not an adult\u2014might have been the main issue. He should have discussed his worries without belittling her, perhaps suggesting a compromise or exploring the feasibility of her Instagram plan together.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's intentions might be good, but his approach was probably too harsh and judgmental. That's why the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he could have communicated his concerns more constructively without attacking her character or choices.\n"
