She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy in a relationship with a girl, is telling her she needs to get a job because she's relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. She's about to finish her master's and hasn't worked before. The guy is worried that if she moves in with him, they'll have financial issues because her allowance might not cover everything, and he doesn't want to support her financially beyond splitting the rent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is coming from a financially stable family, getting $1k a month. She's planning to use Instagram for affiliate marketing, which might not be reliable. The author is concerned about financial stability and responsibility. He's right to be worried if she's not working a real job, as affiliate marketing can be unpredictable. But how he communicated that to her might be the problem.\n\nThe girl is graduating, so she might be at a transition point. The author's approach was to tell her she's not being productive, which could come off as harsh. He criticized her for not working and implied that her Instagram posts are not a valid way to earn money, calling them \"pics of her ass and tits.\" That's pretty direct and could be seen as disrespectful. Even if his intentions are valid, the way he delivered the message might have hurt her feelings. She felt like he was calling her a bum, which indicates that the conversation was not handled well.\n\nFinancial independence is important in a relationship, especially when moving in together. The author is right to want her to be responsible for her own finances. However, telling her she's not an adult and making her feel like a failure might be counterproductive. Maybe he should have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging her situation but discussing practical steps. Instead of being critical, he could have supported her in finding a job or exploring affiliate marketing more seriously, while also setting boundaries.\n\nAlso, the fact that her friends are in similar situations might influence her perspective. She's used to a certain lifestyle and now the author is challenging that. The shock of moving from a supported environment to financial responsibility can be stressful. The author's approach might have been too abrupt without considering her emotional state.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the message is correct, the delivery can affect how it's received. The author's message was about responsibility, but the way he phrased it, especially the part about her Instagram posts, could be seen as condescending or dismissive. That's probably why she got upset. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but the way he handled it could be better. So, the answer might depend on whether the criticism was constructive or just hurtful.\n"
