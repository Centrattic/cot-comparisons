She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing moving in together, where the girlfriend doesn't have a job and relies on her parents' allowance. The author tells her she needs to get a job instead of relying on her Instagram and parents. She got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that she should be more productive and not just depend on her family and social media. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about financial responsibility. He's renting an apartment and expects her to contribute half the rent. The girlfriend's plan is to use her allowance and affiliate marketing. The author thinks she's not realistic about her income and might struggle financially. \n\nIs he right to express his concerns? Well, when moving in together, financial discussions are important. The author is being honest about his expectations, which is reasonable. But maybe the way he communicated it was harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" which is derogatory. Even if his intentions are good, the language might have been unkind. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's background: she's about to get a master's degree and hasn't worked before. Maybe she's in a different life phase where she's focusing on education and building her online presence. The author is pushing her towards traditional employment, which might not be the only valid path. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's criticism was justified and if the method of communication was respectful. While the author has valid concerns about financial stability, the way he expressed them might have been dismissive and hurtful. The term \"bum\" is particularly harsh. Additionally, he's making assumptions about her Instagram content, which could be condescending.\n\nOn the other hand, expecting her to be financially responsible when moving in together is reasonable. But the author could have approached the conversation more empathetically instead of being critical. The girlfriend's reaction is also a factor; feeling devalued and called names is a red flag for how the message was delivered.\n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the author's concerns are valid, but the delivery was poor. Therefore, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the harsh communication, but not entirely. However, the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to choose. The main issue is the judgment of her being a \"bum\" and the dismissive attitude towards her plans. That's a strong indicator of being in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
