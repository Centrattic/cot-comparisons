She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society. She's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a stipend, and she plans to use that plus her Instagram to cover her share of the rent. The guy is against that and thinks she should get a job. She got upset and called him a few names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He's earning $70k this year and wants her to have a stable income. He's not okay with her relying on her parents and her Instagram, which he doubts will be sufficient. He wants her to get a job, which is a reasonable request. On the other hand, he criticized her for not working and called her a \"bum,\" which might have been harsh. Also, he mentioned her posting \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which sounds judgmental and could have been offensive. \n\nHer side is that she's transitioning from a comfortable, well-off family into a more independent life. She might not have real-world experience, so the guy's comments about her not being prepared could be valid, but his delivery might be the problem. He's right to want her to be financially responsible, but the way he expressed it might have come off as condescending or disrespectful. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is the tone and the content of his message. Saying she's a \"bum\" and making a comment about her Instagram content (especially body posts) could be seen as attacking her character and her efforts. Even if his intentions were good, the harshness of his message might justify her feeling hurt. However, his concern about financial stability is legitimate. \n\nSo, balancing the two: while he's right to encourage her to work, the way he communicated it was probably rude. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because of the condescending and potentially offensive remarks, even if his reasoning is sound. But others might argue that he's just being realistic and that she needs to hear it. However, the way he said it matters here. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the harsh delivery and the judgmental comments.\n"
