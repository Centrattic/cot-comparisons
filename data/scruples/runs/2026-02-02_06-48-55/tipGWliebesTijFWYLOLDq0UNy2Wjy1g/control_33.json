She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy in a relationship with a girl, is telling her she needs to get a job and be more productive instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. The girl is about to finish her master's, has never worked before, and plans to live with him, paying half the rent using her allowance and affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about her financial independence and stability. He's worried that relying on her parents' money and possibly not having a stable income from Instagram might lead to financial struggles for both of them. He's trying to be responsible and set realistic expectations for their future together. That makes sense because if they live together, both should contribute fairly and responsibly. It's important for both partners to be financially stable to avoid arguments and stress later on.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that the author is being dismissive of her plans and not supportive. She might feel that he's undermining her efforts to make money through Instagram, even if it's a different path. She could see his comments as belittling, especially when he mentions her posting \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which is a bit harsh and could come off as disrespectful. That part might be where he oversteps. Even if his intentions are good, the way he communicates his concerns could hurt her feelings and make her feel attacked.\n\nAlso, the girl hasn't had a job before, so maybe she's not aware of the financial realities. The author is trying to prepare her, but maybe he should have approached it more gently. Being direct is good, but the tone matters. If he criticized her lifestyle without understanding her perspective or giving her credit for her efforts, that could be the issue. She might feel that he's not respecting her choices or not supporting her in finding alternative ways to make money.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is planning to move in together soon, so financial responsibilities are a big part of the discussion. He's right to bring it up, but the way he did might have been too confrontational. Maybe he should have had a more collaborative approach, discussing options and supporting her in exploring different avenues instead of just dismissing her plans.\n\nThe key points here are communication style, mutual respect, and understanding each other's perspectives. The author's intentions are good, but the method of delivery might be where he's in the wrong. The girl's feelings are valid too; she might feel that her aspirations are being undervalued. So, even if the financial advice is practical, the way it's delivered could be hurtful and damaging to the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely wrong for trying to address financial responsibility, but his approach in the conversation could be seen as harsh and disrespectful, which is where the fault lies. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of how he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves.\n"
