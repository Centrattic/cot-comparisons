She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The girlfriend is graduating with a master's but has never had a job. The guy is concerned about financial stability when they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that his girlfriend is not taking financial responsibility seriously. He's worried she'll struggle financially and he might end up having to support her. He's suggesting she get a job, which is a common expectation in adult relationships, especially when sharing living expenses. His intentions might be to ensure they can both be financially responsible and not rely on others.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's transitioning from academia to a career, possibly planning to monetize her Instagram. She might feel that the guy is dismissive of her efforts and not supportive. The comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as disrespectful or belittling, even if the guy had a point about the feasibility of her income plan. The way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh, making her feel attacked instead of supported.\n\nFinancial discussions in relationships can be tricky. The guy's approach might be well-intentioned, but the manner in which he delivered his message could have been hurtful. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" and using derogatory language can damage the relationship, even if the underlying issue is valid. The girlfriend's feelings of being a \"bum\" and the guy being an \"asshole\" suggest that the communication wasn't constructive.\n\nAlso, the guy's comment about her friends and their lifestyles might imply judgment about her social circle, which could be another point of contention. While financial responsibility is important, the way he framed the issue might have come across as condescending or lacking empathy for her situation.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a balance between addressing a legitimate concern (financial responsibility) and respecting the other person's feelings and aspirations. If he had approached the conversation with more empathy and support, perhaps suggesting possible job opportunities or discussing realistic financial planning together, the outcome might have been different. Instead, the way he presented his arguments might have invalidated her efforts and made her feel attacked, which is a common mistake in such sensitive discussions.\n\nSo, considering the communication style and the potential insensitivity, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's also a valid concern about financial responsibility. However, the way he expressed his concerns likely contributed to the conflict, making the answer A.\n"
