She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree but has never worked. She's getting a $1k+ allowance from her parents. They plan to move in together, and the author is concerned she'll expect him to cover expenses if she uses her allowance for half the rent and tries to make money through Instagram. He tells her she needs a job, which she takes as criticism, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, expecting a partner to be financially responsible is reasonable. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future, which is a valid concern. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He called her a \"bum\" and an asshole, which is harsh. Even if his intentions were good, the tone and choice of words could be hurtful. Also, he was dismissive of her plans for affiliate marketing, which might not be fair\u2014some people do make a decent income through that. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is about to graduate and hasn't worked a job. Relying on an allowance and Instagram might not be sustainable. The author is pushing her to be more independent, which is a responsible approach. However, the way he delivered the message and the condescending remarks (like \"posting pics of her ass and tits\") might have been unnecessary and disrespectful.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent versus the execution. The author's concern is valid, but the method of addressing it could have been more constructive. The girlfriend's reaction is partly because of how she was spoken to, not just the content. So, the author might be in the wrong for the way he communicated, even if his concerns are justified. \n\nBut in relationships, financial expectations are a big deal. The author is setting boundaries, which is okay. However, the language he used was harsh and could be seen as belittling. The answer might be a mix, but since the question is a yes/no for being in the wrong, I think the answer is A (Yes) because the way he expressed his concerns was hurtful and disrespectful, even if his intentions were good.\n"
