She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old guy, is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is 23. She's about to finish her master's degree and has never had a job before. Her family is financially well-off, giving her around $1k a month as an allowance. She wants to move in with him, and the author is okay with her paying half the rent. However, when discussing how she'll cover the rent and bills, she says she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram to make money through affiliate marketing. The author is against this, telling her she needs to get a job and \"move into the real world.\" He argues that she could work a minimum wage job and have a better income than relying on her parents and affiliate marketing. He also mentions he doesn't want to cover her expenses even though he's earning $70k this year. The girlfriend got upset, feeling criticized and called a \"bum,\" and they had an argument.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks he is but wants to know my take. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and setting a good example. He wants his girlfriend to become independent and not rely on her parents or potentially unstable income sources like affiliate marketing. His reasoning is practical: a minimum wage job would provide more consistent income, and he's worried about the financial strain if she doesn't contribute adequately. It's true that relying on an allowance and social media income might not be sustainable long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has just completed a master's degree and hasn't needed a job before. She might be in a different lifestyle bubble, given her family's financial support and her friends' similar situations. Her plan to use Instagram for affiliate marketing could be her idea of a career path, even if it's not traditional. The author's blunt approach might have come off as dismissive and judgmental, especially when he mentions her Instagram content and her friends. His comment about her not being in the \"real world\" and his friends not being in the real world might have invalidated her experiences and aspirations, leading to her feeling attacked.\n\nThe key points here are the approach and the communication. The author's concerns are valid, but the way he expressed them might have been hurtful. Instead of supporting her in exploring her options, he criticized her lifestyle and made her feel like a failure. The argument about her needing to get a job is practical, but the delivery\u2014using derogatory terms, questioning her methods, and comparing her to others\u2014could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, how we communicate our concerns matters a lot. Even if the content of the message is about financial responsibility, the tone and choice of words can affect the other person's feelings. The author could have approached the conversation by discussing their shared goals for the future, exploring both options (like a part-time job and affiliate marketing) and working together to find a solution. Instead, he took a confrontational stance, which led to conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of independence versus support. The author wants his partner to be independent, which is admirable, but pushing her to abandon her current path without understanding her perspective might not be the best approach. It's possible that she has reasons for not wanting a traditional job that the author isn't considering. Also, suggesting that her Instagram content (even if it's not what he approves of) is the only way she can make money might be unfair, as content creation can be a legitimate career path, though it's true that it can be inconsistent.\n\nAdditionally, the author's mention of his own income and not wanting to cover her expenses could come off as a threat or a way to pressure her into compliance. Instead of focusing on their mutual future, it might have sounded like he's more concerned about his own financial burden.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be about responsibility and preparation, the way he communicated his concerns was harsh and dismissive. This could lead to the other person feeling undervalued and criticized, which isn't healthy in a relationship. The right approach would involve mutual respect and collaboration, not one-sided criticism.\n"
