She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (a 22-year-old man) telling his girlfriend (GF) she needs to become a productive member of society by getting a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to monetize her Instagram with 8k followers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that his GF, who's about to finish her master's, hasn't worked before and is moving in with him. He's concerned about how she'll afford half the rent and bills. He suggests she get a job, which he thinks would be more reliable than her current plan of affiliate marketing through her Instagram. He's worried about the financial stability and that she might expect him to cover the costs if her plan fails. He also mentions she's in a bubble with friends who are similar, not facing real-world financial struggles.\n\nThe GF's perspective is that she's upset and feels judged. She's using her Instagram, which he's dismissive of, even though he acknowledges her assets. She might feel that his comments are belittling her efforts and her aspirations. She might also feel that he's not considering her autonomy or her chosen path to financial independence, even if it's unconventional.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's being practical. He's concerned about their financial future together. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to shared expenses, and suggesting a job isn't unreasonable. However, the way he communicated this might be the issue. He came across as judgmental, using phrases like \"make money through affiliate marketing\" and mocking her Instagram posts. That's where the hurt likely came from. He might have been dismissive of her plans without considering her perspective or the feasibility of her Instagram venture. Even if he thinks it's not reliable, he shouldn't have insulted her efforts or her content.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that she's coming from a financially stable family might mean she's not used to managing money or working, so his advice is valid in terms of financial preparedness. But his delivery could have been more supportive. Instead of criticizing her current approach, he could have discussed the risks and benefits of both options (a job vs. affiliate marketing) and found a middle ground. His comments about her friends and implying she's not a \"real adult\" because she hasn't worked yet might have been condescending.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the content of the message is valid, the delivery can affect how it's received. The author's approach might have been too harsh and lacking in empathy. He didn't present his concerns constructively but rather as criticisms, which led to her feeling attacked. Therefore, while his concerns are understandable, the way he expressed them likely contributed to her feeling defensive and upset. That makes him at least partially in the wrong for not handling the conversation more sensitively.\n"
