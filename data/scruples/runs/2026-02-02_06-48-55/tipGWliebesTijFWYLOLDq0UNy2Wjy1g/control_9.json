She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's asking if he's at fault for telling his girlfriend to become more productive and get a job. She's about to finish her master's, has never worked, and relies on her family's allowance. She wants to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media, which he thinks isn't reliable. He's concerned about financial stability and independence. His reasoning is valid in terms of practicality\u2014like how relying on an allowance might not be sustainable, and affiliate marketing might not be enough. But the way he communicated this might have come off as harsh. He mentioned she's \"a bum,\" called her friends out for not being in the real world, and implied she's not contributing properly. That could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being realistic about financial responsibilities. She might not have experience with managing money or understanding the real world's demands. His concern about their future living situation and financial responsibilities is reasonable. But the way he expressed his concerns without considering her feelings or her goals could be problematic. Maybe he should have approached it with more empathy, acknowledging her situation before pushing for change.\n\nAlso, the fact that her parents are supportive and she's finishing a master's might mean she's in a different phase compared to others. It's possible she's planning to use her education in a way that doesn't require a traditional job, but he's not seeing that. The conflict here is between his practical approach and her current lifestyle, which he's criticizing. He might be right in wanting her to be financially independent, but the manner of his criticism might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely wrong in his intentions but could be in the wrong in how he communicated his concerns. It's a balance between being practical and being considerate. The key issue is whether his approach was respectful. Since he used somewhat derogatory language (\"bum,\" \"just posting pics of her ass and tits\") even if he's being honest, that's likely where the fault lies. So the answer might be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
