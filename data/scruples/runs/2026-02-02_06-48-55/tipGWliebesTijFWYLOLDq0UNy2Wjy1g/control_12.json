She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male, is telling his girlfriend, who is 23 and about to finish her master's degree, that she needs to get a job and not rely on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has never had a job, is being supported by her wealthy family, and plans to use her parents' money to cover half the rent when they move in. She's also relying on Instagram, which the author thinks is not a stable income. The author's main points are about financial responsibility and real-world experience. He's concerned she's not prepared for the realities of living independently and might expect him to cover expenses.\n\nNow, the girlfriend gets upset, feeling criticized. She calls him names, and he's asking if he's the asshole. To determine if he's wrong, I need to assess if his criticism is reasonable and if his approach was respectful.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern. It's important for individuals to be self-sufficient, especially in a relationship where both parties contribute. The author is pointing out practical issues\u2014like her not having a stable income and the potential for financial strain. However, the way he communicated it might be the issue. He called her a \"bum,\" questioned her methods (like making money off \"pics of her ass and tits\"), and criticized her friends' lifestyles. That could come off as dismissive or condescending, even if his intentions were good.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not wrong to be concerned about financial responsibility. Relying on family money and an uncertain income stream (Instagram affiliate marketing) is risky. He's trying to set realistic expectations for their future together, which is a responsible approach. But the manner in which he delivered his message might have been harsh, contributing to her feelings of being attacked.\n\nSo, the balance here is between being financially responsible and the approach taken. If his criticism was constructive, he might be justified. But if he was disrespectful or overly critical without considering her perspective, he could be at fault. The key factors are the validity of his concerns versus the method of communication.\n"
