She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for advising his girlfriend to become more productive. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is about to get her master's degree but has never worked a job. She's getting a $1k+ allowance from her parents, who are dentists and accountants. She wants to move in with the author, paying half the rent. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is pushing her to get a job, arguing that relying on her parents and affiliate marketing isn't sustainable. He's concerned she's not realistic about finances, expecting him to cover expenses if she doesn't earn enough. She got upset, feeling called out for not working, and he used derogatory terms, which hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author's intentions might be valid\u2014he wants her to be financially responsible and independent. However, his approach seems harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" and calling them names, even if in frustration, is disrespectful. Also, he's dismissing her plan to monetize Instagram, which could be a valid path for some people, though maybe risky. He's right to express concerns about financial stability, but the way he communicated it was hurtful. Relationships require communication that's constructive, not devaluing. The key points here are his harsh language and invalidating her aspirations without understanding the potential of her chosen route. Even if his advice is well-meaning, the method was inappropriate. So, the answer is likely A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong for how he handled it.\n"
