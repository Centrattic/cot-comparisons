She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who is the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her over $1,000 a month, and she wants to move in with him. She plans to use the allowance to cover half the rent and bills, and then grow her Instagram for affiliate marketing. The author told her she needs to get a job and not just rely on her parents and social media, which made her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is concerned that his girlfriend isn't being productive and is not preparing to become financially independent. He's suggesting she get a job, which is a common expectation in relationships, especially when moving in together. However, he also made a comment about her Instagram content, which might have been harsh or disrespectful.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a real financial issue. Moving in together requires both parties to contribute, and he's worried she'll expect him to cover everything if her income is insufficient. His advice to get a job is practical and responsible. People often need to be financially stable before cohabiting, and he's setting boundaries to avoid future problems.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have been hurtful. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or a \"dick\" isn't constructive. It's possible that his approach was too direct or condescending, making her feel attacked rather than supported. Also, criticizing her Instagram strategy by mentioning the content (posts of her body) could be seen as judgmental, even if he's concerned about her financial approach. Maybe he could have offered more specific help or expressed his worries in a kinder manner.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's financial situation is different. She comes from a well-off family, so depending on an allowance isn't unheard of. However, moving in with a partner and expecting the same level of support from her parents might not be sustainable. The author's point about her needing to transition into adulthood and real-world financial responsibilities is valid, but the delivery matters a lot here.\n\nAlso, the author is on track to make $70k this year, so he might have the means to support her if he chose to, but he's not willing to. That's a personal choice, but he's not in the wrong for not wanting to be the sole financial provider. However, he should respect her autonomy in deciding how to use her resources.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author might be right in his concerns, but if he didn't approach the conversation with empathy or consider her feelings, that's where he could be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction shows she felt criticized and devalued, which can impact the relationship's health.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might depend on the tone and approach. The author's intentions were good, but the method could have been more respectful. The comment about her Instagram content being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" is particularly problematic because it's not only judgmental but also undermines her potential in a different way. It might come off as a put-down rather than a constructive suggestion.\n\nTherefore, while the author's concerns are reasonable, the way he expressed them was hurtful and disrespectful. He should have approached the conversation without belittling her or making negative comments about her content. So, there's a balance between being honest and being kind. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author could have been more considerate in his delivery.\n"
