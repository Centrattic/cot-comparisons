She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that she's about to finish her master's, has never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her wealthy parents, and wants to move in with him but only pay half the rent and bills with the rest from her Instagram affiliate marketing. He's suggesting she get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about financial responsibility and the sustainability of their relationship. He's right that relying solely on an allowance and potentially unstable income from affiliate marketing might not be practical. He's trying to set realistic expectations, which is important for a healthy relationship. If she expects him to cover her expenses when she's not working, that could lead to financial strain on him, even if he makes $70k a year. It's about fairness and shared responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's situation: she's in school, has a support system from her parents, and is trying to leverage her Instagram for income. She might be in a different stage of life where she's not yet ready for a traditional job. The author called her a \"bum\" and used harsh language, which could be seen as disrespectful. Everyone has the freedom to choose their career path, and while the author's advice is practical, the way he expressed it might have been hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are the financial expectations and the communication style. The author's intentions are to ensure they can manage household expenses without relying solely on her parents' money. However, he didn't approach the conversation with empathy. Instead of supporting her in exploring her options, he criticized her, which led to a negative reaction. The girlfriend might feel that her efforts (even if not a traditional job) are being dismissed. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss financial matters honestly but respectfully. The author is right to raise concerns about her financial plan, but the manner in which he did so, using derogatory language and making her feel like a failure, is problematic. The question isn't whether she should get a job, but whether the author was wrong for how he communicated his concerns. \n\nThe allowance from her parents is a key factor. While it's generous, it might not last forever. The author is trying to plan for the future, but his approach might be too harsh. The girlfriend's response is understandable if she feels belittled. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? His intentions might be valid, but the way he delivered his message was disrespectful and hurtful. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, as the method of communication was inappropriate even if the underlying concern was reasonable.\n"
