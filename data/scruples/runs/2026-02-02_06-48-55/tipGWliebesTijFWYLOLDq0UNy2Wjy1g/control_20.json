She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about their financial future and wants their partner to be responsible. They argue that she's not contributing in a sustainable way and that relying on her family's money and Instagram might not be reliable. They also mention that they earn a good income but don't want to support her financially. It's reasonable to want a partner who is financially responsible, especially if they're moving in together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's, not having worked before. Her family provides an allowance, and she's planning to monetize her social media. The author might be coming off as dismissive, especially when they comment on her content. That could hurt her feelings and make her feel criticized. Communication is key here. Maybe the author didn't express their concerns in a supportive way. \n\nBut is the author wrong? They are advocating for financial responsibility. However, the way they communicate it matters. Insulting her choices or implying her Instagram work isn't valid could be harmful. The author's intention might be good, but the approach could be lacking empathy. \n\nAlso, considering that she's moving into a new phase of her life, the author's push for her to get a job is practical. However, it's possible that the author should encourage her to explore options rather than being dismissive. Maybe the author isn't wrong in wanting her to be independent but could have handled the conversation better. \n\nSo, the answer might be a mix of both. But according to the options, it's either A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intentions are valid, but their delivery might be harsh. However, the core issue of financial responsibility isn't wrong. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note that the approach could improve.\n"
