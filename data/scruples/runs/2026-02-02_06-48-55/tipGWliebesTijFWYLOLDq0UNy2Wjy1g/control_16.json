She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy with a girlfriend who's 23 and about to graduate with a master's. She hasn't had a job before, lives with her well-off parents, gets a $1k+ allowance, and wants to move in with him. The key points here are her lack of work experience, reliance on family money, and her plan to use Instagram for income. The author is pushing her to get a job, while she's resistant.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she should work to be financially independent, not rely on her parents' money and unrealistic income from social media. He's concerned about their future financial stability if she doesn't have a steady income. He also mentions that she might expect him to cover expenses, which he's not willing to do. She got upset, feeling judged, and called him names.\n\nNow, to determine if he's wrong. On one hand, he's being realistic. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute financially, especially in a shared living situation. He's not asking her to do something extreme\u2014just a job, maybe minimum wage, which would help. His concerns about financial planning are valid. On the other hand, he criticized her lifestyle choice and made a comment about her content (posts of her body), which could come off as disrespectful. That might have been harsh, even if his intent was to push her towards practicality.\n\nThe question is whether his approach was wrong. While his advice is logical, the way he delivered it\u2014calling her out on not being in the \"real world,\" dismissing her income plan as just posting pictures\u2014could be seen as condescending. People have different career paths, and affiliate marketing isn't inherently invalid. However, his main point about needing a job is sound.\n\nBut the key issue is the tone and the personal attacks. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" in a relationship can be hurtful. He might not be in the wrong for the advice itself, but the way he communicated it could be problematic. However, in the context of a serious relationship discussion about moving in together, financial responsibility is a valid topic. The answer might hinge on whether the criticism was constructive or unnecessarily harsh.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often split between the practical advice and the delivery. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and considering that his main points are valid (financial responsibility, shared expenses), but the delivery had some harsh elements, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. However, there's a middle ground where his tone could be improved. But according to the options, A is if he is wrong, B if not. Given that, the answer is B.\n"
