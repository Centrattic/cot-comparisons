She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about him telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income when moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's concerned about financial responsibility and real-world readiness. His girlfriend hasn't had a job, is moving in with him, and plans to rely on her parents' money and affiliate marketing, which he doubts. He's worried about shared financial responsibilities and the feasibility of her income plan. He's being honest about his expectations, which is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she might feel her aspirations (like growing her Instagram) are valid and that her partner is dismissing her efforts. She could feel criticized or not respected, especially if she's in a program and transitioning to adulthood. The allowance from her family might be a support system, and she might not be ready to take on full-time work yet. The way the author expressed his concerns could have come off as harsh or dismissive, making her feel attacked.\n\nNow, the key points. The author is right to address the financial realities of moving in together. Open communication about finances is crucial. However, the way he delivered his message might have been confrontational. Saying she's a \"bum\" or that her friends are in the real world could be hurtful. It's not just about being right or wrong but how the message is conveyed. He's advocating for responsibility, which is fair, but the tone might have undermined his message.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's career path (masters) might involve internship or part-time work, but if she's not working, that's a point. However, the author's comment about her Instagram content being about her body could be seen as minimizing her efforts or not taking her goals seriously. That's a possible misstep.\n\nIn relationships, how you communicate your concerns matters. While the author has valid points about financial planning, the approach might have caused unnecessary hurt. The question is whether his intentions were reasonable but the delivery was poor, making him at least partially at fault, or if he's justified in his stance.\n\nSo, considering all, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even if his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them could have been more respectful. However, some might argue that B is correct because he's being realistic about their future together. But the hurtful language and dismissal of her plans likely make him at fault.\n"
