She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree, has never had a job, and lives with her well-off parents who give her an allowance. She wants to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The author is against this, urging her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and his girlfriend's lack of work experience. He argues she should get a job to be independent. She's relying on her parents' money and her Instagram, which he doesn't think is reliable. He also made a comment about her content, which might be a problem. The girlfriend felt hurt and called him names, thinking he made her feel like a failure.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. Is it wrong to encourage someone to be more responsible? The author is expressing a valid concern about financial stability. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. The comment about her Instagram content being about \"pics of her ass and tits\" is definitely disrespectful and could be offensive. That's a major issue. Even if his intentions were good, that remark could have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is in a transitional phase, finishing her studies. Maybe she's not ready for the workforce yet. The author might not be considering her feelings or her plans. While pushing for independence is reasonable, the manner in which he did it, including the derogatory comment, could be seen as dismissive of her efforts and aspirations.\n\nFinancial expectations in a relationship are important, but communication is key. The author should have discussed this more maturely, perhaps offering support or understanding her perspective rather than making her feel criticized. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she felt belittled, which might not be necessary if he approached the conversation with empathy.\n\nSo, the author's points about financial responsibility are valid, but the way he expressed them, especially the comment about her Instagram, is problematic. That's where the mistake lies. It's possible to encourage someone without being disrespectful. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for the way he communicated his concerns, even if the concerns themselves are understandable.\n"
