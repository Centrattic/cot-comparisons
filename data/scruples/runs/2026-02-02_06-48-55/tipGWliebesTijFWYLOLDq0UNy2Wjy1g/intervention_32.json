She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend is about to get a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents give her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But when the author asked how she'll cover the costs, she said she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram for affiliate marketing. The author is against this and tells her she needs a job, arguing that she should work and not just rely on her parents or social media. He also mentions that she might expect him to pay the rest, which he's not going to do even though he's earning $70k this year.\n\nThe girlfriend got upset, feeling called out and accused of being a bum. The author is now wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLooking at the situation from both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and their future together. He's right to think about the practicalities of living together and splitting costs. But the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Telling someone they need to get a job and implying they're not being responsible can come off as judgmental, especially if they're in a relationship. The girlfriend might feel hurt because he criticized her lifestyle and her aspirations of using Instagram, which she sees as a valid path. Also, he mentioned her friends and their wealth, which might have made her feel attacked.\n\nHowever, the author is also being realistic. The girlfriend's plan might not be financially feasible long-term. Relying on an allowance and affiliate marketing could be unstable. The author is looking out for their future by encouraging her to be financially independent.\n\nBut in a relationship, communication style matters. Even if the message is about responsibility, the delivery can affect how it's received. The author's comments might have been dismissive of her efforts and aspirations, leading to her feeling belittled. The key is whether he's right to raise valid concerns versus how he expressed them. If he approached it as a discussion and support for her to find a job, maybe it would be better. Instead, he seems to have criticized her lifestyle, which can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering the emotional impact and the way the message was delivered, the author might be in the wrong. The girlfriend has the right to her own path, even if it's unconventional, and the author's condescension could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
