She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society, specifically about her not having a job and relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram account for income.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's finishing her master's, never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents. They're planning to move in together, and she wants to use her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her half of the rent and bills. The author is against this, urging her to get a job. He expresses concerns about her financial stability, her expecting him to cover expenses, and her unrealistic expectations based on her friends' lifestyles. She gets upset and feels he's calling her a bum.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that financial independence is important, especially if they're moving in together. He's concerned about her financial responsibility and possibly his own contributions if she can't cover her share. On the other hand, she's in a graduate program, hasn't worked yet, and comes from a financially stable family. She's relying on her parents' support and her own online income, which might not be reliable.\n\nIs the author wrong to express his concerns? Well, he's voicing his financial expectations for a shared living situation. It's reasonable to discuss financial responsibilities when moving in together. However, the way he communicates his concerns might come across as dismissive or disrespectful. Saying things like \"she's just posting pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as condescending and undermining her efforts. That part of the message is probably unhelpful and could hurt her feelings, even if his intention is to push her towards a more stable income.\n\nAlso, considering her background, she might not have had the same opportunities or pressures to get a job early. The author's friends and her friends have different realities. The author's approach might be too harsh without considering her situation and aspirations. Maybe there's a middle ground where he supports her in finding a job or exploring her Instagram income more seriously, rather than dismissing it outright.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns about financial responsibility, the way he communicated them might have been the issue. Being in a relationship, especially a serious one, requires empathy and collaboration. Telling someone they're not being productive and using a derogatory comment about their content could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how he expressed his concerns, rather than the concerns themselves. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer depends on whether the approach is appropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions might be valid, but his method of communication and some of his comments (like the Instagram remark) are problematic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for the way he handled the situation, even if the underlying concerns are reasonable.\n"
