She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy in a relationship with a woman who's about to finish her master's degree, told her she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and using Instagram for income. The woman got upset and accused him of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about their financial future together. He's worried that relying on an allowance and affiliate marketing isn't stable enough. He wants her to be independent and responsible. On the other hand, the woman might feel that the author is dismissive of her plans and not supportive. She might feel that he's judging her lifestyle, which her family has provided her with, and that he's not respecting her choices.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual support in a relationship. The author's approach might have been harsh. Instead of directly criticizing her for not working, he could have discussed their financial plans more collaboratively. Telling her she's a \"bum\" or that she's not an adult might come off as condescending, especially if she's used to a different lifestyle. The fact that she's transitioned from a supported environment to a more independent one could be a big adjustment, and the author's blunt approach might not help her feel supported.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she wants to use Instagram for income. While that's possible, he's skeptical and calls her posts inappropriate. His comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" might be seen as disrespectful and could have contributed to her feeling attacked. Even if he's concerned about the practicality of her income source, the way he communicates it matters a lot.\n\nFinancial independence is important in a relationship, especially when considering living together. However, how the author approached the conversation might have been too confrontational. He could have expressed his concerns more gently, perhaps suggesting exploring job opportunities alongside her Instagram efforts. The fact that she's getting an education might mean she has academic goals, and transitioning to the workforce can be challenging. The author's lack of support here might be hurtful.\n\nOn the flip side, the author has a valid point about financial stability. Relying on an allowance and uncertain income sources isn't sustainable. He's trying to prepare her for real-world responsibilities, which is a valid concern in a long-term relationship. However, the method of communication is crucial. Being supportive while addressing financial planning is key.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing sensitive topics like finances, communication style is as important as the content. The author might not be in the wrong for having these concerns, but his approach could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, leading to the woman feeling attacked. The right approach would be to find a balance between expressing concerns and supporting each other's goals.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of the way he communicated his concerns, even if his intentions were to support their future together.\n"
