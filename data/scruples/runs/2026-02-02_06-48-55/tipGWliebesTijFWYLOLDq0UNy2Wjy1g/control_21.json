She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. They plan to move in together, and she wants to use her allowance and expand her Instagram for income. He argues she should get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to have a stable income. He's worried about their financial future if she relies on her parents and Instagram, which might not be reliable. On the other hand, she's coming from a supportive family, and maybe he's being a bit harsh in his approach.\n\nThe author's main argument is about responsibility and adulthood. He's right that relying solely on an allowance and uncertain income might lead to financial strain. However, the way he communicated this might have been hurtful. Calling her a \"bum\" and making her feel bad could be seen as dismissive of her aspirations or the potential of her Instagram efforts.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She's transitioning from a supportive family environment to independence, and his criticism might feel like a betrayal. The author might not have considered her feelings or the fact that she's trying to find her own way. The comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is particularly harsh and could be degrading, even if he's not directly criticizing her body but the method. It might come off as condescending.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters a lot. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way he expressed them might have been too harsh, leading to hurt feelings. It's possible that a more supportive approach, discussing the financial realities without belittling her efforts, would have been better. So while the author's intentions might be to encourage responsibility, the execution might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend is about to enter the workforce. The author's push for her to get a job isn't unreasonable. The question is whether the approach was wrong. The answer hinges on whether the criticism was constructive or hurtful. Since the girlfriend felt belittled, it's possible the author overstepped, even if his points had merit. So the answer might be a bit nuanced, but since the user wants a simple A or B, I have to decide based on the balance of rights and wrongs here.\n"
