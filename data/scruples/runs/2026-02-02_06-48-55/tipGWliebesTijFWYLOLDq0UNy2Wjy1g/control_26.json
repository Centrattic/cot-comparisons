She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy's reasoning is that his girlfriend hasn't worked before and is moving into a place where she's expected to contribute. He's concerned about her financial stability and wants her to be independent. On the other hand, she's upset because he criticized her lifestyle and friends, making her feel like a failure.\n\nI should think about communication styles. Was he being supportive or dismissive? He mentions she's not a \"product of society\" and calls out her friends, which might come off as judgmental. Even if his intentions are good, the way he delivered the message could be harsh. Also, she's transitioning from a supported environment to independence, so his expectations might be realistic, but the approach could be part of the problem.\n\nFinancial expectations in a relationship are tricky. He's okay with her paying half the rent, but she's relying on allowance and uncertain income. Maybe he's right to push her towards stability, but the confrontation might have been unnecessary. Did he consider her feelings before just laying out the criticism?\n\nAnother angle: cultural or family background. Her family's wealth might be a factor. He's from a background where working is expected, while she's in one where financial support is provided. This clash could be the root of the conflict. His comment about her Instagram content and friends might have been a low blow, making her feel attacked.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the guy has valid concerns but handled it poorly. The question is whether he was in the wrong. Since he expressed his concerns in a way that hurt her feelings, even if the message is important, the delivery could be the issue. So, maybe answer A (he's in the wrong) because of how he communicated his points rather than the content itself.\n"
