She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let's go through the details.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's finishing her master's and has never worked a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in with him, and she plans to use her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram to make money through affiliate marketing. He argues she should get a job instead, pointing out that relying on her allowance and part-time online work might not be sustainable, and he's worried she'll expect him to cover expenses if she can't make enough. She got upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" and they had a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He's trying to set realistic expectations for their future together. He's right to consider practical aspects like rent and bills. It's reasonable for him to want her to have a stable income, especially if they're moving in together. He's not wrong to express his concerns about her financial plan, given that Instagram income can be unpredictable. He's also voicing his expectation that she contributes fairly, which is fair in a shared living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have come off as harsh. He criticized her lifestyle and implied she's not a \"real adult,\" which could hurt her feelings. He also made a comment about her content, which isn't constructive. The tone might have been more important than the message here. While his intentions are about responsibility, the delivery could have been more supportive. It's possible he didn't mean to make her feel like a failure, but his words did so, which is a common issue in relationships when discussing sensitive topics like money.\n\nFinancial discussions are tough. Even if his points are valid, the approach matters. He might not be wrong in his stance, but the method of communication might be. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. In terms of the content of his message, he's making a valid point about financial stability. But in terms of empathy and communication style, there's room for improvement. \n\nIn many cases, being direct about financial expectations isn't inherently wrong, especially if you're moving in together. However, the way he framed it as her being a \"bum\" and not an adult could be seen as shaming. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive. If he focused on the practicality for their shared future rather than her personal choices, maybe it would have been better received.\n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If we're strictly looking at intentions and the validity of his concerns, maybe not. But if we consider the emotional impact and the way he communicated, perhaps he shares some responsibility. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the main issue is about the content of his message, the answer might lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that communication could be better. But according to typical AITA standards, sometimes being direct about financial matters isn't considered wrong, even if it's delivered poorly. So the answer might be B.\n"
