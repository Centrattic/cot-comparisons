She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy is 22, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her family is well-off, giving her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, but he says she should get a job instead of relying on her allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. He's concerned she won't be able to cover expenses and might expect him to support her. She got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if it's A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. He's expressing concern about his girlfriend's financial independence. He's suggesting she get a job, which is a reasonable expectation if they're moving in together. It's important for both partners to contribute to shared expenses. However, the way he communicated might be an issue. He calls her a \"bum,\" says she's living in an unrealistic world, and criticizes her friends. That sounds harsh and disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the tone and language matter in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has the right to her own financial choices. While not having a job could be seen as a red flag, she has her own plan (Instagram affiliate marketing). The author is dismissing her potential to earn through her platform, which could be valid or not, but he's not supporting her effort. \n\nThe key points are communication style and mutual respect. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way he expressed them (calling her a bum, using derogatory terms about her friends, etc.) is not healthy. Relationships require support and constructive dialogue. Also, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being judgmental without considering her perspective. \n\nSo, the author might be right in wanting her to be financially responsible, but his approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns.\n"
