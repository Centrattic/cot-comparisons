She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become more productive. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and wanting to move in together. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and social media income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main points are about financial stability and responsibility. They're worried that relying on an allowance and uncertain income from Instagram (like affiliate marketing) isn't reliable. They want her to work a traditional job to build a solid financial foundation. That makes sense from a practical standpoint. People often value stability and independence in relationships, especially when it comes to shared expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is important too. She's upset and feels criticized. The author's tone might have been harsh, especially when making comments about her Instagram content focusing on certain body parts. That could come off as disrespectful or dismissive of her efforts. It's possible that she's trying to find her own path, and the author's reaction was too negative, making her feel invalidated.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern, but the way the author communicated their concerns might have been the issue. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or calling their income source unreliable without considering their perspective can be hurtful. The author might be right in wanting financial responsibility, but the approach could have been more supportive. Maybe suggesting alternatives or understanding her goals for Instagram could have been better than outright dismissal.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's background is important. She's from a wealthy family and hasn't worked before. Transitioning to financial independence can be challenging, and the author's approach might not account for her need to adjust gradually. The author might be right to encourage her to work, but the method and tone are crucial in relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are about financial responsibility, the way they expressed it could be seen as harsh and disrespectful. The key is balancing practical advice with empathy and respect for her situation. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the manner in which the criticism was delivered, even if the concern is valid.\n"
