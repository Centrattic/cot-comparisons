She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents are well-off, giving her over a thousand a month in allowance. They're planning to move in together, and the guy expects her to pay half the rent and bills. The problem is that she's planning to rely on her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram for income through affiliate marketing. The author argues that she should get a job instead of just relying on her parents and social media, which doesn't seem sustainable. He's worried she'll struggle financially and might expect him to cover expenses. The girl got upset and felt insulted, feeling like he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that financial independence is important, especially for someone who has never worked. He's concerned about their future financial stability and the fairness of sharing responsibilities. On the other hand, the girl has a master's degree and her parents support her financially. She's planning to monetize her Instagram, which might not be as unrealistic as he thinks. Maybe she has a business plan or a following that can generate income. The author's comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as dismissive and possibly sexist, which might have hurt her feelings. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to encourage his girlfriend to be financially responsible? It might be reasonable to expect her to have a stable income if they're moving in together. However, the way he presented his concerns could be problematic. Criticizing her aspirations and making derogatory remarks about her content might have been harsh. The key here is whether his intentions were constructive or if he was being judgmental. \n\nAlso, considering her background, she might not have had the same work experience, so maybe she's not aware of the financial realities. But does that mean he has the right to tell her she's being irresponsible? Relationships can be a place for honest conversations about finances, but the delivery matters. Insulting her or making her feel like a \"bum\" could damage trust. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that Instagram affiliate marketing isn't viable. While it's true that many people don't make substantial income that way, some do. It's possible she has a strategy, even if the author doesn't see it. Dismissing her potential without understanding her plan might be unfair. \n\nIn terms of moving in together, splitting costs is a typical arrangement. If she can't afford her half through a job or her current allowance, there might be a problem. But it's her choice how she wants to earn money. The author might be overstepping by telling her what to do, even if he's right about the financial risks. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his approach was respectful and constructive. If he's being supportive but concerned, maybe not. But if he's belittling her and not considering her perspective, that's where the issue lies. The derogatory comment about her content is a clear misstep. People have different ways of earning income, and judging her for that could be the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while his concerns about financial responsibility might be valid, the way he expressed them and the judgmental tone likely made him the asshole in the situation. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
