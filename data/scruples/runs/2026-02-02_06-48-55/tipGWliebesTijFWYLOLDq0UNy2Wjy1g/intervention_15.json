She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation. The guy, M22, is in a relationship with his girlfriend, F23, who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. She's getting a $1k+ monthly allowance from her well-off parents. They want to move in together, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But when he asked how she'll cover the costs, she said she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram for affiliate marketing. He pushed her to get a job, saying she needs to be an adult and not just rely on her parents and social media. She got upset, feeling he's being an asshole for making her feel like a bum.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl hasn't worked, is relying on family money, and plans to move in with her partner. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's worried she'll struggle financially and might expect him to cover the costs. \n\nOn one hand, the guy is trying to be responsible. He's not okay with her not having a stable income and potentially burdening their shared living situation. He's encouraging her to get a job, which is a valid concern. But on the other hand, the way he communicated this might have been harsh. He called her out for not working, implying she's being irresponsible, and even criticized her Instagram content. That could come off as dismissive and disrespectful, making her feel attacked. \n\nHer response shows that she felt hurt and devalued. The key here is how the message was delivered. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the approach matters. Telling someone they're not a \"real adult\" and that their way of earning money (like affiliate marketing) is not legitimate might invalidate her efforts and aspirations. Plus, the comment about her Instagram posts being about her body could be seen as objectifying or undermining her work. \n\nAlso, the guy is planning to earn $70k this year but isn't willing to cover her expenses. He wants her to be financially independent, which is fair, but the way he's enforcing it might be too abrupt. Relationships require communication and compromise. Maybe he should have approached the conversation with more empathy, understanding her perspective on affiliate marketing, and discussing practical steps together rather than being confrontational.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy isn't entirely wrong for wanting her to be financially responsible. However, the way he expressed his concerns was inconsiderate, leading her to feel attacked. The \"AITA\" aspect often hinges on both the validity of the concern and the manner in which it's addressed. So, while his intention might be good, the execution was poor, making him at least partially at fault for the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the approach was hurtful and dismissive, even if the intent was to encourage responsibility.\n"
