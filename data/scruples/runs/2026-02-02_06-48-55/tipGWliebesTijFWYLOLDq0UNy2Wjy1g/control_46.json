She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a man in a relationship with a woman who's about to finish her master's but has never worked a job. She relies on her parents' allowance and plans to use her Instagram for income. The author is pushing her to get a job, and she's upset because he criticized her approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main points are about responsibility and financial independence. He's concerned that his girlfriend isn't taking practical steps to support herself, especially since they're planning to live together. Her relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing through social media might not be sustainable, and he's worried about their financial future together. He's also pointing out that if she works even a minimum wage job, she could contribute more and save.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels attacked. She's about to graduate, which is a significant academic achievement. Her using Instagram and affiliate marketing isn't traditional, but maybe she has a different view on what constitutes \"real\" work. She's also coming from a supportive family, which might make her less aware of financial struggles. The author's comments about her content on Instagram (postings of her body) could be seen as dismissive or judgmental, even if he's concerned about financial stability.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's approach was wrong. He's trying to encourage her to be responsible, which is a valid concern for a relationship where they'll share living expenses. However, the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Telling someone they're not acting like an adult and implying they're a \"bum\" could be hurtful. Also, the comment about her Instagram content being objectifying might have added insult to injury, even if his intention was to be practical.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important, but how it's discussed matters. The author's intentions might be good, but the method of expressing his concerns\u2014criticizing her lifestyle choices and making personal comments about her work\u2014could have been inappropriate. Relationships require communication that's both honest and respectful. While he's right to want her to be financially stable, the way he conveyed his message might have crossed a line.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely at fault, but there are elements where he could have approached the conversation differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). The balance here is between his valid concerns and the manner in which he expressed them. Since the core issue is about financial responsibility and moving forward together, and while his approach was harsh, the underlying concern is reasonable. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the judgmental comments about her content and calling her a \"bum\" might tip the scales. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The key point is whether he was wrong. If the main issue is pushing her to be responsible, he's right, but the way he did it was wrong. So AITA would depend on whether the manner is worse than the message. In AITA, sometimes the message is good but the delivery is bad, leading to being \"asshole\" status. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
