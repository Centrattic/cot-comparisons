She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend that she needs to become more productive and get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is 22, his girlfriend 23. She's about to finish her master's, never had a job, gets a $1k+ allowance from her well-off parents. She plans to move in with him, paying half the rent using her allowance and expanding her Instagram for income. He's pushing her to get a job, and she's upset, feeling judged. He mentions she's posting pictures and that he doesn't think she'll make much from that. She's called him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the context. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to be independent. He's right to think about future stability, especially if they live together. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. She's in a different situation, coming from a wealthy family, maybe not used to working. His comments about her Instagram posts being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be offensive and dismissive, even if he's being honest. It's possible he's being supportive by encouraging her to work, but the tone and specific comments might have hurt her feelings unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, she's about to finish her master's, so maybe she's looking to explore her options, and his push for a job might be premature or not considering her plans. Financial discussions in relationships can be tricky. He's not wrong in wanting her to be responsible, but the approach matters. Insensitive remarks can damage the relationship. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves. However, some might argue that he's right to be realistic about her financial situation. But the key is whether he was wrong in the way he expressed it. The term \"pics of her ass and tits\" is particularly rude and could be the main reason she felt attacked. So, AITA would lean towards A, he's in the wrong.\n"
