She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a guy, 22, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's degree but hasn't had a job before. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent with her allowance and trying to make money via Instagram affiliate marketing. He's against that and wants her to get a job. She got upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's argument is practical. He's concerned about financial responsibility. He's making 70k this year, which is decent, but he's not willing to support her financially beyond the rent split. He's pointing out that relying on allowance and Instagram might not be sustainable, and that getting a job would be better for her financial stability. He's being honest about his expectations if they move in together, which is fair. He's not forcing her to move in; he's just setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being dismissive of her plans and not respecting her autonomy. She's pursuing a different path, which is valid, but maybe underestimating the challenges of making money through Instagram. The author's tone might have come off as harsh, especially the part about posting pictures of her body. That could be seen as disrespectful or belittling her efforts, even if his intentions were to be realistic. Also, he's implying that her friends' lack of real-world experience is a problem, which could be a judgment on her social circle.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's being honest about his financial expectations, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been hurtful. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or implying they're a \"dick\" for wanting financial stability isn't constructive. Also, the comment about her Instagram posts could be seen as objectifying her and undermining her potential. While his concerns are valid, the approach taken might have been too harsh or disrespectful.\n\nIt's possible the author is right in the sense that financial responsibility is important, but the manner in which he expressed his views could have been more supportive. Relationships require communication and understanding, and while it's okay to discuss financial expectations, doing so in a way that makes the other person feel attacked is not helpful. So, there's a mix of right and wrong here. The intentions are good, but the execution might have been flawed. Considering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because of how he communicated his concerns rather than the concerns themselves.\n"
