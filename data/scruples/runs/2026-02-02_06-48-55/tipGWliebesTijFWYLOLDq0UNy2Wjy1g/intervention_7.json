She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram income. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is going to finish her master's and hasn't worked a job yet. Her family gives her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But he's concerned that her plan to use her Instagram account for affiliate marketing isn't reliable. He argues she should get a job for stability, mentioning that even minimum wage would help her save money. She feels he's being harsh, calling her a bum and making her feel bad.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she should be more responsible and not depend on her parents or unreliable income sources. He's trying to prepare her for real-world finances. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't had a job yet, maybe because she's been in school, and her family's financial support might have shielded her from needing to work. Her plan to monetize Instagram could be a valid path, but it's uncertain. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean he crossed a line. He expressed his concerns about financial responsibility and their future living situation. He might have been honest but perhaps didn't consider her feelings or the pressure she's under. The way he framed it as her not being an adult and criticizing her friends could be seen as judgmental. \n\nHowever, it's also about expectations in a relationship. If she's moving in, he's within his rights to discuss financial responsibilities. The question is whether his approach was respectful. He might have valid points about financial stability, but the way he communicated it made her feel attacked. That could be where he's in the wrong\u2014maybe not the content of his message, but the delivery.\n\nAlternatively, he's just being realistic. If she's not working, moving in together could lead to financial strain. He's setting boundaries, which is reasonable. But if he's making her feel like a failure, that's unkind. The key is whether his criticism was constructive or hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (in the wrong) if his approach was dismissive of her goals and made her feel bad. Or B (not in the wrong) if he's just being honest about financial expectations. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it as a valid discussion about financial responsibility. Maybe the problem is that he's not supporting her aspirations but instead belittling them. The phrase \"posting pics of her ass and tits\" might have been especially hurtful. That's a bit harsh and could contribute to her feeling attacked. So, the answer might be A.\n"
