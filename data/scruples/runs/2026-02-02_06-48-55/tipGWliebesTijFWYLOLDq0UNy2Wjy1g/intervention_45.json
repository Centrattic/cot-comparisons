She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become productive. First, I need to understand both sides. The guy is M22, his GF is F23, about to get a master's. She's never had a job, gets an allowance from her parents, and wants to move in with him. He's okay with splitting rent but is against her relying on her parents' money and social media income. He's pushing her to get a job.\n\nHe's concerned about financial responsibility. She might be unprepared for the real world, expecting him to cover expenses. He's being honest about the financial reality, which is fair. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends, and made comments about her Instagram posts. That's where the problem might lie.\n\nEven if he's right about the financial aspects, the communication style matters. Insulting her or making her feel like a failure could hurt her feelings. The question is whether the intent (helping her be responsible) justifies the harshness. Relationships require empathy. Maybe he should have expressed the same concerns without the negativity. So while his concerns are valid, his approach might be wrong. Therefore, AITA? The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he conveyed his message, even if the message itself is valid. But some might argue that being honest, even bluntly, is necessary. However, the key is the manner and respect. So I think the answer is A.\n"
