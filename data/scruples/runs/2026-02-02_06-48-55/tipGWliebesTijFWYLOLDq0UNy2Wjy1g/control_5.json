She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a 22-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her masters but has never had a job. Her parents are dentists and accountants, giving her over $1k a month. She wants to move in with him, and he's expecting her to pay half the rent and bills. He's okay with that because they've been together a year and it's a step forward. But when she says she'll use her allowance and expand her Instagram (which she has 8k followers on) to earn money through affiliate marketing, he pushes back. He tells her she needs a job, work like an adult, and that without a job, she'll struggle financially and expect him to cover the costs. He mentions her friends are in similar situations, relying on parents and school, and that they don't see the real world. She got upset, called him an asshole, and felt like a bum.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author is concerned about his girlfriend's financial dependence and future stability. He's suggesting that she get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and social media. On the other hand, she has a masters degree, which is a significant academic achievement, and is planning to monetize her Instagram. Her parents are supporting her, which might be a cultural or family norm. \n\nThe author's argument is about responsibility and adulting. He's worried she's not prepared for the real world, which is valid. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her out for not working and for \"just\" going to school, implying she's not productive. He also made a comment about her Instagram content, which could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her potential.\n\nFinancial independence is important in a relationship, especially when moving in together. However, the girlfriend is in a position where her parents can support her, so the author's concern might be about self-sufficiency. The problem is, he's not the one who's financially dependent. He's making $70k this year, so he's in a better position to support himself and possibly her, but he's not willing to do that without her contributing. That's fair. \n\nBut the way he expressed his concerns\u2014using judgmental language like \"bum,\" \"just go to school for no reason,\" and making a derogatory comment about her content\u2014might have been the issue. Even if his intentions are about her future, the tone and harsh words could have made her feel attacked. Relationships require communication, and while being honest is good, it's important to be respectful and considerate of the other person's feelings and circumstances.\n\nAlso, she's using her Instagram as a potential income source, which is a legitimate way to make money. Telling her she's not making real money by doing that could undermine her efforts. Plus, her family's support might not be something to criticize, especially if they're providing for her while she's in school. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. He's not wrong to want her to be financially independent, but his approach was probably too harsh and condescending. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns, making her feel belittled. The core issue is the communication style rather than the content of what he said. People have different paths to productivity, and his judgmental attitude could harm their relationship. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
