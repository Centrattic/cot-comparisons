She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old guy, and his 23-year-old girlfriend who's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. She's moving in with him, and he's concerned about her financial independence.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family is well-off, giving her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She plans to use that to cover half the rent and bills, and also expand her Instagram for affiliate marketing income. The author is against this, telling her she needs a real job. He argues that relying on her parents and expecting him to cover expenses isn't fair, even though he's earning $70k. She's upset, feeling he's being harsh and making her feel like a failure.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. From a logical standpoint, the author is concerned about financial responsibility and long-term stability. It's reasonable for him to want his partner to be financially independent, especially if they're moving in together. Her relying solely on family allowance and uncertain Instagram income might not be sustainable. He's setting boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the way he communicated this might be an issue. The tone of his message could come off as dismissive or judgmental, especially mentioning her posts and implying her methods aren't viable. That might have been hurtful. People can have valid concerns but express them in a way that's supportive rather than critical.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's approach to financial planning is risky. Affiliate marketing isn't guaranteed, and relying on family money indefinitely isn't sustainable. The author has the right to express his concerns, especially if they're moving in together and sharing financial responsibilities.\n\nBut relationships require empathy. The author might have focused on the facts without considering her feelings. It's possible he's right about the practicality, but the delivery could have been more compassionate. However, the core issue is about financial responsibility, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If his intentions are good and the criticism is about real-world preparedness, then maybe not. But if he was harsh without considering her situation, maybe a bit. But overall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's advocating for financial responsibility, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
