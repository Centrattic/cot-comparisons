She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author of the post, a man, telling his girlfriend that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's and has no work experience. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and the girlfriend's lack of awareness about real-world financial struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is advocating for financial independence and responsibility, which is generally seen as a positive trait. He's concerned about their future living arrangements and the feasibility of her relying solely on her parents' money and Instagram, which might not be stable. His intention seems to be to prepare her for the real world and ensure that she can contribute equally to their shared expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being harsh and judgmental. She might perceive his comments as undermining her efforts and her lifestyle. Since she comes from a well-off family and hasn't had to work a traditional job, she might not see the necessity of getting a job right away. The author's criticism of her Instagram content, specifically mentioning \"pics of her ass and tits,\" could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, even if it's meant to highlight impracticality.\n\nFinancial discussions can be sensitive in relationships. The author's approach might have been too direct or harsh, leading to the girlfriend feeling belittled. While his intentions might be valid, the way he communicated his concerns could have been more supportive. Instead of calling her lazy or a \"bum,\" he might have approached the conversation by expressing his worries about their future together and suggesting practical steps she could take.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author is in a position where he's planning to move in with her and expects her to cover her half of the rent. His concern about her being able to manage financially is valid, but he might be projecting his own values onto her without considering her circumstances. Her family's financial support gives her a safety net that he might not have had. It's possible that the author is imposing his own expectations without fully understanding her situation or giving her the credit for figuring out her own path.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her friends are in similar situations, so she might not see anything wrong with her current lifestyle. His criticism could feel like an attack on her social circle and upbringing. In relationships, it's important to communicate in a way that respects both partners' backgrounds and experiences.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong to want financial security for both of them. However, the manner in which he expressed his concerns might have been damaging. He could have been more collaborative, discussing options and supporting her in exploring different ways to become financially independent, rather than making her feel like a failure for not meeting his standards.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer isn't black and white. The author has valid concerns about financial responsibility, but the way he addressed them could have been more empathetic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the harsh communication style, even if his intentions were good.\n"
