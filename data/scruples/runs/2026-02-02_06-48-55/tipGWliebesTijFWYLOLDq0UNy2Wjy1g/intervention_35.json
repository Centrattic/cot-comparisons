She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the man) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 23, about to graduate with a master's, never had a job, and gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent and bills. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author thinks she should get a real job, mentions she might struggle financially, and even comments on her content (posting pictures of herself). She got upset and called him names.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author's concern is valid in that he wants financial stability and responsibility. He's planning to save, but she's relying on allowance and social media. However, his approach might have been harsh. He criticized her choices, called her a \"bum,\" and made a comment about her content, which could be hurtful. \n\nIs it his place to dictate how she should earn money? While financial responsibility is important, his tone and judgment might have been unkind. Maybe he should have discussed it more collaboratively instead of shaming her. Also, considering her family's support, she might not be in a rush to work, but it's reasonable for the author to want her to be independent. However, the way he communicated his concerns, including the comment about her Instagram content, was probably inconsiderate. \n\nSo, even if his intentions are good, the method could be problematic. People might feel pressured or criticized, especially when they're in a relationship. The key is whether the criticism was constructive. It seems more like a personal attack here. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the way he expressed his concerns rather than the content itself.\n"
