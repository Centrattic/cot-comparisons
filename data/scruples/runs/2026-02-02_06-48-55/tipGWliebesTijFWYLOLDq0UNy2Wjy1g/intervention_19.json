She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 22, his girlfriend 23. She's about to get her master's and has never worked a job. Her family is wealthy, giving her over $1k a month. They want to move in together, and he expects her to pay half the rent and bills. She suggests using her allowance and expanding her Instagram for affiliate marketing. He tells her she should get a job, mentions her not being in the real world, and implied that her content (posting pics of her body) isn't a reliable income source. She got upset and called him names. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a common concern. He's asking her to contribute to shared living costs, which is reasonable. He's concerned about her relying on allowance and potentially unstable income from social media, which is valid. However, his approach seems harsh. Telling her she's not being an \"adult\" and calling her a \"bum\" might be dismissive and hurtful. Also, he made assumptions about her expectations, like her thinking he'd cover the expenses, which she might not have said explicitly. \n\nCommunication style is important here. Instead of being confrontational, a more supportive approach would be better. Suggesting that she should work for a living isn't inherently wrong, but the way he delivered it, using judgmental language and possibly belittling her aspirations, could be the issue. Her feelings matter too; she's in a vulnerable position and might feel criticized for her lifestyle. \n\nAlso, her content for Instagram isn't necessarily \"just her ass and tits\"\u2014maybe she's into fitness, fashion, etc., which can be legitimate fields. Dismissing her potential as an affiliate marketer (while it's a valid concern) without considering her perspective might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to set boundaries for their living arrangement, which is responsible. But the way he expressed it could be seen as condescending. The answer probably hinges on whether his intentions were right but the delivery was poor. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a realistic plan, but his tone and words might have been too harsh. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If his advice is well-meaning but delivered in a hurtful way, some might say he overstepped. Others might support his stance on financial responsibility. But given the way he phrased it, especially the part about her content, it's likely that his approach was more of the problem than the actual suggestion. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might be in the wrong for not taking the situation seriously, but the guy's method of addressing it is the issue here. So, in the context of the question, the author might be in the wrong for the way he communicated, even if his concerns are valid. That would lean towards A. But if the main point is about the content of his message (encouraging her to get a job, which is reasonable), then maybe B. It's tricky. \n\nI think the key is that while his intentions were good, the way he said it was harsh and possibly devaluing her efforts or potential. So, he's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe partially. However, the question is binary. AITA is about whether he's the asshole. The term \"asshole\" is used in the question, so if the community would side with the girlfriend, he's the AITA. \n\nConsidering the dynamics, he's not wrong for wanting her to be financially independent, but the condescending language and making her feel like a bum is definitely on the wrong side. So, probably A. But some might argue B because it's a valid concern. However, the way he undermined her efforts and made a comment about her content being \"pics of her ass and tits\" (even if he's not explicitly saying they're bad) could be seen as disrespectful. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
