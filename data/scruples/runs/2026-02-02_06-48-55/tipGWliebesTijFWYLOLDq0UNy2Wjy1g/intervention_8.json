She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the guy (M22) and his girlfriend (F23) who's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. She gets an allowance from her parents, wants to move in with him, and plans to cover her half of the rent and bills with that allowance plus affiliate marketing through her Instagram. The guy is against her relying on her parents and not getting a job, so he confronts her about it. She gets upset, feeling he's calling her a bum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He's right to think that relying on an allowance might not be sustainable long-term, especially if they move in together. But he's also making some assumptions about her ability to make money through Instagram and her friends' lifestyles. He criticizes her for not working, which could come off as dismissive of her plans. \n\nHer part: She's coming from a family that supports her, and she's planning to use her Instagram (which she's built) for affiliate marketing. While that might not be traditional, it's a valid income source for some people. The guy's comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is a bit harsh and could have been hurtful. Even if he's trying to be realistic, that line might have crossed into being condescending or disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is trying to set boundaries and encourage responsibility. It's important in a relationship that both partners are on the same page about finances and life goals. If she's expecting him to cover her expenses because she's struggling, that could lead to issues. His concern about her financial situation is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been too harsh or judgmental. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. He's right to want her to be financially independent, but the way he expressed it, especially the comment about her Instagram content, was probably not respectful. The key here is the tone and the specific remarks that made her feel attacked. Even if his intentions were good, the method could be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the harsh comments and the way he made her feel. But others might argue that he's in the right to express his concerns. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the disrespectful communication likely outweighs the valid concern.\n"
