She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The girlfriend has a master's degree but no work experience, relies on her parents' allowance, and plans to use Instagram affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is concerned about their financial future if they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is M22, she's F23. They've been together nearly a year. The author is earning around $70k, which is a decent salary. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's but hasn't worked. Her family is wealthy, giving her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She wants to move in, but she expects her allowance and Instagram to cover the costs. The author feels this isn't realistic and wants her to get a job. \n\nThe author's arguments are based on financial practicality. He's worried about her financial independence and wants her to be responsible. He's not taking over her expenses, which is fair. He's pushing her to work, which is reasonable because relying on family and social media might not be sustainable. However, his tone might be harsh. Phrases like \"she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult\" and calling her a \"bum\" could be hurtful. He also makes a comment about her Instagram content, which might come off as condescending.\n\nThe girlfriend got upset because he made her feel like a failure. She's probably used to a life of financial support and isn't ready to face the realities of working. The author's approach might be valid in terms of content (she should work), but the delivery could be improved. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the core issue is whether his advice is justified. Financial responsibility is important, so he's not wrong in the fact that she should work. However, the way he delivered the message might have been insensitive. The question is whether the content of his message is wrong. Since he's encouraging a realistic approach to finances, maybe he's in the right. But if the method is inconsiderate, that's where the problem lies. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the method. The content of his message is about her financial responsibility, which is a valid concern. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's an ethical angle where he's overstepping. Since they're a couple planning to live together, discussing finances is necessary. He's not forcing her to take a job, just advising her. So maybe B is correct.\n"
