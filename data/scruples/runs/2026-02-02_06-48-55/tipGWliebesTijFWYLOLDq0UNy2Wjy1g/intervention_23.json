She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe user is a 22-year-old guy who's in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to graduate with a master's degree. She's never had a job before and gets around $1k a month from her parents, who are a dentist and an accountant. They're planning to move in together, and the guy is okay with her paying half the rent. However, when he asked how she'll cover the rent and bills, she said her allowance will cover half and she'll expand her Instagram (with 8k followers) to make money through affiliate marketing. The guy is against that, telling her she needs a real job and to work in the real world. He mentions that even a minimum wage job would give her a better income, and he's worried she'll struggle financially and might expect him to cover her expenses. He also comments on her using Instagram for \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which upset her. She felt he made her feel like a bum and called him an asshole. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author (the guy) in the wrong? Answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nLet me break it down. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. He wants his partner to have a stable income, not rely on an uncertain source like affiliate marketing through Instagram. He's trying to set boundaries, like her paying half the rent. His criticism is about her not being productive, not working, and living off her parents. However, he also made a comment about her using Instagram for explicit content, which is derogatory and objectifies her. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman has a master's degree and hasn't worked, but her family supports her. She's planning to move in and contribute half the rent, but she's relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. The guy is right to question the sustainability of that plan, especially if she's not working. Her Instagram income is uncertain, and relying on a part-time or unstable income might not be realistic. However, the way he communicated his concerns was harsh and disrespectful, especially with the comment about her body. That's likely what made her feel disrespected and upset.\n\nSo, the guy's intentions might be about financial responsibility and wanting her to be independent, which is valid. But his method of expressing that\u2014calling her a \"bum,\" using derogatory language about her content, and overall being dismissive of her plans\u2014could be wrong. It's possible he's right about the need for a job but wrong in how he communicated it. \n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing sensitive topics like money, communication is key. Being honest is important, but doing so in a way that's respectful and supportive is better. The guy's approach might have been too harsh and could have been more constructive. For example, instead of criticizing her Instagram use, he could have discussed the financial risks and offered to find a job with her or support her in a more positive way.\n\nBut then, is it his responsibility to tell her she needs a job? He's planning to move in, so it's reasonable for him to have concerns about shared financial responsibilities. Her relying on her parents might not be sustainable long-term, and he's correct that even a part-time job would add to her income. However, the way he presented this made her feel attacked rather than supported. \n\nSo, the question is whether his intentions matter. If he's right about the need for her to have a job, but wrong in how he went about it, is he in the wrong? Or is it acceptable to be honest, even if it's harsh?\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, being honest is important, but it's also about respect and empathy. The comment about her Instagram posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" is objectifying and probably hurtful. Even if his intention was to encourage her to find a real job, the way he phrased it could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAdditionally, the guy mentions that he's on track to make $70k this year, so he might not be in a position where he's struggling, but he's still concerned about her financial stability. His point about her not working and expecting him to cover expenses could be valid if that's his concern. However, he's the one who agreed to her paying half the rent, so if she can't cover her half, it's a problem. \n\nIn summary, the guy has valid concerns about financial responsibility and his partner's lack of a steady income. However, the way he communicated these concerns was disrespectful and hurtful, leading to her feeling attacked. So, while his intentions might be understandable, his approach was wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong for the way he expressed his concerns, even if the concerns themselves have some merit.\n"
