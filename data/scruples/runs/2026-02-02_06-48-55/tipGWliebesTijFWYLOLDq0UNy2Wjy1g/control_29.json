She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy whose girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's degree and has never had a job before. Her parents are well-off, giving her over $1,000 a month in allowance. They want to move in together, and the author wants her to pay half the rent. When he asks how she'll cover her share, she says her allowance will cover half the rent and bills, and she plans to make money through expanding her Instagram (which has 8k followers) via affiliate marketing. The author is against this, telling her she needs a real job, to become a productive member of society, and that relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing isn't enough. He also mentions that if she moves in, he won't cover her expenses, even though he's on track to make $70k. He criticizes her lifestyle, saying she's not in the real world and that her friends are similarly sheltered. She got upset, felt like a bum, and called him an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and wants his girlfriend to be independent. He's worried that relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing (which he doesn't believe is viable) isn't a sustainable or responsible approach. He's also setting boundaries by not wanting to cover her expenses if she moves in. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being judgmental and dismissive of her plans. She's about to graduate with a master's, which is a significant achievement. She's also in a position where her family supports her, so maybe she has the freedom to explore different income streams. The author's comments about her Instagram content (posts of her \"ass and tits\") might come off as disrespectful or belittling, which could have contributed to her feeling hurt.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong. Is it wrong to encourage financial responsibility? It's generally seen as a good thing to promote independence and practicality. However, the way the author delivered his message might be problematic. He criticized her lifestyle and implied that she's not contributing as an adult, which could be harsh. Also, his comment about her Instagram content and her friends being in the same boat might be condescending. The key here is whether the criticism was justified in terms of content and delivery. \n\nIt's possible that the author has valid concerns about their financial future together. If she's not earning a stable income, moving in together with her expecting to cover half the rent via allowance and affiliate marketing might not be feasible. However, the way he expressed these concerns\u2014by calling her a \"bum,\" implying she's not productive, and making comments about her Instagram posts\u2014could have been hurtful and dismissive of her efforts and her situation. The girlfriend's reaction of feeling insulted and being called names by her suggests that the communication was not respectful.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that affiliate marketing via Instagram isn't viable. While it's true that making significant income from that can be challenging, especially starting out, it's not impossible, and the author's dismissal of her plan might be premature. He might not have considered her potential or the time it takes to build that income. Also, her family's support allows her the time to pursue that, so maybe she's in a position to take that risk.\n\nIn relationships, especially when discussing financial matters, it's important to communicate concerns without belittling the other person. The author's approach seems to be more about lecturing rather than collaborating. He might have been better off discussing practical steps together, like looking for part-time jobs she could take while building her Instagram business, or creating a financial plan that both agree on. Instead, his tone and choice of words led to conflict and hurt feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intentions might be understandable, but his delivery and the specific comments (like the Instagram remark and calling her a \"bum\") are likely where he went wrong. He could have addressed the financial concerns in a more supportive and respectful manner, rather than being critical and judgmental. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated his concerns, even if his intentions were about promoting responsibility.\n"
