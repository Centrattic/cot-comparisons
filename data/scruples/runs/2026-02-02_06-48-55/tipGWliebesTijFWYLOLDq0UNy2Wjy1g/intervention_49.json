She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The scenario is that she's graduating with a master's but hasn't worked, lives with her parents who give her an allowance, and wants to move in with him. He's pushing her to get a job instead of relying on her parents and trying to monetize her Instagram with affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's situation: she's had financial support from her family, hasn't worked, and now the guy wants her to take responsibility. He's not wrong to express concerns about her financial independence, especially since they're planning to live together. He's worried that her current plan (allowance plus Instagram) might not be sustainable. \n\nBut how he communicated it might be an issue. He criticized her for not working, called her a \"bum,\" and made derogatory comments about her content. That's harsh. Even if he's right about the financial practicality, the way he approached it could have been more supportive. Relationships often require empathy and collaboration. Being confrontational and using derogatory language can hurt feelings and create conflict. \n\nAlso, her family's financial support is a factor. She might not have had the same opportunities or pressures as others. His judgment about her friends and their lifestyles might not be fair either. Maybe he's projecting his own values onto her without considering her background.\n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be responsible about their future. Financial stability is important, and he's not wrong to want her to contribute fairly. However, the method of communication and the tone he used are problematic. Instead of being supportive and helping her find a job, he criticized her and dismissed her plans. That could be why she felt attacked.\n\nSo, the author has valid concerns but handled the situation poorly. The answer is probably A because of the harshness and lack of support in his approach.\n"
