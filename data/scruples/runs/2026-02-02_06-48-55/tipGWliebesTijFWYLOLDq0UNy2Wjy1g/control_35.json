She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old guy, is in a relationship with his 23-year-old girlfriend. She's about to finish her master's degree and has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ monthly allowance. They're planning to move in together, and she wants to use her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover her half of the rent and bills. The author tells her she needs to get a job instead because relying on her parents and social media isn't sustainable. She got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the author is concerned about financial responsibility. He's right to think that relying on an allowance and potentially unreliable income (like affiliate marketing) might not be sustainable. He's also pointing out that without a job, she might struggle financially once they move in. His intentions seem to be about preparing her for reality, which is a valid concern, especially when planning to live together. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She's been in school, hasn't worked before, and now she's transitioning into a new phase. The author's approach might have come off as harsh, especially calling her a \"bum\" and criticizing her for relying on her body in her Instagram content. That could be hurtful and dismissive of her aspirations. Even if he's right about the practical aspects, the way he communicated his concerns might have been too confrontational, leading to her feeling attacked.\n\nFinancial independence is crucial for a healthy relationship, especially when cohabiting. The author is right to emphasize that. However, the method he used to communicate this\u2014maybe being too direct and using derogatory language\u2014could have been inappropriate. It's possible that a more supportive approach, discussing her plans and offering help to explore other options, might have been better received. \n\nAlso, considering her background, she's coming from a family where financial support is available. The author might not have considered that she's used to a different lifestyle and transitioning to financial independence is a significant step for her. His criticism about her friends and their lifestyles might also be a sensitive point, as it implies she's not as responsible as others, which can hurt her feelings.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about financial responsibility and independence, the way he expressed them might have been too harsh, leading the girlfriend to feel criticized and devalued. The key issue here is communication style and emotional support versus the practical advice. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for his intentions, but the manner in which he delivered his message could have been improved. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the approach was wrong. If the problem is the content (the advice) versus the delivery (the way he said it), then the answer might be A (yes) or B (no). Given that the content of his advice is reasonable but the delivery was poor, leading to emotional harm, the answer is likely A. But some might argue that the advice is necessary and the delivery is part of the communication. However, in relationship contexts, how you say things is as important as what you say. So, considering the emotional impact, the author might be in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if the concerns were valid.\n"
