She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is a guy who's in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy, and she gets an allowance. They're planning to move in together, and he wants her to get a job to contribute. She's relying on her parents' money and affiliate marketing through Instagram, which he's skeptical about.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. He's expressing concerns about their financial future and wants her to be responsible. However, the way he communicated these concerns might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" used derogatory language about her content, and criticized her lifestyle, which likely hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, his concerns are valid. Financial independence is important, and relying solely on an allowance and uncertain income sources (like affiliate marketing) could lead to instability. However, the way he presented these concerns wasn't constructive. Instead of supporting her in finding a realistic path, he criticized her and her friends, which could be seen as dismissive of her aspirations.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is also important. She might feel that her contributions (like managing her Instagram, which could be a valid business) are undervalued. The comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is not only disrespectful but undermines her efforts. It's possible she's trying to build a legitimate business, even if it's unconventional. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to approach disagreements with empathy and collaboration. The author's approach was confrontational and judgmental, which likely caused the conflict. While his intentions might be to encourage responsibility, the method was tactless. Therefore, he's in the wrong primarily because of the way he communicated his concerns, not the concerns themselves.\n"
