She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author advising his girlfriend to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree and has never worked a job before. She's getting a significant allowance from her parents, who are both professionals. The author is concerned about her financial stability and wants her to transition into the real world by getting a job. He's worried that relying on her parents and affiliate marketing (which might not be reliable) isn't sustainable. \n\nThe author's intentions seem to come from a place of caring about her future and their shared financial responsibilities. He's not okay with her not contributing properly to their shared living costs and wants her to be independent. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He criticized her for \"posting pics of her ass and tits,\" which could be seen as disrespectful and degrading, regardless of her actual content. That part definitely sounds like it could have hurt her feelings and made her feel belittled.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important. She felt like a \"bum\" and called him names, indicating that his approach might have been too confrontational or dismissive of her feelings. Even if his intentions are good, the manner in which he delivered his message could be problematic. The author might not have considered her perspective or the emotional impact of his words. \n\nOn the other hand, it's reasonable for the author to want his partner to be financially responsible, especially if they're planning to live together. It's a valid concern that relying on an allowance and uncertain income from social media isn't a stable plan. However, the way he addressed it might have been more about asserting his views rather than collaborating on a solution.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's right to be concerned about her financial independence, but his approach\u2014calling her a \"bum\" and making degrading comments about her content\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The key here is the balance between being supportive and being critical. The author might have aimed to be helpful but crossed a line in his delivery. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance here. However, given the standard of AITA, if someone's actions, even with good intentions, are disrespectful, they might be considered in the wrong.\n"
