She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and wanting to move in with the author while using her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is valid because financial independence is important in a relationship, especially when living together. However, the way the author communicated this might be the issue. He called her a \"bum\" and mocked her Instagram content, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the intention was to encourage her, the tone and choice of words might have been harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend has a right to pursue her own path, and while the author has valid points about financial responsibility, he shouldn't dictate her life choices in a demeaning way. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or just hurtful. The author might not be wrong in the sentiment but is definitely wrong in the delivery. Relationships require mutual respect, and belittling someone's aspirations, even if they're unrealistic, can damage trust and feelings.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of wanting stability, the manner in which he expressed his concerns was inappropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
