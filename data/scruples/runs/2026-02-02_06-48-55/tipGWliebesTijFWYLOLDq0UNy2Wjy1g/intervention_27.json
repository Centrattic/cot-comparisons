She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting to his girlfriend that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and using her Instagram for income. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is M22, his girlfriend is F23, about to graduate with a master's. She hasn't worked a job before, gets a $1k+ monthly allowance, and wants to move in with him, paying half the rent. He argues she should get a job for financial stability, while she wants to rely on her parents and affiliate marketing via Instagram.\n\nHe's concerned about her financial independence and future. He's worried that without a job, she'll be struggling financially after covering rent and bills, and he doesn't want to support her. His reasoning is that she's in a privileged position due to her family's wealth and her social circle, which might not have exposed her to the real-world necessity of working. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels judged as a \"bum.\" Her approach to making money through Instagram, even if it's seen as superficial (like posting pictures), is her own choice. The author's criticism of her method, especially mentioning \"pics of her ass and tits,\" might come off as disrespectful or dismissive of her efforts.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect, communication, and differing values. The author is advocating for financial responsibility, which is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" or implying her chosen method of income is unserious could hurt her feelings and undermine her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's right to choose how to use her time and resources, even if it's not traditional, is important. She might have her own reasons for not wanting a traditional job, and the author's insistence could be seen as controlling. However, the author's concern about financial stability and shared responsibility in a relationship is also reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to balance honesty with kindness. While the author's intentions might be to protect their future together, the way he expressed his concerns was confrontational. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she felt attacked rather than supported. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix. The criticism of her financial approach might be valid, but the manner in which it was delivered could be seen as disrespectful. The author's right to express his concerns is there, but the delivery might have crossed a line. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the harsh communication style and dismissive attitude towards her chosen path, even if the underlying concerns are somewhat valid.\n"
