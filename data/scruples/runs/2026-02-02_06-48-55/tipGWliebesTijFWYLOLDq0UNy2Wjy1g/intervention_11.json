She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never worked a job. She's getting a $1k+ allowance from her parents and plans to use that plus her Instagram affiliate marketing to cover half the rent. The author thinks she should get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future. They want her to be responsible and not rely on her parents or potentially unreliable income from social media. But is it appropriate to pressure a partner to make career decisions?\n\nThe girlfriend is in a transition phase. She's finishing her education and looking to move in with her partner. The author's advice is well-intentioned, but maybe it's dismissive of her aspirations. She might see affiliate marketing as a valid career path, especially with her existing platform. The author's comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be seen as condescending, even if they're her own body. That might have hurt her feelings because it undermines her efforts and self-esteem.\n\nAlso, the author is imposing their own values on her. Financial responsibility is important, but everyone's path is different. Maybe she's trying to leverage her skills and audience for income, which is a valid approach. The author's insistence on a traditional job might not consider her unique circumstances or goals.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt criticized and devalued. The author might have not considered how their advice came across as judgmental. Relationships require support and understanding, so the way the author presented their concerns might have been harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions are good, but the method and tone could be problematic. Advising someone to become more financially independent isn't inherently wrong, but the delivery here might have been disrespectful. The key is whether the author's approach was supportive or dismissive. Since the girlfriend's plan is unconventional and the author's criticism included personal jabs, it's possible the author overstepped.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach was hurtful and dismissive of her plans, even if their concerns are valid.\n"
