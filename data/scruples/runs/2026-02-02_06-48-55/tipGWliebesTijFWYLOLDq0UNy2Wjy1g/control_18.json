She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let me read through the situation again to get all the details right.\n\nSo, the author is a 22-year-old guy with a girlfriend who's 23. She's about to get her master's degree and has never had a job. Her parents are financially stable, giving her over $1k a month. They're planning to move in together, with the girlfriend paying half the rent. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is against this, thinking she should work a real job for stability and savings. He's concerned about financial strain and that she might expect him to cover costs. The girlfriend got upset, feeling called out as a bum.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions. He's trying to plan their future together. He's thinking about financial stability and wants her to have a sustainable income. It's reasonable for someone in a committed relationship to discuss financial responsibilities, especially if they're moving in together. The girlfriend's approach relies on allowance and uncertain income from Instagram. The author is concerned about this being unreliable and leading to financial issues later. \n\nBut how did he communicate this? He told her she needs to get a job, called her out for not working, and mentioned her friends' situations. The girlfriend felt insulted and called a \"bum.\" The way he presented his concerns might have come off as harsh or disrespectful, even if his concerns are valid. \n\nFinancial planning is important, but the method of communication matters. The author might be right about the practical aspects, but if he didn't approach the conversation with empathy, that's a problem. Healthy relationships involve compromise and support. Insulting or belittling the other person's aspirations, even if they seem unrealistic, can damage the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's plan to use Instagram for income might not be feasible, but it's her to decide how to approach her career. The author could have expressed his concerns without making her feel attacked. Also, expecting her to have a job for financial stability isn't unreasonable, but the way he framed it as her being a \"bum\" and criticizing her friends' lifestyle might be where he went wrong. \n\nIn terms of the question: Is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his criticism was constructive or not. If he was advising for their shared future and financial health, that's understandable. But if he did it in a condescending way, then yes, he's in the wrong. The key points are the author's intentions, the method of communication, and the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (yes) because he hurt her feelings and might have been condescending, even if his concerns are valid. Alternatively, B (no) if the concerns are valid and the advice is reasonable. But the way he expressed it matters more here. The line between advice and criticism is thin. Since the girlfriend felt attacked, the author's approach was off, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
