She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the guy is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that his girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, gets an allowance from her parents, wants to move in with him but pay half the rent using her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. He's pushing her to get a job, and she's upset, feeling called out.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points. He's concerned about her financial independence and their future together. She relies on her parents' allowance and wants to use Instagram for income. He's not supportive of that plan, thinking it's not reliable. He's pushing her to get a job, which he sees as necessary for adult life. She feels he's being harsh, making her feel like a bum.\n\nIs he right to be concerned? Financial stability is important, especially if they're moving in together. If she's not working, she might not contribute as expected, leading to potential conflicts over who pays for what beyond rent. He's also pointing out that relying on allowance and maybe unstable income from Instagram isn't practical. But his approach might have been too direct or harsh. Telling someone they need to \"become a productive member of society\" can come off as judgmental, especially if they're not in a position to work right away.\n\nHer perspective: She's finishing a master's, which is a valid pursuit. Maybe she's planning to use her education later. She might not have considered that without a job, her financial situation would be tight. Also, moving out and starting a job is a big transition, and she might feel unprepared. His comments about her using Instagram for affiliate marketing, and implying it's not real work (calling out her content) could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts.\n\nHe's on track to earn $70k, but he's not willing to support her financially beyond the rent split. That's fair if they're splitting expenses equally, but if her income is minimal, she might still expect some support beyond her share of the rent. His approach might not account for her emotional attachment to her freedom and the stress of entering the job market post-graduation.\n\nHe's not wrong to be concerned about financial sustainability, but his delivery was harsh. He could have approached the conversation more empathetically, acknowledging her situation while expressing his concerns. Blaming her for not being in the real world and criticizing her friends' lifestyles might come off as condescending. The key is whether his intentions were valid (yes) but the method was flawed (yes). Therefore, he's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong at all. Since he's expressing valid concerns about their future and her financial responsibility, but did so in a way that hurt her feelings, maybe it's a mix. But the answer options are A or B. In the AITA context, often the person is considered in the wrong if their actions were unnecessarily harsh or dismissive. His comments about her relying on her parents and the Instagram remark might cross the line. So maybe A is the answer here. Hmm. It's a tough call. But given that he's pushing for financial responsibility, which is valid, but the way he communicated it was hurtful. So the answer might be A because he's right in the concern but wrong in the delivery. Alternatively, B because the concerns are valid. I think in AITA posts, the community often looks at intent and impact. His intent was to encourage responsibility, but the impact was hurtful. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but the answer might be B (no). But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B, then he's not in the wrong. If the answer is A, he is. Let me check similar AITA scenarios. Usually, if someone calls out a partner for financial irresponsibility, but does so in a harsh way, the community might say they're not wrong because financial responsibility is important, but they should handle it more sensitively. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the concerns are valid, even if the delivery was poor. Alternatively, if the community considers the way he spoke to her as harsh and dismissive, then A. I think in this case, the answer might be B because the core issue is about financial responsibility and future planning, which is a valid concern, even if the communication could have been softer. So the answer is B.\n"
