She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy, 22, and his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's and has never worked a job. Her parents give her over $1,000 a month, and she wants to move in with him. He's okay with her paying half the rent and bills, but he's concerned because she plans to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) to make money through affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. He told her she needs to work and become productive, which made her upset. She said he made her feel like a bum and used harsh language.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is worried about financial stability. He's on track to make $70k this year, which is good, but he's not willing to cover all the expenses if they move in. He's suggesting she get a job for real income, which is a common expectation. However, he's also being critical of her using Instagram, especially mentioning the content (posts of her body). That seems a bit dismissive and maybe rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's situation isn't clear. Her parents support her financially, and she's transitioned from school to a plan that relies on social media. While that might be a valid path for some, the author is concerned about her ability to sustain income through that method. But he's not giving her credit for her own ideas, and his tone might have been harsh. Also, he's making assumptions about her not contributing, even though she's offered to pay half the rent and bills. The part where he says she's living off her parents' money and friends with similar backgrounds is a bit judgmental, which could have hurt her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and respect. The author has a right to want a stable living situation and expects her to contribute fairly. However, the way he communicated his concerns\u2014calling her a bum, using derogatory terms for her Instagram content, and being dismissive of her plans\u2014might have been the problem. Even if his intentions are good, the approach can come off as belittling. People might have different paths to financial independence, and while a job is traditional, affiliate marketing through social media can be a legitimate source of income, especially if she has the skills and platform to do so.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting her to be financially independent, but the way he expressed it, combined with the judgment of her chosen method, could be seen as disrespectful. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values, but in the context of a relationship, communication style and support are crucial. If he's undermining her efforts or making her feel ashamed without constructive feedback, that's where he might be in the wrong. But if he's genuinely concerned about their shared financial future and expressed that in a way that's considered honest, maybe not. However, the harsh language and the implication that her Instagram content is not valid (especially the part about her body) is likely to be where the issue lies.\n"
