She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. She's getting an allowance from her well-off parents and plans to use that plus her Instagram for income when moving in with him. The author is pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial stability and independence. He's worried that relying on allowance and Instagram might not be enough, and he wants her to be responsible. On the other hand, he's criticized her for not working and called her a \"bum,\" which might be harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She has a master's degree and might be in a field that allows her to monetize her Instagram. Maybe she's planning to use her skills or the platform effectively. The author's approach might have been too confrontational, making her feel attacked instead of supported. His comment about her posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts, even if that's how she's trying to monetize social media.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but the way the author communicated his concerns might have been the issue. Instead of being supportive and discussing practical steps, he criticized her and her friends, which could have been demoralizing. Relationships require empathy, and his approach might have lacked that, leading to her feeling upset and defensive.\n\nAlso, the author is expecting her to take on half the rent, so ensuring she can afford it is reasonable. However, the method of communication and the tone in which he delivered his concerns might have been the problem. It's possible he's right about the financial concerns but wrong in how he expressed them. Alternatively, there might be valid reasons for her approach that he's not considering.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions might be good, but the way he handled the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer likely leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because the manner of his communication and specific comments were harsh and judgmental, even if his concerns are valid.\n"
