She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend is concerned about financial stability and real-world experience. He's worried that her plan isn't realistic and that she might end up struggling financially. He's also trying to set boundaries, not wanting to support her financially in the long run. His intentions seem to be about preparing her for adulthood and ensuring mutual responsibility if they move in together.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel criticized and devalued. She's about to finish her master's degree and may be looking for a different path. Her reliance on family support could be a point of contention, but she's also trying to explore her own methods of income through Instagram. The boyfriend's comments about her content might come off as condescending, which could hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is it reasonable for him to suggest she get a job? Yes, as financial independence is important. But the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" or suggesting her Instagram content is inappropriate could be hurtful and dismissive of her efforts. The tone and choice of words matter here. Even if his advice is valid, the delivery affected her emotionally, leading her to feel attacked. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's financial situation is better, but he's not willing to support her beyond half the rent, which is fair. However, his criticism about her friends and their lifestyles might be judgmental, implying that her social circle isn't contributing to her growth. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While his concerns are valid, the approach could be more supportive. Instead of making her feel like a failure, encouraging her to explore options while validating her efforts might have been more effective. The fact that she got emotionally upset suggests that his message was received negatively, not because the content was wrong, but how it was delivered.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend has valid points about financial responsibility, but the way he expressed them could be seen as condescending or hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the manner in which he communicated his concerns was damaging to their relationship, even if the underlying advice wasn't entirely incorrect.\n"
