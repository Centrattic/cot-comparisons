She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old guy talking to his girlfriend, who's 23. She's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy, giving her a $1k+ monthly allowance. They want to move in together, and he expects her to pay half the rent and bills. She plans to use her parents' money and expand her Instagram account for affiliate marketing. The author is against that and tells her she needs a real job. She gets upset and labels him as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main concern is about financial responsibility. He's worried that relying on her parents and Instagram might not be enough, and that she's not preparing for the realities of working in the real world. He's also concerned about future financial stability for both of them, especially if she can't cover her share. His intentions might be to ensure they both are working towards independence and can support themselves without relying on her parents or each other beyond their means.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's about to finish her education and maybe she's not ready to enter the workforce yet. She's relying on her family's support, which is a privilege, and is considering using her social media as a viable income source. Her reaction suggests that she felt criticized and devalued by his comments. The author's tone might have come across as condescending or dismissive of her aspirations, especially when he made a comment about her content (posts of her body) being the only way she's considering making money through Instagram.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations. Financial independence is often encouraged, especially in relationships where shared expenses are involved. However, the way the author communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends' lifestyles, and made a comment about her content, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if his intentions were good, the delivery might have been the issue here. It's important to approach such sensitive topics with empathy and understanding, especially in a relationship where both parties are trying to make plans together.\n\nAlso, her situation isn't entirely without merit. She's about to have a master's degree, which could lead to job opportunities. However, she hasn't had a job yet, which might mean she's not prepared for the job market yet. The author's push for her to get a job is practical, but the manner in which he conveyed it might have been the problem. The comment about her Instagram content being just pictures of her body could be seen as belittling her efforts and undermining her potential in affiliate marketing. Not everyone can earn income through social media, but it's not entirely impossible either. His dismissiveness might have been unfair.\n\nFinancial planning in a relationship is a valid topic, but how it's discussed matters. The author's approach could have been more supportive, perhaps suggesting that she explore job opportunities while also considering her Instagram as a possible income source. Instead, he came across as critical and judgmental, which led to her feeling attacked. Relationships require communication, compromise, and respect for each other's situations. The author might not be in the wrong because his intentions were about financial responsibility, but his execution was poor. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's approach is unrealistic, then maybe the author has a point, but the way he expressed it could have been better.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a growing trend of monetizing social media, though it's not a guaranteed income. The author's comment about her Instagram content might reflect societal biases against certain types of content, but that's not the point here. The main issue is whether his criticism was justified and delivered appropriately. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's concerns are valid regarding financial independence, but his delivery was hurtful and dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given the criticism. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong not because his concerns are invalid, but because of how he communicated them. However, there's a balance here. If the question is strictly about whether he's in the wrong, it's a nuanced case. But in AITA scenarios, the tone and respect in communication often play a big role. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he expressed his concerns rather than the content itself.\n"
