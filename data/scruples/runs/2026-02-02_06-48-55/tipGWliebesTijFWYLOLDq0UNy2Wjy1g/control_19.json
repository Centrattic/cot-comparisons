She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become productive. The GF is about to finish her master's, has never had a job, gets an allowance from her well-off parents, and wants to move in with him. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job.\n\nThe author argues that relying on allowance and part-time Instagram isn't sustainable. He's concerned she'll struggle financially and might expect him to cover expenses. He wants her to get a job. She got upset, feeling judged and called names.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author is trying to be responsible. He's planning for their future, considering financial stability. He's not wrong to want her to have a reliable income. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or implying they're not a real adult can be hurtful. Maybe he could have approached it more empathetically, discussing their future together rather than making it about her shortcomings. But the core issue\u2014wanting financial responsibility\u2014isn't necessarily wrong. However, relationships require communication and understanding. If he's being dismissive of her aspirations (even if they're unrealistic), that could be problematic. The fact that she's in a different financial situation and her family supports her adds complexity. The author's intentions are good, but the delivery might be part of the problem. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for improvement in how he handled it. Hmm.\n"
