She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to get her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her $1k+ a month allowance. She wants to move in with him, and she plans to use her allowance and expand her Instagram for income. The guy doesn't think that's enough and wants her to get a job, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, the guy's main argument is that relying on allowance and Instagram might not be a stable income. He wants her to get a job for financial stability. He's concerned about their financial future together. On the surface, that seems responsible. He's not okay with being the one to cover expenses if she can't contribute. But then he says some things that might come off as harsh, like implying she's a \"bum\" or that she's just posting for money, even though he acknowledges her content. That could be disrespectful.\n\nThe girl's perspective is that she's about to finish her education and her plan is to leverage her Instagram. She might feel that the guy is dismissive of her aspirations. The guy's friends might all be in the real world, which adds to the pressure. The girl feels criticized and called an asshole, which suggests the conversation was hurtful.\n\nNow, considering both sides: the guy's concern about financial responsibility is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. He didn't back up his arguments about Instagram earnings effectively, which could undermine his credibility. Also, making her feel like a \"bum\" is shaming, which isn't constructive. However, his intention to discuss financial planning is reasonable. \n\nThe key points here are communication style and the balance between being supportive and realistic. If he's pushing for her to take responsibility but does so in a demeaning way, that's problematic. On the other hand, if he's genuinely concerned about their future stability, there's a case for his position. It's a mix of both, but the way he expressed his concerns might have crossed a line. So, maybe the answer is A because he's in the wrong for how he communicated, even if the concerns are valid. But others might say B because his intentions are good. Hmm.\n"
