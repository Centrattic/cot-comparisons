She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her parents are wealthy and give her a $1k+ allowance. She wants to move in with him, and she plans to use her parents' money plus her Instagram for income. The author wants her to get a job instead, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about financial responsibility and moving into adulthood. He's worried that relying on allowance and possibly unreliable income from Instagram isn't sustainable. He's also concerned about the financial dynamics in their relationship, not wanting to end up covering expenses if she can't cover her half.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's in a relationship where her partner is critical of her lifestyle and ambitions. She might feel that her Instagram efforts are dismissed as not serious, and that her financial situation is being judged harshly. The argument led to her feeling belittled, which is a common relationship issue when one partner feels their choices are not respected.\n\nThe key points here are about financial independence, mutual respect, and communication. The author's intentions might be about preparing for a stable future together, but his approach might have come off as dismissive or judgmental. The question is whether his concerns are valid or if he's overstepping by pressuring her to change her career path. \n\nFinancial responsibility is important, but how he communicated his concerns matters. If he was condescending or invalidated her aspirations, that's a problem. However, if he's genuinely trying to discuss their future together and financial planning, that's reasonable. The fact that she's planning to use her parents' money and Instagram might not be as stable as a regular job, but that's her choice. It's about whether he had the right to impose his expectations on her without considering her perspective.\n\nAlso, the comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is a bit judgmental and could be seen as objectifying her, which might contribute to why she felt disrespected. The author could have expressed his concerns more constructively.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal goals with shared responsibilities. The author isn't wrong in wanting a stable financial situation, but the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt attacked, which indicates that the approach could have been more collaborative. So, while there are valid concerns on both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue respectfully and for making her feel like a failure.\n"
