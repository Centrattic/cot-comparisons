She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a 22-year-old guy, and his 23-year-old girlfriend. She's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her around $1,000 a month. They're planning to move in together, and she wants her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing to cover half the rent and bills. The author is upset and insists she needs a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The author's perspective is that financial responsibility is important. He's concerned about her relying on family money and an uncertain income source (Instagram affiliate marketing). He's right to be cautious about the financial stability of their future living arrangement. His job is going well, on track for $70k, but he doesn't want to subsidize her lifestyle. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute fairly, especially when moving in together.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be the issue. The way he expressed his concerns\u2014calling her a \"bum,\" making comments about her content, and using her friends as a comparison\u2014could come off as dismissive and disrespectful. Telling her she's not an adult and that she's avoiding reality might be harsh, especially if she's transitioning from an academic environment to the workforce. While his intentions are about financial responsibility, the tone and choice of words might have hurt her feelings unnecessarily.\n\nOn her side, she's planning to move into a new phase after her master's, which might involve entering the job market. Her current support system (family) is providing her with some financial cushion, but she's trying to transition (affiliate marketing). She might feel that her efforts are being undermined, and the criticism from her partner is harsh. Her reaction shows she felt hurt and devalued, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's criticism is justified in how he delivered it. While his concerns about financial stability are valid, the method of communication and the harshness of his words could be considered inconsiderate. Relationships require empathy and understanding, especially when discussing sensitive topics like finances and personal goals. The author might be right in his stance but wrong in his approach. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's plan to use her Instagram for income might not be as stable as a traditional job, but it's her choice to explore. The author's dismissal of her efforts and personal attacks on her content could be seen as condescending. It's possible that a more supportive approach, like discussing strategies to build her affiliate marketing alongside seeking a job, could have been better received.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have valid concerns about financial responsibility, but his handling of the situation\u2014using harsh language and disrespectful comments\u2014could place him in the wrong. The answer here is likely A, as he's right in the concern but wrong in the execution.\n"
