She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on family money, and plans to move in with him where she'll use her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing for expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. He's concerned about financial responsibility and wants her to have a stable income. His arguments are based on practicality: suggesting a job would provide more reliable income than relying on family and uncertain affiliate marketing. He's also concerned about their shared financial future if she can't manage her own expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she's finishing a master's degree and has a support system. She's planning to monetize her Instagram, which might be a valid path for some, though it's not traditional. The author's tone might have come off as dismissive or harsh, especially with the comment about her content. That could have hurt her feelings, even if his intentions were to push her towards responsibility.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but how it's communicated matters. The author's approach might have been too direct or lacking empathy, leading to the upset reaction. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or condescending. If he focused more on their future together and the practicalities without belittling her aspirations, it might have been received better.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's background plays a role. Her family's financial support allows her to pursue education without working, which is a privilege. However, she's now entering a shared living situation where self-sufficiency is necessary. The author is right to point this out, but the method of delivery could be questioned.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The author's comment about her content being \"pics of her ass and tits\" might be a sensitive topic, especially if her Instagram is a legitimate business venture. Dismissing her efforts as just that could undermine her confidence and the validity of her chosen path.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author has a valid concern but expressed it in a way that may have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she felt criticized for her lifestyle and aspirations. The balance between encouraging responsibility and respecting her choices is key here. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the way he communicated, even if the underlying issue is about financial planning.\n"
