She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's and has never worked a job. Her parents give her around $1k a month as an allowance, and she wants to move in with him. He's okay with her paying half the rent and bills, but when he asks how she'll cover her share, she says her allowance and expanding her Instagram to make money via affiliate marketing. He's against that, telling her she needs a real job, that relying on her parents isn't sustainable, and that she shouldn't expect him to pay for things. He also makes a comment about her making money off posts of her body, which she finds offensive. She gets upset and calls him names.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being realistic. He's concerned about their financial future if she doesn't have a stable income. He's worried that relying on her parents and an unpredictable income source (Instagram) isn't responsible. He's also trying to set boundaries, not wanting to support her financially beyond what she's paying for rent. His comments, while harsh, stem from a place of wanting her to be independent and prepared.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she's transitioning from academic life to the real world. She might feel that her plans are valid\u2014using her social media presence for affiliate marketing is a legitimate way to make money, though it's risky. She might also feel that her boyfriend is being dismissive and condescending, especially with the comment about her body, which could be seen as belittling. The fact that she's upset and feels called a \"bum\" suggests he might have crossed a line in how he communicated his concerns.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but how it's discussed matters. The author's approach was blunt and possibly disrespectful, especially the part about her Instagram content. Even if he's right about the financial practicality, the way he delivered his message could have been more supportive. Maybe he should have collaborated on a plan instead of criticizing her current path. Also, considering her family's financial support, maybe there's room for negotiation, but he's right to want her to be self-sufficient.\n\nThe key issue here is communication style. The author's message, while well-intentioned, was delivered in a harsh and potentially insulting manner. That's where the conflict arises. If he had expressed his concerns without attacking her choices or making derogatory remarks about her content, she might have been more receptive. His comment about her body was especially problematic and could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the truth in his concerns.\n\nSo, even if he's right about the financial aspects, the way he communicated them is where he's in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
