She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is 22, the girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's, never had a job, and gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents. They're planning to move in together, and he's concerned she won't contribute enough financially. He wants her to get a job, while she's counting on her parents' money and affiliate marketing via Instagram. The guy says she's not realistic, and she felt criticized and upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. On one hand, he's being practical. He's worried about their financial future and wants her to be independent. It's reasonable to expect a partner to contribute to shared expenses. On the other hand, he's being judgmental about her current setup and her plans. He called her an adult who hasn't entered the \"real world,\" which might come off as dismissive of her aspirations, even if they're naive. The comments about her using Instagram for affiliate marketing by posting certain content could be seen as disrespectful or undermining her goals.\n\nAlso, communication style matters. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or calling others \"assholes\" isn't constructive. While his intentions might be to protect their future, the way he delivered the criticism hurt her feelings and made her feel attacked. Relationships require mutual respect and support. Even if his concerns are valid, the approach might be flawed. He could have discussed this more compassionately, exploring her ideas for affiliate marketing instead of dismissing them outright.\n\nAnother angle: She's transitioning from academia to the workforce. Maybe she's not ready to take on a traditional job. His insistence without understanding her perspective could create tension. However, financial responsibility is important in a partnership. There's a balance between supporting each other's goals and ensuring practicality.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's criticism was necessary but delivered poorly. He might not be in the wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but the way he communicated it could have been better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, meaning yes, then the user's initial thought aligns. If B, no, then the author isn't entirely wrong but could improve communication. Given the situation, maybe the answer is A because the approach was harsh and disrespectful, even if the concern is valid.\n"
