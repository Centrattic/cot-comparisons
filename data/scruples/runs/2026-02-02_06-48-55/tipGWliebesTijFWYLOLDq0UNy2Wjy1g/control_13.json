She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the man telling his girlfriend she should get a job and be more productive instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility. His girlfriend isn't working, has a substantial allowance, and plans to rely on that and her Instagram for income. He's worried they'll struggle financially if they move in together, and that she's not taking adult responsibilities seriously. He's also honest about his own financial situation, expecting to make $70k, but doesn't want to support her if she doesn't contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's, which is an achievement. She might see her Instagram as a legitimate way to earn money, even if it's not traditional. The guy's comments about her posts being \"pics of her ass and tits\" might come off as condescending or dismissive of her efforts. Even if he's right about the financial instability, the way he communicated it could be hurtful. He might be projecting his own values onto her without considering her perspective or the pressure she's under.\n\nThe key points here are communication style, respect for her choices, and the practicality of her financial plan. While financial planning is important, the way the man expressed his concerns might have been harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" or an \"asshole\" isn't helpful. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable if she felt criticized for her lifestyle choices, especially if her family supports her. The question is whether his advice was valid but delivered poorly, making him at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable and respectful. Even if the guy's concerns are valid, the way he expressed them could be seen as disrespectful, leading to hurt feelings. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh communication and judgmental attitude, even if his financial concerns are legitimate.\n"
