She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society. She's about to graduate with a master's, hasn't worked before, lives with her well-off parents, gets an allowance, and wants to move in with him. He's okay with her paying half the rent, but when she says she'll rely on her allowance and Instagram, he tells her she should get a job instead. She gets upset and calls him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, first, I need to evaluate both sides. The guy's reasoning is that she needs to be financially independent, not rely on her parents and a potentially unstable income from Instagram. He's concerned about her financial future and their shared future if they live together. He's also worried she might expect him to cover expenses even if she doesn't contribute enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she's in a relationship where she's expected to make the leap into working, but she has other plans. She might feel that her partner is dismissing her goals (like expanding Instagram) as frivolous, especially since her content is something she's chosen to do. The way he phrased things, like \"posting pics of her ass and tits,\" could be hurtful and undermine her efforts. \n\nFinancial independence is important, and wanting a partner to be responsible is valid. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or implying their chosen method of income is frivolous can be damaging to their self-esteem. Also, suggesting that her friends' lack of real-world experience is a problem for her might make her feel judged. \n\nIt's possible that the guy's intentions are good, but his approach was not considerate of her feelings or her perspective. He might not have considered that she has aspirations or that her Instagram could be a legitimate source of income, even if it's not traditional. Also, the part where he says she's posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is condescending and could be seen as objectifying her, which is definitely a negative point. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if he's right about the financial planning, the way he delivered it was probably not constructive. He might have been more effective if he discussed the financial aspects without making personal attacks. So, while the concern is valid, the manner in which he handled it is questionable. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because his approach was hurtful and dismissive, even if his intentions were to encourage responsibility. The way he communicated his concerns caused her emotional distress, which is a problem in any relationship.\n"
