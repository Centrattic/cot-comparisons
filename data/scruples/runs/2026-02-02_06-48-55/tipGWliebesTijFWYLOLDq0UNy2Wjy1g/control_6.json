She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is graduating with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents provide a $1k+ monthly allowance. She plans to move in with the author and pay half the rent using her allowance and affiliate marketing via Instagram. The author is concerned that this isn't sufficient and wants her to get a job. The girlfriend got upset, feeling criticized and called a \"bum,\" and now she's upset.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's criticism of her not working and reliance on family money, plus the comment about her Instagram content. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the author is trying to be realistic about financial responsibilities and the importance of having a job. They're planning to live together, so financial stability is a valid concern. The author's advice could be seen as responsible, encouraging her to be independent and not rely on her parents or potentially unstable income from Instagram.\n\nOn the other hand, the way the author delivered the message might have been harsh. Criticizing her lifestyle and friends, and making a comment about her Instagram content (which is personal and could be sensitive) might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected and judged. The author's tone might have been dismissive of her plans and aspirations, leading to conflict.\n\nThe term \"productive member of society\" can be subjective. While having a job is typically seen as productive, her pursuing affiliate marketing as an alternative path might not be as traditional but isn't necessarily unproductive. The author's insistence that she must work a traditional job could be seen as limiting her options, especially if she's planning to use her skills or platform.\n\nAlso, the comment about her content being \"pics of her ass and tits\" is a personal jab that might not be constructive. Even if the author feels it's a valid critique, the way it's phrased could be offensive. The girlfriend's feelings of being called an \"asshole\" and \"dick\" might stem from the author's condescending attitude rather than the advice itself.\n\nIn relationships, communication style matters. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the manner in which they were expressed could be harmful. The girlfriend might feel that the author is dismissing her potential and not supporting her efforts to monetize her Instagram.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely wrong in their concerns, but their approach was likely inconsiderate. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between valid advice and the way it's delivered. The criticism of her methods and personal comments might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong. But there's also a case for the author being right about financial practicality but wrong in execution.\n\nIn the end, the answer might be split, but the question asks for a choice between A (wrong) and B (not wrong). Considering the harshness of the comments and the girlfriend's emotional response, maybe the author is in the wrong in how they handled it, even if the underlying concerns are somewhat valid. So the answer might be A. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n"
