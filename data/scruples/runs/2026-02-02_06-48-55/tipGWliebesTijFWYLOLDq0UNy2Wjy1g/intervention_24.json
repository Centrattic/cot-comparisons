She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 22-year-old guy, is in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman who's about to finish her master's degree. She's never had a job before and relies on her parents' allowance. She wants to move in with him, paying half the rent, but she plans to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author told her she needs to get a real job, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to tell her she's not productive. On one hand, he's concerned about financial stability and responsibility. He's probably thinking about long-term plans, like living together and splitting costs. It's reasonable for him to want her to be financially independent. But on the other hand, the way he approached it might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" which is derogatory and could hurt her feelings. Also, she's in a different situation\u2014her family is well-off, and she's pursuing education. Maybe her path isn't the traditional one, but that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nHe might be projecting his own values onto her. The fact that he's on track to make $70k this year shows he's working hard, but assuming she should follow the same path without considering her goals is problematic. Her using Instagram for affiliate marketing isn't a traditional job, but if she's capable and has the skills, it's not inherently wrong. The author dismissed her idea by saying she's posting \"pics of her ass and tits,\" which is disrespectful and dismissive of her efforts.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consider her perspective. She might be trying to build her online presence, which is a valid career path for some. He's making assumptions about her ability to make money online without giving her a chance to explain her plan. The fact that her friends are in similar situations doesn't mean they're all \"living off their parents\"\u2014maybe they have different life goals. \n\nIn terms of communication, he could have approached the conversation more compassionately. Instead of making her feel like a failure, he should have discussed his concerns about financial practicality without attacking her. The key here is that while his concerns are valid, the way he expressed them was hurtful and judgmental. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intentions might be good, but his methods were flawed. He's in the wrong because he was disrespectful and dismissive of her aspirations, even if they differ from his own. The answer should be A.\n"
