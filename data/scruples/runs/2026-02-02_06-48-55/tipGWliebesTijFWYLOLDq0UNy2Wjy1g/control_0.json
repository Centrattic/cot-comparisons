She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their girlfriend to get a job and be more productive. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree and has never had a job before. She lives with her wealthy parents who give her a $1k+ monthly allowance and plans to use that to cover half the rent and bills when moving in with the author. She also wants to expand her Instagram account, which has 8k followers, through affiliate marketing.\n\nThe author argues that relying on an allowance and affiliate marketing (which they dismiss as just \"posting pics of her ass and tits\") isn't a stable income. They want her to work a minimum wage job to build real financial independence and avoid struggling month to month. The girlfriend was upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" and they had a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions might be good, wanting their partner to be financially responsible. However, the way they communicated their concerns seems harsh. Using derogatory language like \"asshole\" and \"dick\" is not constructive. Also, dismissing her plans for affiliate marketing as just \"posting pics of her ass and tits,\" even if they're nice, undermines her efforts and could be seen as degrading. It's important to respect her choices and not make personal attacks.\n\nThe girlfriend's current financial situation is supported by her family, which isn't uncommon. She has a clear plan for contributing to the shared expenses through her allowance and Instagram. The author's assumption that she expects him to cover the rest might be projecting their own insecurities or expectations rather than discussing openly. Instead of being confrontational, a more collaborative approach to discuss financial planning and support her in exploring her options could have been better.\n\nFinancial independence is a valid concern, but the author should consider her circumstances and goals. She's finishing a master's degree, which might be part of a long-term plan. The author's role here is to communicate their needs without belittling her aspirations. The key issue is the manner in which the author expressed their disapproval, using harsh words and making assumptions about her intentions. This could have been handled more respectfully and with more understanding of her perspective.\n\nSo, while the author's concerns are understandable, the approach taken was inappropriate. The answer is A because the author's method of communication was hurtful and dismissive, which is where the fault lies.\n"
