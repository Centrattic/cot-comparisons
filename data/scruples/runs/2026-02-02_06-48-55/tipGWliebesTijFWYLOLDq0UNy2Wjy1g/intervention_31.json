She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy, tells his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The girlfriend is moving in with him and wants to split the rent, but he thinks she's not being realistic.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that she should work a real job, save money, and not depend on her family or social media. He's concerned about financial stability and maybe future responsibilities. On the other hand, the girlfriend is about to finish her master's and hasn't worked before. Her plan is to use her Instagram and her parents' allowance to cover the costs. She got upset, thinking he's being harsh.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility versus support and understanding. The author's intentions might be good\u2014he wants her to be independent. But the way he communicated it could be the issue. He called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends, and made her feel attacked. That's probably why she felt hurt. Even if his points are valid, the tone and approach might have been too harsh, making him come off as dismissive of her efforts and dreams.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship dynamics, he's not in a position to dictate her career choices. While financial planning is important, respecting her aspirations and providing encouragement instead of criticism might have been better. The fact that she's moving in with him and he's already earning a good salary (70k) might mean they can support each other financially, but he's setting strict terms without much flexibility.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, emotional harm is a big factor. The girlfriend felt belittled, which is a red flag. Even if his intentions are good, causing emotional distress could make him the asshole. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if the content of his message has some merit.\n"
