She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a guy in a relationship with a girl who's about to finish her master's, is telling her she needs to get a job and not rely on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The girl is upset because he called her a bum and criticized her lifestyle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's trying to be realistic. He's worried about financial stability when they move in together. He thinks she should work a real job instead of just relying on her parents and social media, which he seems to look down on, especially since she's posting things he considers inappropriate (though he admits they're nice). He's trying to set boundaries, maybe to avoid financial strain and ensure they both contribute equally.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she's coming from a supportive family, has a stable allowance, and is trying to monetize her Instagram. She might feel that the author is being harsh and dismissive of her efforts. Moving in together is a big step, and he's making demands that could be seen as judgmental or undermining her capabilities. She might feel that his criticism is about her lifestyle and the way she makes money, which could be personal for her.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. Is it wrong for the author to express his concerns about their financial future? It's reasonable to discuss how they'll manage expenses when cohabiting. But the way he delivered his message might be an issue. He called her a \"bum\" and criticized her friends and their lifestyle, which could be harsh and condescending. Even if his intentions are good, the tone matters. Relationships require mutual respect, and if he's belittling her, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the author is implying that her Instagram work isn't real or sufficient, but affiliate marketing can be a legitimate source of income. Dismissing it outright without considering her potential might be unfair. He might not have given her enough credit for her own plans and skills.\n\nAnother angle: the girl is transitioning from a financially supported environment to living independently. The author's push for her to work a traditional job might be a reaction to his own values, expecting her to conform to his idea of productivity. However, it's possible she has different priorities or a different approach to work and life. The conflict here is about differing life perspectives, and the author's way of handling it might not be supportive enough.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should discuss their expectations and support each other. The author could have framed his concerns more constructively, perhaps suggesting exploring job opportunities together or discussing the viability of her Instagram income, rather than criticizing her current situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intentions might be to ensure financial stability, but his approach was harsh and disrespectful, which is why the girl felt hurt. While it's okay to have concerns about financial planning, the way he expressed them crossed a line. Therefore, he's in the wrong because of how he communicated his message, not necessarily the message itself.\n"
