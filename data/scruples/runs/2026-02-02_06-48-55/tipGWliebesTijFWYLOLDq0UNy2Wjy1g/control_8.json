She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to get her master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k monthly allowance. She wants to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing. He argues she should get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy is concerned about financial stability and realism. He's worried that relying on her parents' money and Instagram (which might not be reliable) isn't sustainable. He's right to think about practicality, especially since they're moving in together. Financial independence is usually advised in relationships to avoid dependency.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has just finished her studies and may not have job experience. She might feel that her Instagram work is a valid path, and the guy's criticism about her using her assets (in her case, social media presence) might come off as dismissive. His comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" is harsh and judgmental, even if his intent was to critique her strategy. That part is definitely insensitive.\n\nHe's also pointing out the reality of min-wage jobs versus her current lifestyle. But the way he communicated his concerns might have been too harsh, making her feel attacked. The key here is how he framed his advice. Instead of supporting her to explore other options, he criticized her current approach, leading to conflict.\n\nFinancial discussions in relationships are tough. The guy has a valid point about responsibility, but his delivery was abrasive. The girl's reaction is understandable if she feels her aspirations are being dismissed. The question is whether his intentions were right but the method wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the guy's concerns are reasonable, his approach in communicating them was hurtful and disrespectful. That makes him at least partially at fault. But the girl also needs to take responsibility for her financial planning. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he used harsh language and came off as dismissive, the answer leans towards A.\n"
