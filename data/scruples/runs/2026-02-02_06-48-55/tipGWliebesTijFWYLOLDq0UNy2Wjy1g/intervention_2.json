She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the guy is telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money off Instagram.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is finishing her master's and has never had a job. The guy is okay with her moving in but wants her to be financially independent. He's worried she'll struggle if she relies on her parents and affiliate marketing. She got upset and feels judged. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should analyze both sides. On one hand, the guy is concerned about their future financial stability and wants her to be responsible. That's reasonable. But the way he expressed it might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" implied she's not an adult, and criticized her approach to making money. That could come off as condescending, especially if she's not used to such criticism. \n\nAlso, her financial situation is that she's supported by her family. It's not uncommon for some people to rely on family support while in education. Maybe the guy didn't consider that her transition into the workforce might need time, or that her Instagram venture could have potential. However, relying solely on that might be risky. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key points are intent and delivery. If his intent was to help and he communicated it respectfully, maybe not. But he came off as dismissive, using terms like \"just go to school for no reason\" and mocking her content. That's probably where he went wrong. Even if his concerns are valid, the tone and harshness could have been a major issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while his concerns might be valid, the way he communicated them was disrespectful and hurtful.\n"
