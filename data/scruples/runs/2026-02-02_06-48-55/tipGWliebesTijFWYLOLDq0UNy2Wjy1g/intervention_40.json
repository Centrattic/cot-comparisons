She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the guy where she'll use her Instagram for income. The guy is pushing her to get a job instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. The guy's main concern is financial responsibility. He wants her to be independent and not rely solely on her parents or potentially unstable income from social media. His argument is practical: a minimum wage job could provide more stable income, saving, and independence. He's also concerned about the financial strain if she can't cover her share, leading to him having to subsidize her, which he's not willing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is important too. She's about to finish her master's degree and might be in a transitional period. Her plan to use Instagram, while maybe not traditional, could be a valid path for her. The guy's tone and approach might have come across as dismissive or condescending, especially calling her posts \"pics of her ass and tits\" and criticizing her friends' lifestyles. That could have hurt her feelings and made her feel judged, which might not be the best way to approach a sensitive topic in a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual respect. Even if the guy's intentions are good (wanting her to be financially responsible), the way he communicated it could have been harsh. Relationships require support and understanding, not just blunt criticism. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her choices or her potential in the social media space. While financial responsibility is valid, the method of addressing it affects the relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, considering her background\u2014coming from a wealthy family and not working before\u2014his criticism might not account for her different life experiences. He's trying to push her into the \"real world,\" but he should also consider her individual circumstances and how she perceives her own capabilities. The fact that she got upset and felt judged indicates that the conversation wasn't handled well, even if the topic is important.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The guy isn't wrong for wanting her to be responsible, but he might have overstepped by not being supportive and instead being critical of her aspirations. The girlfriend's feelings being hurt and the conflict arising show that the approach was problematic. So, while his intentions could be seen as trying to help, the execution was flawed. Therefore, he could be partially at fault for not handling the situation with more empathy and respect for her perspective.\n"
