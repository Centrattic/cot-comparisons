She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become productive. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's, hasn't worked before, and relies on her parents' allowance. She plans to use her Instagram (8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The author is concerned about her financial stability and future, so he expresses his worries, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about responsibility, financial independence, and preparing for real-world challenges. His girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel criticized for her choices and possibly pressured into a situation she's not ready for. The author is concerned she might rely on him financially, which he's not willing to do. \n\nIs it wrong to encourage someone to be responsible? Probably not. But the way he communicated it might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum\" and made derogatory comments about her Instagram content, which could be hurtful. Even if the intention was to push her towards responsibility, the tone and language might have been too harsh, leading to her feeling attacked. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's situation is that she's transitioning from a supportive family environment to independence. Maybe she has her own reasons for choosing affiliate marketing, which the author dismissed. The author's friends' situations also play a role in her perspective. The key here is whether the criticism was constructive or just hurtful. \n\nThe author is right to want to avoid financial strain in their future together, but the method of communication could be the issue. Advising someone to get a job isn't wrong, but doing so in a demeaning way might be. The answer would depend on whether the criticism was justified in its content and delivery.\n"
