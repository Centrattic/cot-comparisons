She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the girlfriend is graduating with a master's but has never had a job. She plans to use her parents' allowance and expand her Instagram for income when they move in together. The author argues she should get a job instead of relying on her family and social media, which he thinks is unrealistic.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's family is well-off, providing her with $1k monthly. She's moving in with the author, and he expects her to contribute half the rent. The author feels she's not being responsible by not getting a job, relying on her parents and affiliate marketing. He's concerned about financial stability and not wanting to subsidize her lifestyle.\n\nThe girlfriend got upset and felt criticized. The author's tone seems harsh, especially the comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits.\" That's probably not helpful. But is he wrong for expressing his concerns about financial responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to want his partner to be financially independent, especially if they're moving in together. It's reasonable to expect both partners to contribute to shared expenses. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been hurtful. The part about her Instagram content being degrading could be seen as belittling. Also, assuming she expects him to cover the costs might be an unfair assumption.\n\nThe key points are whether his criticism was constructive or just harsh. While his intentions might be valid\u2014financial prudence\u2014he approached it in a way that made her feel attacked. The question is whether his message is right but delivered poorly. In relationships, how you communicate is as important as the message itself. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for the tone and specific comments, even if the underlying concern is valid. But some might argue that he's right to push for financial responsibility.\n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Considering that he's not entirely wrong in wanting her to work, but the way he expressed it was hurtful and dismissive. The comment about her Instagram content is particularly problematic. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the harsh delivery and undermining her efforts. Even if the concerns are valid, the approach matters.\n"
