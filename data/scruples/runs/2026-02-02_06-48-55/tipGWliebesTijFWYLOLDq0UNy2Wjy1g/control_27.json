She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting that his girlfriend, who's about to finish her master's and hasn't worked, should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram for income. The girlfriend is upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" while the author is concerned about financial responsibility and their future together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about financial stability. He's earning $70k and wants his partner to be independent, contributing equally. That's a valid concern for a shared living situation. However, the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Phrases like \"don't just go to school for no reason\" and commenting on her Instagram content (posting \"pics of her ass and tits\") could come off as dismissive or condescending. He also mentions her friends aren't in the real world, which might imply judgment on her social circle.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is transitioning from a supportive family environment where she's been financially provided for. Moving out and managing finances is a big step for her. She's planning to use her Instagram for income, which might not be feasible, but she's trying to adapt. The author's approach might not have acknowledged her efforts or provided support in exploring realistic options. Instead, he criticized her current path without offering alternatives or understanding her challenges.\n\nFinancial planning in a relationship is important, but communication style matters. The author's tone could have been more collaborative. Instead of making her feel like a failure, he could have discussed practical steps together, like looking for jobs or evaluating her Instagram's potential. The key issue here is whether the criticism was constructive or just harsh. Since the girlfriend felt belittled, the author's approach might have been too confrontational without considering her emotional state and the sudden change in her life circumstances.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are reasonable (financial responsibility), the method of delivery and the judgmental remarks likely contributed to the conflict. It's possible he's not entirely wrong in his concerns, but the way he expressed them was hurtful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the criticism was delivered in a way that made his partner feel devalued, even if the concerns are valid.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A  \nThe author's approach, while rooted in valid concerns about financial responsibility, was delivered in a harsh and judgmental manner. Dismissing her efforts (e.g., calling her Instagram posts \"pics of her ass and tits\") and framing her reliance on family support as a failure (\"don't just go to school for no reason\") likely made her feel devalued. While encouraging independence is reasonable, the tone and lack of empathy contributed to the conflict. The author\u2019s failure to collaborate on solutions (e.g., exploring job opportunities together) and instead assigning blame likely exacerbated the situation.",
