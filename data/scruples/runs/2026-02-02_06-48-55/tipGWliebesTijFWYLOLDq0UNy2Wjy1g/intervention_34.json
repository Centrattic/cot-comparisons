She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend that she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about financial responsibility and stability. He's worried that if she relies on her allowance and Instagram, she might not have enough money after paying rent and bills. He's also against her making money from content that he perceives as just photos of her body. He's trying to encourage her to be more productive and live independently.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a financially stable family and might not have had the same pressures as the author. Her parents are providing her with an allowance, which is a common practice in some families. She's also pursuing a master's degree, which might be a path towards her career. Her plan to use Instagram for affiliate marketing could be seen as a legitimate attempt to generate income, even if it's not traditional. The author's comments about her content and friends not being in the real world might come off as dismissive or judgmental, which could hurt her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. While the author has valid concerns about financial stability, the way he expressed them might have been harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" and questioning her ability to make money through her content, especially with a demeaning comment about the type of content, isn't constructive. It's important to approach such discussions without putting down the other person's efforts. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the conversation was hurtful, which might indicate that the author could have handled the situation more sensitively.\n\nFinancial independence is important, but the method of discussing it matters. The author's tone and choice of words seem to lack empathy. Instead of being confrontational, he might have benefited from a more collaborative approach, discussing both their financial goals and supporting each other's career paths. The girlfriend's reliance on her parents' allowance might not be sustainable, but the author's approach could have been more supportive rather than critical.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to balance honesty with kindness. The author's intentions might be good, but the delivery was harsh. He's not entirely wrong in wanting her to be financially responsible, but his way of expressing it could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's feelings being hurt is a red flag that the communication wasn't effective. So, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, even if his concerns are valid.\n"
