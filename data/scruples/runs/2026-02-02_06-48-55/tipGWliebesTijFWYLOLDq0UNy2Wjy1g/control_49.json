She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves his girlfriend, who has a master's degree but no work experience, planning to move in with him. He's concerned about her relying on her parents' allowance and her plan to monetize her Instagram through affiliate marketing, which he thinks isn't reliable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expressing his concerns about their financial future and his belief that his girlfriend should work to be independent. He's trying to be realistic, pointing out the financial struggles they might face if she doesn't have a steady income. On the other hand, his girlfriend is upset because she feels judged and criticized, which makes the author wonder if he's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the key points. The author is voicing his concerns about their living arrangements and financial stability. He's not forcing her to do anything but is expressing his expectations. However, the way he communicates his concerns might come off as harsh or dismissive. He mentions her Instagram content in a derogatory way, which could be seen as disrespectful. That part might be problematic because it undermines her potential efforts and could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's background is that she's from a well-off family and hasn't needed to work. Transitioning to a new life with a partner might be challenging, and the author's approach might not be supportive enough. While his intentions are about financial responsibility, the method of communication is crucial. Telling someone they're a \"bum\" or implying they're not contributing could damage their self-esteem and the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to set realistic expectations. He's not wrong in thinking that relying solely on an allowance and affiliate marketing might not be sustainable. But the way he frames it, especially the part about her Instagram posts, might be the main issue. It's possible that the author is right about the financial concerns but wrong in how he expresses them.\n\nAnother angle is that the author should be considerate of her situation and perhaps offer support in finding a job or exploring different income streams instead of just criticizing her current approach. Communication is key in relationships, and while it's important to address financial issues, doing so in a respectful and collaborative manner is better.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's concerns are valid, but the manner in which he communicated them, especially the derogatory comment about her Instagram content, is likely the main issue. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong not for the content of his message (expecting her to be financially responsible) but for the way he delivered it, which was disrespectful and hurtful.\n"
