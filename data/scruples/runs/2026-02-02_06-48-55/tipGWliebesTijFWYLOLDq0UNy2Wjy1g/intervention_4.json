She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a guy, telling his girlfriend she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's and has never worked. The author is concerned about financial stability when they move in together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is that relying solely on an allowance and uncertain Instagram income isn't responsible, especially if they're cohabiting and splitting costs. He's concerned she might struggle financially and expects him to cover for her, even though he's earning well. He's encouraging her to be more \"realistic\" by getting a job. His intention seems to be about financial security and adult responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was being upset, feeling like he's calling her a bum. She's in a program that's supposed to lead to a master's, which may have a non-traditional path. Her parents are supporting her, so maybe she's been in a more sheltered environment. The author's tone might have come off as harsh or dismissive, even if his concerns are valid. He called her out for her friends' influence and not seeing the real world, which could be hurtful. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, having a valid concern doesn't mean the approach was right. Telling someone they're not responsible without considering their circumstances or being supportive can be damaging. The author might have been right to express his financial concerns, but the way he did it\u2014maybe being critical and implying she's lazy\u2014might have been the issue. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, which suggests the communication was poor. \n\nAlso, expecting someone to transition from a supported life to working a job might be a big step, and he might not have considered the emotional impact. Maybe he should have been more understanding and offered support instead of criticism. The key here is whether his intentions were about their future or making her feel bad. If he's focused on their shared financial health but handled it poorly, he's not entirely wrong but could be in the wrong for the way he delivered his message. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent versus impact. If the impact was hurtful, even if the concern was valid, the person might be at fault. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while his concerns are understandable, the way he addressed them was harsh and made her feel belittled, which is a common AITA issue where the delivery is as important as the message.\n"
