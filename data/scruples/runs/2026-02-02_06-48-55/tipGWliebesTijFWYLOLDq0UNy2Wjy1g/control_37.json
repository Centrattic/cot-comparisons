She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is about to finish her master's, has never worked, gets a $1k+ allowance from her parents, wants to move in with him, and plans to cover half the rent with her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. The author is pushing her to get a job, arguing she should be more responsible, and that she might struggle financially otherwise. She got upset, feeling called out and insulted.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is concerned about their financial future together and is being honest about his expectations. He's not forcing her to do anything, but he's setting boundaries. He's also pointing out practical issues, like how relying on Instagram might not be reliable. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh, especially mentioning her posts being about her body. That could come off as disrespectful, even if the intent was to highlight impracticality.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is transitioning into a new phase of her life. He's trying to help her become financially independent, which is a valid concern. But the method of communication is key here. The question isn't just about whether he's right in his advice, but if he was in the wrong in how he presented it. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the language used might have been condescending or judgmental.\n\nAlso, considering mutual respect in relationships. Even if his advice is well-meaning, the way he delivered it could be seen as dismissive of her plans and dreams. The Instagram idea might not be feasible, but he didn't support her in exploring alternative ways; instead, he criticized her current approach. \n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The girlfriend is an adult, so the author shouldn't necessarily dictate her career choices. However, since they're planning to cohabit, financial stability is a shared concern. The author's stance is that she should be responsible, which is reasonable, but the tone and content of the criticism might have been harsh.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about balance. The author's intentions are to encourage responsibility, but the execution might have been flawed. The girlfriend's feelings of being belittled are important. If the author was condescending or made her feel like a failure, that's a problem. However, if he was just being honest and realistic, maybe not. The mention of her friends and her family's wealth adds context about her environment, which the author took into account.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the advice was given respectfully. Since the girlfriend was upset and felt judged, the author might be at fault for not communicating more compassionately. But the core issue of financial responsibility isn't wrong. It's a mix of valid concerns and poor communication. However, in the context of AITA, it's more about the moral responsibility and the way the message was delivered. So the author might be in the wrong for the delivery, not necessarily the advice itself.\n"
