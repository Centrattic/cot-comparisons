She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy (M22) who's in a relationship with a girl (F23) who's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance, and she wants to move in with him. She plans to use her Instagram (with 8k followers) for affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. The guy tells her she needs to get a job, and they argue, leading to her feeling hurt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy is concerned about financial responsibility and realism. He's planning to make $70k this year and wants her to be independent. He's worried she'll rely on him or struggle financially if she doesn't work. His reasoning is about preparing her for adult life and financial independence, which is valid. However, his approach might have been harsh. Criticizing her for not working, suggesting she's living off her parents, and making derogatory remarks about her plans (like posting \"pics of her ass and tits\") could be seen as disrespectful and dismissive of her efforts and aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has a master's degree and might have her own career plans. She might be trying to build her online presence, which is a legitimate path for some. However, relying solely on affiliate marketing with 8k followers might not be realistic without a proven track record. The guy's concern about financial stability is legitimate, but the way he communicated it could have been more supportive. He could have discussed the risks and alternatives, like part-time work while building her Instagram, instead of making her feel like a \"bum.\"\n\nThe key points are communication style and respect. Even if his intentions are good, the way he expressed his concerns hurt her feelings. It's important in relationships to support each other's goals while having realistic discussions. The author's comments might come off as condescending, especially pointing out her friends' lifestyles and implying she's not serious about working. This could be seen as undermining her and her choices, even if he's right about the practical aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about financial responsibility, his approach was likely too harsh and disrespectful. Being in the wrong here isn't about whether the advice was good, but how it was delivered and the impact on the relationship. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the dismissive and hurtful communication style."
