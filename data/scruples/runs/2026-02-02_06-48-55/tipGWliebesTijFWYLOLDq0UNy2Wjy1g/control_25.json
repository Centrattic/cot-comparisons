She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend is telling his girlfriend, who's about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job, that she needs to get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing. She got upset, feeling like he was calling her a bum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is concerned about their financial future. He's renting an apartment by himself and wants her to contribute equally. He's not okay with her relying on family money and wants her to be independent. He's suggesting a practical path, like getting a job, which would give her financial stability. On the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a family that's financially stable, and she's planning to move in with him but expects to cover her half of the rent with her allowance and Instagram. She's upset because he criticized her approach and made her feel bad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about financial responsibility, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend is pushing for financial responsibility, which is understandable. However, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He called her out for not being a \"productive member of society,\" criticized her income sources (like making fun of her using Instagram to post certain content), and grouped her with friends who also rely on family money. This approach could come off as dismissive and disrespectful, making her feel attacked instead of supporting a constructive discussion.\n\nFinancial independence is important, especially in a partnership. But it's also important to approach such sensitive topics with empathy. The boyfriend's tone and choice of words might have been the main issue here. He didn't express his concerns in a way that acknowledges her situation or offers support. Instead, he criticized her lifestyle and choices, which led to her feeling hurt and devalued.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's plan, while maybe not as secure as a traditional job, isn't entirely unreasonable. Affiliate marketing through social media can be a legitimate income source, though it's more variable. The boyfriend's dismissal of her efforts (\"posting pics of her ass and tits\") is particularly unhelpful and disrespectful. It's not constructive to mock someone's potential income streams, even if he doubts their viability.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's intentions might be valid\u2014he wants her to be financially responsible. However, his method of communication was flawed. He could have discussed the concerns without belittling her or making her feel like a failure. The way he presented his arguments likely hurt her feelings and didn't foster collaboration. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the way he communicated his concerns rather than the content of the concerns themselves.\n"
