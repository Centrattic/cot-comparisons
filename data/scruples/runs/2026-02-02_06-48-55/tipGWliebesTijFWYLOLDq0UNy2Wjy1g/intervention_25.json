She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to become a productive member of society instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram for income. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a 22-year-old guy whose girlfriend is about to finish her master's. She hasn't had a job, gets an allowance from her parents, and plans to use that plus Instagram to cover moving in costs. He's pushing her to get a job, which she resists, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's concerned about financial responsibility. He wants her to be independent and not rely on her family or unstable income sources like affiliate marketing through social media. He's also worried that if they move in together, he might end up covering the remaining expenses if her plan doesn't work out. His argument is about financial stability and preparing her for the real world.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is coming from a supportive family and is transitioning from academia. She might feel that her plans are valid, especially if she's confident in growing her Instagram presence. She may not see her situation as problematic, especially if her peers are in similar positions. The author's criticism could hurt her feelings, making her feel judged or undervalued.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of their relationship. The author is making a financial and practical argument, but the way he expressed it might have been harsh. Phrases like \"don't just go to school for no reason\" or comments about her Instagram content can come across as disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the delivery might have been unkind, contributing to her feeling like a \"bum.\" \n\nFinancial independence is important, but relationships require sensitivity. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering her emotional state or the pressure she's under. It's possible he's right about the financial advice, but how he communicated it could be the issue. The girlfriend might need support in exploring job opportunities rather than being criticized for her current situation. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about her friends influencing her suggests that she's in an environment where traditional work isn't the norm, so his expectations might clash with her social circle. While it's reasonable to want her to have a stable income, the way he framed his argument could have been more empathetic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's main point is valid\u2014financial responsibility is crucial. However, his method of expressing this, particularly the harsh comments about her content and friends, might be where he's in the wrong. It's possible he's not the villain, but his approach could have been more compassionate. \n\nI think the key here is balancing practical advice with emotional support. The author isn't entirely wrong in his concerns, but his delivery and choice of words contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be that he's partially in the wrong due to the manner of his communication rather than the content of his message.\n"
