She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy (M22) who's telling his girlfriend (F23) she needs to get a job and be more productive instead of relying on her parents' allowance and her Instagram. She's about to get her master's and hasn't worked before. They're planning to move in together, and she wants to use her allowance and affiliate marketing on Instagram to cover her half. He's against that, wants her to get a job, and she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's reasoning is about financial responsibility and preparing her for the real world. He's worried she's not handling money properly and might depend on him. She's probably feeling judged or criticized for her lifestyle, which her family supports. Moving in together is a big step, and financial expectations are key here. \n\nThe guy's approach might be seen as harsh, especially if he criticized her for not having a job before. But he's also being realistic about their financial future. The girl might feel he's not understanding her situation or her chosen path (Instagram income). The question is whether his approach was wrong. \n\nSome might argue that while his intentions are good, the way he communicated it was hurtful. Others might think he's right to push for financial responsibility. The key factors are communication style, financial planning for a shared home, and mutual respect. If he dismissed her plans without support, that's a problem. But if he's trying to set realistic expectations for their future, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether his criticism was constructive or just condescending. If he's being judgmental and not considering alternatives she's exploring (like affiliate marketing), he's in the wrong. However, if he's making a valid point about financial stability, he's not. Since the girl is about to graduate, maybe she's planning to start her own career, and he's rushing her. The fact that he's using derogatory comments about her Instagram content (implied by the phrase \"posting pics of her ass and tits\") might be where the tone goes off. That's probably why she felt insulted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for the way he communicated his concerns, even if the concerns are valid. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the manner of delivery and the comments about her Instagram might have been disrespectful, even if his intentions were good.\n"
