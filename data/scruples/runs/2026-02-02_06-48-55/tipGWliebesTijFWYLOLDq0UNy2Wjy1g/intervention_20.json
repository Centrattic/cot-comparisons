She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation involves their girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and wanting to move in together with her paying half the rent using that allowance and her Instagram affiliate marketing.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about their girlfriend's financial independence and future. They want her to get a job because they think relying on her parents and Instagram isn't enough. The author is being honest about their financial expectations, especially since they're planning to live together. It's reasonable for them to want to ensure that their partner is contributing fairly and not expecting them to cover additional costs beyond the agreed rent split.\n\nHowever, the way the author communicated this might be an issue. They called her a \"bum,\" criticized her friends for not being in the real world, and made a comment about her using Instagram to post certain body parts. That's pretty harsh and could make her feel attacked. The author's approach seems confrontational rather than supportive. Even if the underlying concern is valid, the delivery might have been unkind and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has legitimate concerns about financial responsibility and future stability. They're not wrong to want their partner to be independent, especially if they're planning to live together. The problem might be in how they expressed those concerns without considering her feelings and circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's situation is that she's in a graduate program, hasn't worked before, and is transitioning into the job market. It's possible she's in a position where she's trying to explore different income streams, like affiliate marketing, which might not be as reliable as a traditional job. The author's push for her to get a job is understandable, but the way they dismissed her plans (calling her a bum, making judgments about her Instagram content) could have been hurtful and damaging to their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's concerns are valid, but their communication was harsh and disrespectful. The question is whether the validity of their concerns outweighs the negative way they expressed them. In relationships, how you communicate is as important as what you communicate. Even if the author is right about the financial aspects, the approach they took could be seen as the issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they delivered their message, even if their intentions were to encourage responsibility.\n"
