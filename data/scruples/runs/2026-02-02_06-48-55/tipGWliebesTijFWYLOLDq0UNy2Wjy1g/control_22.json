She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, about to graduate with a master's but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance. They want to move in together, and he's okay with her paying half the rent, but he's concerned she's relying on her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing instead of getting a job. He told her she needs to work, and she got upset, feeling he called her a bum.\n\nHmm, first, the guy's perspective is that he wants her to be financially responsible. He's right to be concerned about her financial stability, especially if they're moving in together. Maybe he's being realistic. But the way he approached it might have been harsh. He mentioned she's living off her parents and friends with wealthy families, which could come off as judgmental. Also, he criticized her Instagram content, which might be disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the delivery could have hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, she's graduating with a master's, which is a big achievement. She's planning to use her degree, but maybe she hasn't considered the practical side of entering the job market. Her relying on allowance and affiliate marketing might not be sustainable. The guy is trying to prepare her for real-world responsibilities. But is it his place to push her like that? Maybe he should have had a more supportive conversation instead of making her feel bad.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's right to care about their financial future, but his approach was condescending. He called her out publicly for not working, which could be seen as shaming her. That's not healthy in a relationship. Instead of telling her she's a bum, he could have discussed their goals and how they can support each other. Maybe he didn't respect her autonomy in choosing her path, even if he disagrees. The key is whether his criticism was constructive or just hurtful. Since she felt humiliated, he might be in the wrong for not handling it sensitively.\n\nAlso, the part where he mentions her Instagram content being just \"pics of her ass and tits\" is definitely disrespectful. Even if he thinks she's not making money that way, commenting on her body like that is inappropriate. That line of thinking could contribute to a toxic dynamic. So, while his concerns are valid, the way he communicated them was problematic. Therefore, he's in the wrong for the harsh and disrespectful approach.\n"
