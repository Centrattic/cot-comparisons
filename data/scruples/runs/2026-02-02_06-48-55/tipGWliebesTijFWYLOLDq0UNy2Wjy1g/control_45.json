She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's in a relationship with a girl who's about to finish her master's degree but has never had a job. She's getting a $1k allowance from her parents, and she plans to move in with him. She wants to cover half the rent and bills using her allowance and expand her Instagram for money. He's pushing her to get a job instead, saying she should be more productive and not rely on her parents. She got upset, called him names, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is concerned about financial stability. He's renting an apartment, and if she's not working, there's a risk she won't be able to contribute enough. He's trying to be realistic, pointing out that relying on allowance and maybe unstable income from Instagram might not be enough. He's also worried about future financial struggles and possibly him having to cover more expenses, even though he's earning a decent salary. It's about responsibility and preparing for reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that he's being critical of her lifestyle, which her family has supported. She's in a graduate program, which is a form of education, so maybe she's not in the workforce yet. Her plan to use Instagram could be a legitimate attempt to monetize her presence, though it's uncertain. He criticized her content (posts of her body) which might come off as dismissive or disrespectful. That could hurt her feelings, making her feel judged.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility vs. personal choices. The guy is right to be concerned about shared living expenses and financial stability. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh, especially if he made her feel like a \"bum\" or belittled her aspirations. The comment about her Instagram content being just pictures of her body could be seen as condescending and not supportive. \n\nFinancial planning is important in a relationship, especially when moving in together. It's reasonable to discuss how each partner will contribute. However, the approach taken here might have been lacking empathy. Instead of shaming her for her current situation, he could have suggested alternatives more constructively. The girl's reaction shows that his message might have been received as a personal attack rather than a practical discussion.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He has valid concerns about financial responsibility, but his method of addressing them could have been more supportive. The criticism about her Instagram content and the friends who don't work might be judgmental. The argument here is whether his intentions were right but the delivery wrong. The question is whether he's at fault for the way he expressed his concerns, not just the concerns themselves.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often look at whether the actions were respectful and considerate. Even if the concerns are valid, the way they're delivered matters. If he was dismissive of her plans without supporting discussion, that could be where he's wrong. The girl's feelings were hurt, which suggests that his approach had a negative impact. Therefore, even if his intentions were good, the way he handled it might make him the asshole.\n"
