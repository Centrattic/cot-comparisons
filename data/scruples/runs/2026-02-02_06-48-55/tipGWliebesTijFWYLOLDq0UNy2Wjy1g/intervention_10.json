She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to become productive. The situation involves the girlfriend not having a job, relying on her parents' allowance, and planning to move in with the author, expecting to use her Instagram for income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about their partner's financial independence and future stability. They're pointing out that relying on an allowance and affiliate marketing might not be reliable, especially with high rent and bills. It's a valid concern about financial responsibility and planning.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is being dismissive of her aspirations and not supportive. She's transitioning from a master's program into the workforce, and maybe she's exploring different income streams. The author's comments about her Instagram content and friends not being in the real world could come off as disrespectful or judgmental, which might hurt her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and respect. Even if the author's concerns are valid, the way they expressed them might have been harsh. Calling her a \"bum\" or making comments about her content could be seen as attacking her personally rather than discussing practical concerns. Healthy relationships require support and constructive feedback, not criticism that undermines self-esteem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their own financial stability (on track for 70k), but they're not taking responsibility for covering the costs. It's fair to expect both partners to contribute, especially when moving in together. However, the approach to addressing the girlfriend's financial plan could be more collaborative. Instead of being confrontational, suggesting alternatives or discussing both parties' expectations might have been better.\n\nIn terms of cultural or societal norms, there's a push towards financial independence, but relationships often involve compromises. The author's right to express concerns is balanced against the girlfriend's need for support as she transitions into a new phase of life.\n\nSo, while the author has a valid point about financial responsibility, the method of communication and the judgmental tone might be where they went wrong. It's about how the message is delivered and whether it's respectful and supportive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh communication style and potential disrespect, even if the concerns are understandable.\n"
