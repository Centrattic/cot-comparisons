She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 23, finishing her master's degree, and has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ monthly allowance. She plans to move in with him and pay half the rent using her allowance and expanding her Instagram for affiliate marketing. The author is against this, saying she needs a job instead.\n\nHe's concerned about financial stability. If she relies on the allowance and her part-time income from Instagram, she might not have enough left after rent and bills. He's worried she expects him to cover the rest, even though he's earning $70k. He wants her to get a full-time job to be independent and save money.\n\nNow, is he wrong? On one hand, he's being realistic. Financial independence is important, especially when moving in together. He's not okay with her relying on her parents' money and possibly expecting him to subsidize her lifestyle. He's encouraging her to take responsibility, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the way he delivered his message might have been harsh. He called her a \"bum,\" mentioned her Instagram content (posts of her \"ass and tits\"), and criticized her friends' lifestyles. That could have come off as condescending and hurtful. The girlfriend felt attacked, which is a red flag. Even if his intentions were good, the approach was probably too harsh and judgmental.\n\nHe also made assumptions about her expectations, like thinking she expects him to cover expenses. Maybe he should have discussed this more gently instead of being confrontational. Relationships require communication and empathy, not just blunt criticism.\n\nSo, while his concerns about financial responsibility are valid, the way he expressed them might be where he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the criticism was constructive or damaging. Since the girlfriend felt belittled and he used potentially degrading language, he might be at fault for not handling the conversation with more care and respect.\n"
