She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old guy whose girlfriend, a 23-year-old about to graduate with a master's, has never had a job and relies on a $1k+ monthly allowance from her parents. He's okay with her moving in but wants her to get a job instead of relying on her allowance and her Instagram for income, which she's planning to do via affiliate marketing. He's concerned that she won't make enough from her social media and that she might expect him to cover the shortfall, even though he's earning $70k this year. He criticized her for not being in the real world and her friends for the same, which upset her, leading her to say he's an asshole and make her feel like a bum.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern is about financial responsibility and the girlfriend's reliance on her parents' money. He's trying to set expectations for her to be independent when moving in together. But the way he communicated this might have been harsh. Telling someone they feel like a \"bum\" and that their friends are not in the \"real world\" could be hurtful. Maybe he could have approached it more sensitively, acknowledging her achievements while discussing practical steps.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is about to graduate with a master's, which is a significant academic achievement. The author might be right in thinking she should get a job, but the method of conveying that message matters. Instead of attacking her lifestyle or her friends', suggesting support or discussing how to transition into a job might have been better. The fact that her family is well-off might mean she hasn't had to work before, so it's a shift in expectations. However, the author's tone and choice of words likely contributed to her feeling criticized and judged.\n\nAnother angle: the author is okay with her paying half the rent, but her current plan doesn't cover it. He's trying to be responsible by making her self-sufficient. But the criticism about her Instagram content (posts of her body) might be a touchy subject. Even if he thinks she should get a job, pointing out the nature of her content could come off as disrespectful or dismissive of her efforts to monetize her account. Maybe there's a better way to express concern about her financial plan without focusing on the type of content she's posting.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend might be in a vulnerable position, as moving in with a partner is a big step and she's adjusting to new expectations. The author's approach here could be seen as not being supportive, using harsh language. Even if his intentions are good, the delivery can affect the outcome. So, while the author's concerns are valid, the way he expressed them may have been the issue. Therefore, he might be the asshole for being too harsh and not considering her feelings, even if he's not entirely wrong about the financial aspect.\n"
