She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to become a productive member of society. The situation is that she's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never had a job. Her parents give her a $1k+ allowance, and she plans to use that plus her Instagram affiliate marketing to cover half the rent when they move in. The author is against this, wants her to get a job, and points out the financial realities. She got upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's actions are justifiable. He's concerned about their financial future and wants her to be responsible. But did he go too far? He told her she's not working, criticized her friends, and made some potentially hurtful comments about her Instagram content. \n\nIs it wrong to encourage a partner to be financially independent? Probably not. It's reasonable for him to want her to contribute fairly, especially if he's making $70k. However, the way he delivered the message might be an issue. Calling her a \"bum\" and making comments about her Instagram posts could be hurtful and disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, the method of communication matters in relationships.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship dynamics, he might have overstepped by not being supportive of her plans. Maybe she's trying to figure out her career path, and his response was too harsh. The fact that she got really upset and felt attacked suggests that his approach was damaging to their relationship, regardless of the validity of his concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not wrong to point out financial realities. If they're going to live together, both should be responsible for their share. But the way he presented his argument might have been dismissive of her efforts and aspirations, which could make her feel undervalued. The key here is whether his criticism was constructive or just hurtful.\n\nIn summary, while his concerns about financial responsibility are valid, the manner in which he expressed them contributed to the conflict. He might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting her to be productive, but his approach was probably too harsh and disrespectful. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he communicated, even if his intentions were good.\n"
