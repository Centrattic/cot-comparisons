She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the guy is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she needs to be productive by getting a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and Instagram.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. She's about to finish her master's but has never had a job. Her family is wealthy, giving her over $1000 a month. They want to move in together, and she plans to use her parents' money and Instagram affiliate marketing to pay her half. He's pushing her to get a job, maybe even a minimum wage one, to be financially independent. He's concerned that relying on her allowance and side hustle isn't sustainable, and he doesn't want to end up paying for everything. She got upset, feeling called out as a \"bum,\" and they had a fight.\n\nSo, the main points here: Is it wrong to encourage someone to be more responsible financially, especially when moving in together? Or is he being too harsh, especially since her family supports her?\n\nOn one hand, he's being practical. Moving in with someone usually requires both to contribute fairly. If she's not working, relying on her parents' money might not be sustainable long-term. He's worried about financial stability and not wanting to subsidize her lifestyle. Also, his concerns about her financial planning (only a few hundred left after bills) are valid. He's trying to set realistic expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's being insensitive. She has a master's degree and might not want to take a minimum wage job. Maybe she's planning to use her skills or build her Instagram business, which could take time. Pressuring her could be seen as dismissive of her goals or capabilities. Also, his comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" seems harsh and degrading, even if he's being honest. That might have contributed to her feeling belittled.\n\nAnother angle: She's coming from a supportive family, so maybe she hasn't had to work yet. He's bringing her into the real world, which is a big transition. His approach might be too abrupt, causing emotional distress. Communication style matters here; instead of telling her she's a \"bum,\" maybe a more supportive approach would have been better.\n\nThe key here is whether his intentions are valid but his method is flawed. He's right to want financial responsibility, but the way he expressed it could have been hurtful. Also, the part about her Instagram content being a negative comment might be crossing a line. So, while his concerns are understandable, the way he delivered them might make him at fault.\n\nI think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the harsh comments and possibly not considering her feelings and her plans. But I'm a bit conflicted because the financial concerns are valid. However, the way he handled it is problematic.\n"
