She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy (M22) is telling his girlfriend (F23) that she should get a job instead of relying on her parents' allowance and trying to make money through Instagram. The key points here are about expectations in a relationship, financial responsibility, and how their communication went down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is about to finish her master's degree and has never worked a job. Her family is financially stable, giving her $1k+ a month. She wants to move in with him, and he's okay with her paying half the rent. But when she says she'll use her allowance and Instagram affiliate marketing, he pushes back, saying she should get a job. He's concerned she won't have enough money after rent and bills, and that she might expect him to cover the costs. He also mentions that her friends are similar, not in the real world, and that's why she's unaware of how things work. She got upset, feeling he's calling her a bum and being an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the guy is trying to set realistic expectations for their future. He's concerned about financial stability and doesn't want to be the one covering the expenses if she's not contributing. It's reasonable to want a partner to be independent and financially responsible, especially if they're planning to live together. His main points are about financial responsibility and moving into adulthood, which are valid concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He criticized her lifestyle, mentioned her Instagram content (posts of her body), and implied that her friends are not in the real world. That could have come off as insensitive or condescending, especially if she was not expecting such direct criticism. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her path or her confidence in her own plans. The fact that she's about to graduate with a master's degree also suggests she has some level of education, so his comment about her not working before might be seen as dismissing her educational achievements. \n\nThe key here is whether the criticism is valid but delivered in a hurtful way. Even if his concerns are based on reality, the way he expressed them may have made her feel attacked instead of being supportive. In relationships, how you communicate concerns is as important as the content. If he approached it with empathy, understanding her aspirations, and discussed the financial aspects without belittling her, it might have been more constructive. But the way he did it led to her feeling like a \"bum,\" which is damaging to the relationship.\n\nAlso, considering that she's relying on an allowance from her family, it's not necessarily wrong for her to do so, especially if her parents are willing to support her. However, when moving in together, splitting costs is a new dynamic, and he's right to question how she'll handle that. But the way he framed it as her needing to be a \"productive member of society\" could be seen as judgmental, especially if her idea of productivity (building an Instagram presence) isn't aligned with his traditional view of a job. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about financial responsibility and shared living expenses, the manner in which he expressed those concerns was likely hurtful and dismissive. That makes me think he's in the wrong because the problem isn't the criticism itself, but how it was delivered and the condescending tone. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
