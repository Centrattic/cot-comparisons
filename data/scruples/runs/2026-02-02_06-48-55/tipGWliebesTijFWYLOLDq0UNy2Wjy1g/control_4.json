She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's in a relationship with a woman who's about to graduate with a master's degree but has never worked a job. She's getting a $1k+ allowance from her parents, and they want to move in together. The guy is okay with her paying half the rent, but when she says she'll use her allowance and her Instagram to cover the costs, he pushes her to get a job instead. He's concerned about her financial stability and the potential for her to rely on him financially. She got upset and called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is trying to be responsible here. He's thinking about their future together and financial responsibilities. He's not okay with her not contributing in a stable way. It makes sense that he's worried about her relying on an uncertain income from Instagram, which might not be reliable compared to a regular job. He's even mentioned that she could have a good income with a minimum wage job plus her allowance, which would be more stable.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might feel that her partner is being dismissive of her plans and her potential. She's about to graduate, maybe she's confident in her ability to make money through Instagram or other methods. The guy's comment about her posting \"pics of her ass and tits\" could be hurtful and might have been unnecessary. Even if he's trying to be realistic, the way he communicated his concerns might have been harsh. He could have been more supportive of her exploring different ways to earn money, as long as they're realistic.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's coming from a family where she's been financially supported might mean she hasn't had to manage money on her own. The guy is pushing her to take on more responsibility, which is a good thing for a healthy relationship, but the method of communication is important. Insulting her efforts or her appearance, even if it's in jest, can be damaging.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were wrong. He's right to want her to be financially responsible, but the way he approached it might have been inconsiderate. The key points are his communication style and the judgmental comments. If he had expressed his concerns without attacking her or her methods, maybe she would have been more receptive. The fact that she felt like a \"bum\" suggests that his approach was hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, how you communicate your concerns matters. Even if the message is valid, the delivery can affect how it's received. So while the author's intentions might be good, his method could be at fault. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he hurt her feelings and didn't approach the conversation with empathy. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to consider if the underlying message is valid. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just if his message is right. Since the way he communicated it was harsh, the answer is likely A.\n"
