I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student had her underwear showing because she was putting her feet up on the desk. He tried to handle it by passing her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and job.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without embarrassing her. He considered other methods like talking after class or emailing but decided against them due to potential awkwardness or misinterpretation. The note was direct but not in a harassing way. The key question is whether his action was appropriate.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances. The teacher is a man, the student is a female student, and the content of the note could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting where interactions between teachers and students are scrutinized. Even though the teacher's intention was to help, the method might have been problematic. The note could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the student was unaware she was showing her underwear. The teacher might have assumed the student didn't know, but maybe she was doing it intentionally to flirt or test boundaries.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the teacher genuinely made an effort to inform her respectfully without any ulterior motive, it's hard to see him as in the wrong. The problem arises if the note could be perceived as a form of attention or harassment, especially given the power dynamics. The fact that the student and her friends now view him negatively suggests that the approach might not have been the best. Maybe a better approach would have been to speak to her privately after class in a professional manner, explaining the situation and asking her to adjust her clothing. The note was direct but public in the sense that others might have noticed the exchange, leading to rumors.\n\nConsidering all this, the teacher's action was meant to be helpful, but the method could have been better. However, he didn't act with malice. The student's reaction and the resulting tension are more about perception and how the action was received. Since the teacher didn't make any inappropriate comments beyond the note and there's no indication of harassment, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a risk in the method chosen. However, given the options, the teacher's intention was appropriate, so the answer is B.\n"
