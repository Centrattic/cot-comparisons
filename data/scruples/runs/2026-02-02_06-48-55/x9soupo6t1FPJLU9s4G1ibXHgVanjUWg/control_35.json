I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a female student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which made the student and her friends give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the teacher's actions. The teacher is a 30-year-old male, and the student is a female upperclassman. The main issue here is the way he addressed the situation. While the problem of the student showing her underwear is something that might need to be addressed, the method matters a lot in a professional setting like a school.\n\nPassing a note directly to the student might seem like a private way to handle it, but the content of the note could be problematic. The note specifically mentions \"your underwear is showing,\" which, while factual, might be perceived as a sexual comment. Even if the teacher's intention was to inform her without embarrassment, the phrasing could be seen as inappropriately focused on her body, especially from a teacher to a student. \n\nAlso, the student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends suggest that the message didn't come across as neutral or professional. In a school environment, teachers need to maintain clear boundaries and avoid any communication that could be misinterpreted as sexual or harassing. The note might have crossed a line by directly referencing the underwear, making it a potential issue for both the teacher and the student's comfort.\n\nAnother angle is the teacher's concern about calling her out publicly. Using a note might have been an attempt to keep it private, but perhaps there's a more appropriate way to address it. For example, the teacher could have mentioned something about proper desk etiquette or clothes not being suitable for the current activity without specifying the underwear. That way, the message is about behavior and clothing, not the undergarments. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the power dynamic. A teacher has a position of authority over students, so any personal or potentially suggestive communication can be problematic. Even if the note was meant to be helpful, the content combined with the age difference and professional relationship might lead to perceptions of impropriety, regardless of the teacher's intent.\n\nThe fact that the student continued the behavior after the note implies that maybe she wasn't aware, but the teacher's approach could have been more tactful. Maybe a non-specific comment about her seating posture or clothing, without referencing the undergarments directly. Alternatively, following school policy on such matters, which might involve speaking with the student privately or involving a staff member if necessary.\n\nSince there's no mention of any formal complaint or action from the school, the teacher might not be in trouble yet, but the social repercussions among students are concerning. The perception here is key\u2014colleagues, students, or even authorities might interpret the note as a teacher making a sexualized remark, which could lead to serious consequences even if the teacher had good intentions.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the teacher's note, while intended to address a modesty issue, was phrased in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A) because the communication method and content are risky in a professional teacher-student context.\n"
