I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher did something wrong by telling a student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, the teacher is male, and the student is female. The situation is that the student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher noticed this multiple times and decided to pass a note saying her underwear is showing. The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now her and her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The teacher's intention was to address the situation politely without calling her out in front of others. He considered other options like talking after class or emailing but worried about how it might be perceived. A note seems like a private way to handle it. However, there's a concern about the power dynamic between a teacher and student. The teacher is in a position of authority, and any communication about personal appearance can be sensitive.\n\nBut the student was the one who was inadvertently showing her underwear repeatedly. The teacher's action was to inform her, not to harass. The note was direct but non-confrontational. However, the student and her friends might have taken offense, possibly thinking the teacher was objectifying her, even if that wasn't his intent. \n\nIn some cases, a teacher might handle it by talking to the student in private, maybe during a break or after class, rather than using a note. But the note was a way to avoid public embarrassment. However, the note could still be seen as inappropriate because it's a teacher commenting on a student's clothing, which could lead to rumors or misunderstandings, especially given the power imbalance.\n\nAlso, the teacher might have considered if the school has specific protocols for such situations, like involving a female staff member or using a more formal channel. But since there's no mention of that, it's hard to say. However, the fact that the student changed her behavior after the note suggests that the teacher's intention was to correct the situation, not to make a comment on her appearance.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the method was appropriate. A note might not be the best approach because it's a written message from a teacher to a student about their clothing, which can be misinterpreted. The teacher might have been better off addressing it verbally in a private, non-threatening setting. The note could be seen as a violation of privacy or as a form of harassment, even if the intention was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it discreetly, which is commendable. The problem is that the method might not have been the best given the context. The student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks indicate that the approach might have been misjudged. There's a risk of the teacher being perceived as inappropriate regardless of intent.\n\nIn terms of professional conduct, teachers should avoid any situation where their actions could be misunderstood. Even if the teacher's intention was to inform, the act of writing a note about a student's underwear is risky. The school might have policies against such direct communication from teachers to students about their clothing. In some places, this might be considered a breach of professional boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher might be in the wrong because the method of communication was inappropriate, even if the intent was correct. The power dynamic and the nature of the message could lead to accusations of harassment or inappropriate behavior. The teacher should have used a different approach, perhaps involving a colleague or addressing it more formally.\n"
