I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the teacher is male, the student is female. She's wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which causes her underwear to be visible. The teacher passes a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacts negatively, and her friends now give him dirty looks. He's worried about his reputation and job.\n\nI need to determine if the teacher acted inappropriately. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Intent**: The teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without confrontation. He tried multiple methods (email, holding her back) but opted for a note to avoid embarrassment. That seems reasonable.\n\n2. **Method**: Using a note is a private way to communicate. Publicly calling her out might have been humiliating, so the note was a middle ground. However, the note itself is direct but not explicit beyond the message.\n\n3. **Power Dynamics**: The teacher is an authority figure, so any interaction with a student, especially regarding personal matters, can be sensitive. Even though the note was about clothing, the power imbalance exists. The student might feel targeted or harassed, even if the teacher's intent was good.\n\n4. **Alternatives Considered**: The teacher thought about other methods but chose the note. However, maybe there's a better approach. For example, using a general note about appropriate desk behavior instead of directly mentioning underwear. That way, it's about conduct, not the student's attire specifically. Or addressing the behavior (feet on the desk) rather than the clothing.\n\n5. **Student's Reaction**: The student scoffed and put her feet down, but her and her friends now view the teacher negatively. This could lead to rumors. The teacher's action, while well-meaning, might not have been the best approach given the potential for misinterpretation.\n\n6. **Professional Standards**: Some schools have policies about communication with students. Sending a note might be acceptable, but the content could be an issue. Teachers should avoid any communication that could be perceived as inappropriate, even if it's innocent.\n\n7. **Possible Misinterpretations**: The phrase \"your underwear is showing\" is explicit. A student might take it as a teacher fixating on her body, leading to accusations of harassment. The teacher's age (30) and the student being an upperclassman (likely 16-18) adds to the concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher had a good intention to correct the student's behavior, the method might not have been the best. Addressing the behavior (feet on the desk) instead of the clothing could avoid personalizing the issue. The direct mention of underwear, even in a note, could be seen as crossing a boundary. The teacher might not be in the wrong legally (since no superiors have acted), but professionally, there's room for improvement in handling the situation.\n"
