I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, showing her underwear. He tried ignoring it for a few days, but when she kept doing it, he decided to pass a note saying her underwear was showing. The student then got angry, and her friends started giving him dirty looks. The teacher is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without making a scene. The student, however, might have felt embarrassed or targeted. The note itself was direct but not inappropriate in content. However, there's a power dynamic here: a teacher communicating with a student about their body can be sensitive. The method of passing a note might have been unexpected and could have been misinterpreted. The student's reaction suggests she felt humiliated. \n\nBut the teacher did try to handle it discreetly, considering other options like holding her after class or emailing, which could have been more awkward or looked worse. The fact that there's no mention of any official complaints from school authorities implies that maybe the action wasn't a violation of policy. However, the teacher's approach might have been too direct without considering the student's feelings. Maybe a less personal method, like a general reminder to the class about dress code, could have been better. But since the teacher didn't know the student was aware of the issue, addressing her directly might have been necessary. It's a tricky situation where the teacher's intent was good, but the execution might have caused unintended offense. So, it's a judgment call. The teacher isn't in the wrong for trying to address the situation respectfully, but could have handled it differently to avoid embarrassment. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
