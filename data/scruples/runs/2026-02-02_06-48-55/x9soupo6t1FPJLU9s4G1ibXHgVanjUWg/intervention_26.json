I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The scenario is that the student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which led to the student and her friends giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. He mentions being uncomfortable but initially ignored it. Then he tried different approaches but settled on a note. His goal was to inform the student without singling her out publicly, which makes sense. However, passing a note about underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially since he's a male teacher and the student is a female student. There's a potential for misinterpretation here. Even if the student was unaware, the note itself could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nSchool policies usually have strict guidelines about teacher-student interactions, especially regarding personal matters. Emailing or speaking with the student's parent might have been a better approach, or addressing it through the school's administrative channels. The teacher might not have considered that the note could be viewed as unprofessional or inappropriate, regardless of intent. The fact that the student and her friends now see him as a creep suggests that the method of delivery was problematic. So, while the teacher's intent was to help, the way he did it could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
