I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher did the right thing here. So the situation is: a male teacher notices that a female student is sitting in the front row wearing a skirt, puts her feet up on the desk, showing her underwear. He finds it uncomfortable but ignores it. Then the student continues to do this with different outfits, and he realizes she might not be aware. He wants to tell her but is worried about how to approach it without making her uncomfortable or causing rumors. He ends up passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" She reacts by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now he's facing dirty looks and potential rumors.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student in a private way so she could adjust. He considered other methods like holding her back or emailing, which could have been more awkward or attention-drawing. The note was direct but discreet. Now, the problem is that the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. But the key question is whether he violated any professional boundaries or did something inappropriate.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, the teacher's job includes creating a respectful and safe environment. If the student's actions are causing discomfort (either for the teacher or others), it's reasonable for the teacher to address it. However, the method of communication might matter. The note was direct and to the point, but maybe a better approach would be to use a more formal or neutral way, like a general rule about desk conduct that applies to everyone. However, in this case, the teacher was trying to avoid public embarrassment for the student, which is commendable.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Teachers have a responsibility to avoid any situation that could be misinterpreted. Even though the teacher's intent was appropriate, some might argue that discussing a student's clothing in this way could be seen as overstepping, especially if the student didn't realize she was showing her underwear. However, the teacher's action was to inform her to prevent others from seeing, not to make a personal comment.\n\nAlso, considering the student's age, if she's an upperclassman, she's likely in their late teens, so the teacher is dealing with minors. The method of passing a note is a common practice in schools for quick, private communication. But there's also the risk that the student or others might perceive it as inappropriate, even if it's not. The teacher's concern about rumors affecting his career is valid because in such environments, rumors can spread quickly, and perceptions often matter more than intentions.\n\nIn terms of professional ethics, teachers should avoid situations that could lead to misunderstandings. However, in this case, the teacher was trying to address a behavior that could be distracting or make others uncomfortable. If the student's actions are violating dress code or creating a distraction, the teacher is within his rights to address it. The method might not have been perfect, but the intent was appropriate.\n\nSo, the debate here is whether the teacher overstepped by personally addressing the underwear issue. If he had addressed it in a more general way, maybe through school policy, it might have been better. But since he tried to be discreet, maybe he did the best he could. However, the fact that the student and her friends now see him as a creep suggests that the approach might have been misinterpreted, regardless of his intent. The question is whether the approach was unprofessional, which could depend on school policies and cultural context.\n\nIn some schools, teachers might have specific guidelines on how to handle such situations. If there's a policy against direct comments on students' attire, then the teacher might be in the wrong. But if the policy allows for addressing dress code violations directly, then he's justified. Since the scenario doesn't mention a specific dress code violation, it's possible that the student's actions weren't against the rules, but rather a personal choice that the teacher found uncomfortable.\n\nIn summary, the teacher's intent was to inform the student of an issue that could be distracting, and he tried to do it discreetly. However, the method might have been too direct or personal, leading to misinterpretation. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions violated school policies or professional standards. If there's no policy against it, then he's not in the wrong. But if the way he handled it breached professional boundaries, then he might be.\n"
