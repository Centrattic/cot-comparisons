I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school educator who noticed a female student showing her underwear multiple times by sitting with her feet up on the desk. He tried different methods to address it without directly confronting her in front of others, like passing a note. The student reacted with a scoff and stopped, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his career.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the teacher is in the wrong. The key points here are about appropriate boundaries, the method of communication, and potential professional repercussions. \n\nThe teacher's intention was to inform the student politely about her exposure, which is a valid concern. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. Passing a note that says \"your underwear is showing\" could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate, especially given the teacher-student dynamic. Even if the intention was good, the message itself is personal and could be misinterpreted. \n\nAnother angle is the student's awareness. The teacher assumes she doesn't know, but maybe she's doing it intentionally. If that's the case, the note might be seen as prying. Also, the teacher's methods of addressing it (note, not confronting her directly) might be contributing to the misunderstanding. \n\nLegally and professionally, there's a line between addressing a student's behavior and crossing into inappropriate territory. High school is a sensitive environment, and any direct communication between a teacher and a student, especially about personal matters, can be scrutinized. Even if he's not in trouble now, there's a risk if the situation escalates. \n\nThe student's reaction (dirty looks, friends' reactions) suggests that the note might have been perceived as a creep move. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because in a school setting, such incidents can be taken out of context and damage a teacher's reputation, regardless of intent. \n\nConsidering all this, while the teacher's intention was to correct a wardrobe malfunction, the method used could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the approach taken was inappropriate given the power dynamics and the potential for misinterpretation.\n"
