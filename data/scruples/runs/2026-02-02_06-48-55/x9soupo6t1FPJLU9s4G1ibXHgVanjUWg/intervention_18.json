I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. He tried to ignore it at first but then decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now he's worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the teacher's actions. The teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassing her in front of others, which is a valid concern. However, the method of passing a note might have been problematic. The content of the note is direct and personal, which could be seen as inappropriate given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher's intention was pure, the communication method might have violated professional boundaries.\n\nNext, there's the context of the student's behavior. She was repeatedly wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which the teacher assumed she didn't realize was causing the issue. The teacher didn't confront her in person, which might have been a better approach. Maybe a discreet, in-person conversation could have been handled more professionally. However, the teacher did try to avoid public embarrassment, which is a good effort.\n\nThe teacher is worried about rumors and his career, which is understandable. If a student and her friends now see him as a creep, that's a significant consequence. The note might have been misinterpreted as harassment or inappropriate behavior, even if it wasn't intended that way. The school's policies on teacher-student interactions would likely frown upon such direct notes about a student's clothing.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. A note about a student's attire could be seen as overstepping, especially in the context of a teacher-student relationship. Even if the teacher's intention was to help, the method might not align with professional standards. The school might not have taken action yet, but that doesn't mean there's no risk. The teacher's approach could have been perceived as intrusive or inappropriate, potentially leading to more serious consequences if reported.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the teacher's actions, while well-intentioned, crossed a line in terms of professionalism. The note was a direct and personal message that could be misinterpreted, especially in the context of the power imbalance. The appropriate approach might have been to address the behavior more discreetly through a face-to-face conversation, perhaps in a professional setting, to avoid any miscommunication. Therefore, the teacher is in the wrong.\n"
