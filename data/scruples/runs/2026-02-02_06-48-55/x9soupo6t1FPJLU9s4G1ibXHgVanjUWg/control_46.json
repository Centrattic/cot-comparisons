I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing by passing a note. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The teacher is male, the student is female. She was wearing skirts and had her feet up, showing her underwear multiple times. The teacher tried different ways to address it but settled on a note. The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the teacher acted inappropriately. Let me break it down. The teacher noticed the student was showing her underwear, which he found uncomfortable. He tried to handle it without making her feel embarrassed or singled out. He considered various methods but went with a note. \n\nBut wait, is it the teacher's responsibility to point out a student's clothing choices? Some might say yes, because it's a professional duty to maintain a respectful environment. Others might argue that it's a personal matter and the teacher should not be involved. \n\nAlso, the method he used\u2014a note\u2014could be seen as direct but maybe invasive. However, the note was brief and to the point. The problem arises when the student and her friends perceive it as harassment. Even if the teacher's intention was just to inform, the student might feel targeted. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher didn't report or escalate the issue, which is good. But maybe he should have approached it differently. For example, maybe talking to the student in private without peers around, but he was concerned about her friends finding out. Alternatively, using a general reminder to the class about appropriate desk conduct might have been better, rather than a personal note. \n\nThere's also the aspect of gender dynamics. A male teacher pointing out a female student's clothing could be misinterpreted, especially given the power imbalance in a teacher-student relationship. Even if the teacher's intention was innocent, the action could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nHowever, the teacher did handle it discreetly, which shows he was trying to be respectful. The fact that he was uncomfortable but initially ignored it might suggest he didn't want to make a scene. He did consider other methods and chose the least invasive one he thought possible. \n\nIs there a policy about this? In some schools, there are strict guidelines on communication between teachers and students, including what constitutes appropriate interaction. If the school has a policy against personal notes about appearance, then he might be in the wrong. But without knowing that, it's hard to say. \n\nThe key point is that the student felt targeted, and her friends are now treating the teacher poorly. The teacher's main concern is about rumors and his career. But the question is about whether he was in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the teacher's action was intended to correct a situation he found uncomfortable. However, the method might not have been the best. Maybe he should have addressed it by talking to the student in a more formal setting, or perhaps by discussing proper desk conduct with the whole class. Using a note might be seen as overstepping because it's a private matter and could be perceived as focusing on her body, which is not appropriate in a professional context. \n\nBut again, the alternative is that the teacher is just trying to maintain a professional environment. If the student was repeatedly showing her underwear, it's a legitimate concern for a teacher to address. The problem is the method and the potential for misinterpretation. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural and institutional norms. In some contexts, it's acceptable for a teacher to address such a situation. In others, it's not. Given that the student and her friends now view him negatively, it suggests that the method used wasn't appropriate in their eyes. So, the teacher might have acted in a way that, while well-intentioned, was not the best approach. \n\nTherefore, the teacher could be in the wrong for handling it via a note instead of a more formal, discreet conversation. However, considering the alternatives he thought of, maybe he didn't have a better option. But the fact that the student and friends reacted negatively implies that the note was not the right approach. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method of communication (note) could be seen as inappropriate given the power dynamics and potential for misinterpretation.\n"
