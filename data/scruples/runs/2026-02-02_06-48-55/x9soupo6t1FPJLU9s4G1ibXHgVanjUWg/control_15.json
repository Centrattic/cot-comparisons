I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher. The situation involves a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to show. The teacher noticed this, tried to ignore it, but eventually passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but then the teacher started getting dirty looks from her and her friends.\n\nFirst, the teacher's main concern is about professional boundaries and how his actions might be perceived. He's worried about rumors and his reputation. The key question here is whether his action of passing the note was appropriate.\n\nIn a professional setting, especially involving a teacher and a student, any communication that could be perceived as inappropriate or with ulterior motives is risky. The teacher's intention was to inform the student about her appearance, which he considered a polite way to handle it. However, the method he chose\u2014a note about underwear\u2014could be seen as overstepping, regardless of his actual intent. \n\nEven if the student was unaware of her exposure, the teacher's role is to maintain a respectful and professional environment. There are standard ways to address such issues, like a private, discreet conversation in a public setting or suggesting she adjust her clothing without mentioning the underwear. The note might come off as too direct and personal, especially given the power dynamic between teacher and student. \n\nMoreover, the student's reaction (scoffing) and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends suggest that the approach didn't work well. The teacher might have considered other methods, like addressing it in front of the class in a general way (e.g., asking students to keep legs down during class), which would avoid singling out the student and reduce the risk of misinterpretation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of potential for misunderstanding. A 30-year-old teacher sending a note about underwear to a student could be misconstrued, even if the intention was innocent. Schools often have strict policies about communication between teachers and students to prevent any appearance of impropriety. The teacher might not be in legal trouble since no one has contacted him, but the perception is still a problem. \n\nSo, while the teacher's intention was to be helpful, the method was questionable. The correct approach would have been to address the behavior in a way that maintains professional boundaries and doesn't involve a personal note about the student's clothing. Therefore, the answer would be that the teacher is in the wrong because the handling of the situation was inappropriate given the context and potential perceptions.\n"
