I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher is asking if he's in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe teacher is male, and a student was repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet on the desk. He tried different ways to address it without confrontation, finally using a note. But the student and her friends now look at him negatively. The teacher is worried about his reputation and potential career impact.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the teacher in the wrong? Let me break it down. The student was unaware she was showing her underwear. The teacher's intention was to correct her, not to harass. He tried to handle it privately and respectfully. However, sending a note about underwear might come off as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the message could be misinterpreted. There's a risk of it being seen as a violation of privacy or a sexual comment. In some cases, this could lead to accusations, even if unintended. The teacher might have considered other methods, like talking to the student in private during a break or after class, but he was concerned about calling her out. However, using a note might not be the best approach. Schools often have policies on how to handle such situations, maybe involving speaking to the student in a professional manner. The fact that the student and friends gave him dirty looks shows that the method didn't work well. Also, the teacher's age (30) and the student's age could be a factor. The teacher's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent was to help. There's a potential for the situation to escalate, which the teacher is worried about. So, even though the teacher's intention was correct, the method might have been unwise. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because the approach taken could be perceived as inappropriate regardless of intent.\n"
