I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He first ignored it, but then tried passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, making him worried about his reputation.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. First, the situation: the teacher is trying to address a student's wardrobe choice. The student is in a skirt, feet up on the desk, leading to accidental exposure. The teacher's intention was to help her without embarrassing her. He considered different methods (after class, email) but went with a note. \n\nNow, is passing a note about underwear appropriate? From a professional standpoint, teachers need to maintain boundaries. Even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. A note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a professional setting with a student. It's possible that the note, while meant to help, could be perceived as overstepping or even predatory, given the power dynamic. \n\nThe student's reaction was scoffing and then putting her feet down, but the aftermath led to her and friends giving dirty looks. That suggests she might feel the note was an invasion of privacy or that the teacher shouldn't have commented. Even if the teacher's intent was correct, the action itself might be inappropriate. There's also the potential for the note to be misinterpreted, especially in an environment where teacher-student interactions are scrutinized. \n\nAlternatives could include discussing it during a time when the student is alone, perhaps privately after class, or using a more general approach without referencing the underwear specifically. Maybe a note that's more about appropriate desk behavior rather than the exposure itself. \n\nGiven the teacher's concern about rumors and career impact, it's clear that the method chosen has consequences. Even if no one reported it, the perception matters. In a school setting, such a note could lead to questions about professionalism. So, while the teacher's intention was to help, the way he handled it could be seen as in the wrong because it involved a personal and potentially sensitive topic in a way that's not standard procedure. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
