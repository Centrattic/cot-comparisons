I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt with her feet on the desk, showing her underwear. He passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to help the student avoid an embarrassing situation. He tried different methods and went with a note to avoid confrontation. But the student reacted negatively, and others are now viewing the teacher as a creep. \n\nBut wait, in a professional setting, especially in education, interactions between teachers and students must be very careful. Even if the teacher's intention was benign, passing a note about a student's underwear could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible the student didn't realize she was showing, but the method of correction might not be the best. \n\nTeachers are expected to maintain professional boundaries. Even if the note was meant to help, the content is personal and could be misinterpreted. The student might feel embarrassed or targeted, leading to resentment. The teacher's approach might not have considered the student's privacy and the potential for the note to be seen as intrusive. \n\nAlso, there's a power dynamic here. The teacher is in a position of authority, so even a simple note could be problematic if it's about a student's personal clothing. It's possible that the teacher should have spoken to her privately in a professional manner rather than using a note, which might have been better to avoid any perception of impropriety.\n\nBut then again, the teacher didn't make a sexual advance or do anything overtly wrong. The act of pointing out something that's visible could be seen as a minor issue. However, the method might not be professional. Maybe the teacher should have addressed it in a different way, like a general reminder about appropriate dress codes or sitting positions without singling out the student.\n\nIn any case, the key here is whether the teacher overstepped. The note might have been unnecessary. Perhaps the school has a dress code policy that the teacher could have referenced instead. By handling it directly, the teacher might have put himself in a vulnerable position where any misstep could be blown out of proportion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher's action was meant to help but crossed into personal territory in a way that's unprofessional. Therefore, the answer might be that the teacher is in the wrong because the method of communication was inappropriate given the professional relationship required.\n"
