I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher. He noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which exposed her underwear. He says he ignored it at first, but after several instances, he decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's consider the context. The student was repeatedly showing her underwear by placing her feet on the desk while wearing skirts or shorts. The teacher's intention was to inform her discreetly. The method he chose was a note during class. However, the student might have felt embarrassed or targeted. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries and communication with students. Passing a note about a student's underwear, even if the intention was to help, might be seen as inappropriate. There's a risk that the message could be misinterpreted, especially given the power dynamics in a teacher-student relationship. \n\nAlternative actions could have been better. For instance, speaking to the student privately after class, using a more generic warning like \"please adjust your clothing,\" or addressing the behavior without mentioning the underwear. Emailing might have been a less direct but more formal approach, but the teacher was concerned about how it might look. \n\nHowever, the student's behavior was also an issue. Wearing skirts and sitting in a way that exposes underwear could be considered a lack of awareness of modesty or school dress code. But the teacher's responsibility is to address such situations professionally. \n\nIn this case, while the teacher's intention was to help, the method used\u2014directly mentioning the underwear in a note\u2014could be seen as overstepping, leading to the student's negative reaction and potential rumors. The teacher might have acted in the student's interest but in a way that breached professional boundaries. Therefore, the teacher could be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, despite his good intentions.\n"
