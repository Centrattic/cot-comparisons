I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is that a student kept showing her underwear by putting her feet on the desk, and the teacher passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, and the student is female. He noticed this over multiple instances and tried different ways to address it without being too obvious. He finally used a note during class. The key here is whether his actions were appropriate.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries and handle situations respectfully. However, in this case, the teacher is addressing a student's clothing choice, which is a common issue. The method he used\u2014a discreet note\u2014is a standard approach to avoid embarrassment. The issue is that the student and her friends perceived it differently, maybe feeling targeted or embarrassed. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the teacher is not at fault. He didn't make any inappropriate comments beyond the note, and he tried to handle it privately. There's no indication of harassment or any malicious intent. The problem arises more from the student's reaction and possible misinterpretation rather than the teacher's actions. \n\nHowever, maybe the teacher could have handled it differently. For example, after class or during office hours, a private conversation might have been better. But passing a note is a common method to avoid public embarrassment. The main point is that the teacher acted in a professional manner to correct a situation where the student was unaware of her appearance. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B. The teacher is not in the wrong. He took a reasonable step to address an issue without overstepping. The student's reaction and potential rumors are unfortunate, but the teacher's actions were justified.\n"
