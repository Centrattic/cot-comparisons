I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The teacher is male, the student is female. The situation involves the student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. The teacher passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which caused the student and her friends to give him dirty looks.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The teacher noticed this over multiple days, tried different ways to address it without being confrontational. He didn't want to embarrass the student, which is understandable. But passing a note about underwear in a high school setting might be problematic. \n\nWait, the teacher is a 30-year-old male, and the student is an upperclassman. The note could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a professional setting. Even if the teacher's intention was to correct the student without causing a scene, the act of passing such a note could be misinterpreted. There's a power dynamic here; the teacher is an authority figure, and the student is a minor. The teacher's actions, though perhaps well-intentioned, might come off as crossing a boundary. \n\nAlso, the teacher considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing, but opted for a note. The problem is that the note could be seen as a private, direct communication about a personal matter. In some contexts, this might be considered unprofessional. Even if the teacher isn't in trouble according to the student's account, the perception from the student's side is that the teacher is acting inappropriately. \n\nAnother angle: the student might not have realized she was showing her underwear, so the teacher's note was a way to inform her. But maybe the teacher should have addressed it in a different way, such as through a general reminder about appropriate attire or a private conversation without focusing on the underwear specifically. \n\nHowever, the teacher did mention that the student repeated the behavior, indicating she might not be aware. The note was a direct and discreet way to inform her. But in a school setting, there are policies about teacher-student interactions. If the note wasn't part of a documented procedure, it might not have been the right approach. \n\nBut the key question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The user thinks the teacher is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes) and B (No). \n\nConsidering the power imbalance and the potential for misinterpretation, even if the teacher's intention was good, the action might be seen as inappropriate. Teachers should avoid situations where there's potential for misunderstanding. The note could be seen as a breach of professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be A. \n\nBut some might argue that the teacher was trying to be respectful and not embarrass the student, so B could be a case. But given the potential for the situation to be viewed as unprofessional, I think A is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
