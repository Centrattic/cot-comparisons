I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that a female student kept putting her feet up on the desk in skirts, causing her underwear to show. The teacher passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing\" during worksheets. The student scoffed and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional standards for teachers. Teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries and avoid any situations that could be perceived as harassment or inappropriate behavior. Even if the teacher's intention was to correct the student politely, the method might be problematic. \n\nPassing a note about a student's underwear could be misinterpreted. The note itself is direct and personal, and even though the message is simple, it's about the student's private clothing. A student might take such a note as a compliment or as a means to embarrass them. Given that the student is a minor and the teacher is in a position of authority, any communication about the student's body can be sensitive. \n\nAlso, the teacher considered other methods like holding her after class or emailing, which he thought might look bad. However, the note might still look bad, as it's a private message from a teacher to a student about their undergarments. The fact that the student and her friends now see him as a creep suggests that the approach was not well-received. \n\nEven if the teacher was uncomfortable and tried to handle it in a non-confrontational way, the method of communication could be seen as invasive. There's a risk of the note being taken the wrong way, especially in a school setting where such interactions need to be professional. \n\nMoreover, the teacher's concern about rumors and career implications indicates he's aware of potential issues. The key here is whether the action was appropriate. While the intention was to address a non-consensual exposure, the way it was done could be seen as violating the student's privacy or creating an uncomfortable situation. \n\nIn most school policies, teachers should handle such situations by addressing the behavior without commenting on the student's body. Instead of a note about the underwear, the teacher should have reminded her about classroom behavior and the appropriateness of her attire, perhaps in a private conversation. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the teacher is in the wrong (option A) because the method of communication was unprofessional and could be perceived as harassment, regardless of intent. The note about underwear is too personal and direct, especially from a teacher to a student.\n"
