I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is that a female student was repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk while wearing skirts. The teacher tried different ways to address it without making her feel called out, finally passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female, and the interaction is in a school setting. The teacher's actions were to address the student's behavior, which he found uncomfortable. He didn't report it to higher-ups but tried to handle it privately. The key points here are whether the teacher's method was appropriate and if there's any violation of boundaries.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers should maintain appropriate boundaries with students. Direct communication might be necessary, but the method can affect perceptions. The teacher used a note, which is a direct but discreet way. However, the content of the note could be seen as overly personal or invasive. Some might argue that the teacher should have addressed it more formally, like speaking to the student in private after class or involving a supervisor if necessary. Others might say that the teacher was justified in addressing a situation that made him uncomfortable and that his approach was respectful.\n\nBut there's also the risk of how it's perceived. The student and her friends now think he's a creep, which could lead to misunderstandings. The teacher's main concern is the potential for a rumor that could end his career. However, the question is whether he was in the wrong. The fact that he didn't report it to authorities might be a point against him, but he did try to resolve it privately. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the student was the one engaging in the behavior that caused discomfort. The teacher acted to correct it, which is his duty to maintain a respectful classroom environment. However, the method might not have been the most professional. Maybe a more formal approach, such as speaking to the student privately without making it a public issue but in a professional manner, would have been better. But the teacher's intention was to address the issue without embarrassing the student, which is commendable.\n\nIn some cases, passing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate due to the personal nature of the message. The concern is whether this could be misinterpreted, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the message might have crossed a line. However, the alternative of not addressing it could lead to ongoing discomfort for the teacher and possibly the student if she's unaware.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the teacher's approach was professional enough. While the intention was to correct the student's behavior, the method chosen (a note about underwear) might be seen as inconsiderate of the boundaries. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for not using a more formal method. However, others might argue that it was a reasonable attempt to handle it discreetly. \n\nBut in professional settings, especially with minors, it's important to avoid any actions that could be misinterpreted. Therefore, the teacher's approach, while well-meaning, may have been unwise. The correct answer would be that the teacher is in the wrong (A) because the method chosen could lead to misunderstandings and doesn't follow best practices for addressing such situations.\n"
