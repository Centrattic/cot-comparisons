I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear multiple times by having her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it but finally used a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student without making her embarrassed or causing a scene. He considered various methods and chose a note as a discreet way. But the student reacted negatively, leading to tension. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is the teacher in the wrong? Well, the student was repeatedly showing her underwear, which is a privacy issue. The teacher had a responsibility to address it since it's inappropriate. The method he used\u2014a note\u2014was direct but perhaps not the best approach. However, given that he tried to handle it privately, he's trying to avoid public embarrassment. \n\nBut there are alternative ways. Maybe speaking to her after class without prying on the spot, or even suggesting she adjust her clothing. However, considering the situation, the note was a way to communicate without confrontation. The problem might be that even though his intent was good, the perception is that he's overstepping, especially as a male teacher addressing a female student about such a personal matter. That could lead to misunderstandings, especially in a sensitive environment like a school. \n\nSchool policies often have strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. Emailing might not be appropriate, but a note in class might be seen as a better approach. However, the fact that the student and her friends are now hostile suggests that the method might not have been the best. But the teacher wasn't aware of other options, and his intent wasn't to harass. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the student was the one showing her underwear repeatedly, so the teacher had a duty to address it. The method might be debatable, but the intent was correct. However, in a professional setting, a teacher should probably follow official channels, like speaking to the student privately after class or involving a female staff member if possible, to avoid any appearance of impropriety. \n\nBut in this case, the teacher chose a note to be discreet. Since he's a male teacher and the student is female, even well-intentioned actions can be misinterpreted. The correct approach might involve more formal channels to ensure there's no issue. So, while the teacher's intention wasn't wrong, the method might have been a misstep. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not, but he should have handled it differently. The answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong, but should consider better methods next time.\n"
