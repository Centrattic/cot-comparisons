I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear multiple times. He tried different ways to address it without calling her out directly and eventually passed a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The student is repeatedly showing her underwear. As a teacher, he's in a position of authority and has a responsibility to maintain professionalism. He tried to handle it discreetly because he was concerned about how to approach it without making her uncomfortable or causing a scene. The key here is whether his action was appropriate.\n\nHe chose to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" This is a direct but private way to address the issue. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, which suggests she understood the message. However, the aftermath led to negative reactions from the student and her friends, making the teacher feel like he's being perceived as a creep.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and professional standards for teachers. The teacher's intention was to correct a situation where a student was unknowingly showing her underwear. The method he used was non-confrontational and kept the situation private. There's no indication of harassment; he wasn't making any inappropriate comments beyond pointing out the underwear. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the intention was good, the message could be misinterpreted. The note's content is straightforward, but the power dynamic is significant. A teacher communicating with a student about their personal attire could be seen as overstepping, especially if the student feels embarrassed. The teacher might have better handled it by addressing it in a more formal setting, perhaps during a private meeting, to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nBut wait, the teacher did consider other methods like email or holding her after class, but worried about the implications. The note was a middle ground. The fact that he didn't report it to administration or make a big deal out of it shows he tried to keep it respectful. The student's reaction suggests she understood the note wasn't a harassment but a correction.\n\nOn the other hand, the negative reactions from the student and her friends indicate that the approach might not have been the best. Maybe the note came across as intrusive or made her feel embarrassed. The teacher's concern about his career and relationships with students is valid because perception is important in such roles. However, the act of pointing out the underwear itself isn't inherently wrong if done with the right intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's action was an attempt to correct a situation where the student was unknowingly immodest. The method was discreet, and there's no evidence he acted with malice. While the outcome led to tension, the initial action wasn't malicious. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014he's not in the wrong.\n"
