I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher. A female student keeps wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. The teacher feels uncomfortable and decides to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacts negatively, and her friends give the teacher dirty looks. Now the teacher is worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intention was to address a situation that made him uncomfortable, but the way he handled it might be problematic. The student might feel singled out or embarrassed. However, the teacher tried to handle it discreetly without public confrontation, which could be seen as considerate.\n\nBut in a school setting, especially with students, there are boundaries and professional standards. Teachers are expected to maintain appropriate interactions. The issue here is whether the teacher overstepped by addressing a student's clothing choice in a private note. While the teacher's intent was to point out an unintentional display, the method might be seen as inappropriate or creating a potential for misuse of authority. \n\nAlso, the student's reaction and the friends' responses suggest that the note might have been perceived as inappropriate or an invasion of privacy. Teachers should avoid situations where their actions could be misinterpreted, even if their intentions are good. There are protocols for handling such issues, like contacting the student's parents or using school policies, which the teacher didn't follow. \n\nHowever, the teacher didn't report it to administration, which might be a concern. But he tried to handle it privately to avoid public embarrassment, which is a common approach. Yet, the note could still be seen as crossing a line, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. \n\nIn some cases, teachers are trained to handle such situations, but the method used here might not be standard. The key here is the perception and potential for the situation to be misunderstood. Even if the teacher's intention was innocent, the act of commenting on a student's underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the method.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher might be in the wrong because the action could be perceived as crossing professional boundaries, even if the intent was benign. The correct approach might involve school administration or other formal channels rather than a direct, private note.\n"
