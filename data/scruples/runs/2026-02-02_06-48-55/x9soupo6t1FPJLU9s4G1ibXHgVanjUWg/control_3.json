I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by having her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it\u2014passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention here seems to be to address the student's behavior. The student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher found this uncomfortable but tried to handle it discreetly. He considered various methods but chose a note. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the teacher in a position of authority over a student, which could make this situation problematic? The student is a minor, and there's a power dynamic here. Even if the teacher's intent was to correct the student's attire, the way he approached it could be seen as inappropriate, especially with the potential for misinterpretation. \n\nAnother angle is the student's perspective. If she was unaware of her underwear being visible, the teacher's note was a direct way to inform her. However, the method of communication (a note during class) and the content (\"your underwear is showing\") might be seen as intrusive or unprofessional. The teacher's concern about being perceived as a \"creep\" is valid because of the inherent power imbalance and the potential for the situation to escalate. \n\nAlso, the fact that the student and her friends reacted negatively suggests that the teacher's approach might not have been the best. Perhaps a more appropriate method would have been to address it privately after class in a professional manner, ensuring that it doesn't come off as a personal comment. Alternatively, setting clear classroom rules about dress code and behavior could prevent such issues without singling out a student.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical guidelines, many institutions have strict policies about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. A note about underwear might cross a boundary, even if well-intentioned. The teacher's worry about a rumor affecting his career is a red flag indicating possible professional misconduct.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, were not the most appropriate given the power dynamics and the potential for misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the teacher is in the wrong). However, another perspective might argue that the teacher was trying to correct a student's attire in a respectful way. But given the context of a teacher-student relationship, the method used is questionable. So the answer is A.\n"
