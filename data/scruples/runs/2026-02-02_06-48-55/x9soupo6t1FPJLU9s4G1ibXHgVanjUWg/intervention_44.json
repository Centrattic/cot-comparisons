I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by sitting with her feet up while wearing skirts. He tried different methods to address it without making her feel embarrassed, like passing a note. But now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main points to consider are the appropriateness of his actions and the potential for misinterpretation. The teacher's intention was to address the student's unintentional exposure. He tried to handle it discreetly without involving others or causing her embarrassment. However, there's a risk in a teacher-student relationship, especially when it's a man and a woman, that any communication about personal attire could be misinterpreted. \n\nThe student might have felt humiliated by the note, even if the teacher's intent was to help. The problem is that the teacher's action, while well-meaning, might have crossed a boundary. Educators are expected to maintain professional boundaries, and direct comments about a student's clothing could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Additionally, the teacher's concern about rumors and career impact suggests he's aware of potential risks. \n\nOn the other hand, the student's repeated behavior could be unintentional, but the teacher had a responsibility to address it in a professional manner. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the student in a private, non-confrontational setting, perhaps mentioning the behavior without focusing on the underwear, like suggesting a different seating posture. Also, consulting with a colleague or administrator to handle it more formally might have been a safer route.\n\nThe key issue here is the appropriateness of the teacher's response. Even if the intent was good, the method might not align with professional standards. In many schools, there are strict policies about teacher-student interactions, especially regarding personal appearance. The teacher's action, though private, could still be perceived as inappropriate, leading to the student's and friends' negative reaction. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for not following the proper protocol or for not maintaining a professional distance in his approach.\n"
