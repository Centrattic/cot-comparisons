I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet on the desk. He tried to handle it in different ways\u2014ignoring it, considering talking to her after class or emailing her\u2014but eventually passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, leading him to question if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student without making it a big deal. He wanted to avoid calling her out in front of others, which is a valid concern. The note seems like a private and direct way to handle it. However, some might argue that it's inappropriate for a teacher to be focused on a student's underwear at all, regardless of intentions. There's a power dynamic here, and even if the teacher's action was meant to be helpful, it could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. On the other hand, the student's repeated behavior suggests she might not be aware of what's happening, so the teacher's intervention could be seen as necessary. The key points are whether the teacher acted in good faith and if his method was appropriate. The note was direct and not confrontational, and since there's no mention of any formal complaint or school policy violation, maybe it's not his fault. But in a school setting, any interaction involving a student's personal attire could be sensitive. The answer might depend on cultural or institutional norms. However, given the context, the teacher's action seems to be a reasonable attempt to address an issue he observed, especially if the student wasn't aware. So, the answer might be B (No), but some might argue A (Yes) due to the inherent sensitivity of the situation. But since the note was a simple, non-harassment message, probably B is correct.\n"
