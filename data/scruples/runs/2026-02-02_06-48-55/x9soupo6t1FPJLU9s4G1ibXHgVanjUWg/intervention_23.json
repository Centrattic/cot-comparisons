I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly flashing her underwear by putting her feet up while wearing skirts. He tried different ways to address it\u2014eventually passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now he's worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student about her clothing being visible. But how he went about it might be the issue. Passing a note in a public setting, even if discreet, can be awkward and potentially embarrassing for the student. It's possible that the student felt humiliated or that the teacher was overstepping. Even if the teacher meant well, the method could be problematic. \n\nIn a school environment, interactions between teachers and students need to be professional and considerate. The teacher might have a valid concern, but the approach could be seen as inappropriate. Instead of a note, maybe a private, non-confrontational conversation after class would be better. However, the teacher was concerned about being accused of misconduct if he approached her in person. \n\nAnother angle: the student's behavior might be habitual, but it's also possible she wasn't aware. The teacher's note was direct but perhaps too blunt. The subsequent reactions from the student and her friends suggest that the note caused more harm in terms of relationships. \n\nThere's also the aspect of power dynamics. Teachers hold authority, and even a simple note can be perceived as a form of harassment, especially if the student feels targeted. The teacher's concern about rumors spreading is valid because any perceived misconduct can damage a teacher's career. \n\nHowever, the teacher did address the issue without involving superiors, which might have been a more formal route. But he also didn't escalate it unnecessarily, which could be seen as responsible. \n\nSo, was the teacher in the wrong? The note was a direct but potentially awkward solution. The teacher's intention was to correct a situation where a student might be unaware, but the method might have been unprofessional. There's a middle ground here. The teacher could have handled it more discreetly and respectfully. Considering all factors, the answer might be A (Yes), he's in the wrong because the approach was unprofessional and could be seen as inappropriate given the context and power dynamics.\n"
