I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The teacher noticed a female student wearing skirts and having her feet up, showing her underwear. He tried to handle it with a note, but the students now think he's a creep.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention seems good. He wanted to let the student know without making her feel embarrassed in front of others. Using a note is a common way to privately inform someone without public shaming. But maybe the method was inappropriate? Like, sending a note about underwear could be misinterpreted, especially in a teacher-student context. The student might have felt humiliated or thought the teacher was being intrusive. Also, the fact that the student and her friends gave him dirty looks suggests that his approach didn't land well. \n\nBut wait, the student was showing her underwear repeatedly. The teacher had a duty to address it, right? He might have been trying to be respectful. However, in some cases, teachers are advised not to make personal comments to students of the opposite sex, especially about clothing, to avoid any misunderstanding. Maybe he should have handled it through the school's proper channels, like talking to the student in a professional setting or involving a female colleague to discuss it. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher is male, and the student is female. Even if the note was meant to be helpful, it could be seen as an invasion of privacy or inappropriate communication. Schools often have strict policies about communication between teachers and students to prevent any issues. The teacher might not have followed the correct procedure, which could have been a mistake. \n\nAlso, considering the potential for rumors and the impact on his career, maybe he should have been more cautious. The email idea was bad because of the age difference and the nature of the message. Holding her after class could be better if done discreetly, but he was worried about embarrassing her. \n\nIn some schools, there are guidelines about how to handle such situations. For example, using a generic message for all students who show their underwear, rather than individual notes. Or addressing it in class without singling anyone out. \n\nSo, the teacher's actions were well-intentioned, but the method might have been unprofessional. He should have used a more formal or neutral approach to avoid any perception of impropriety. Therefore, the answer might be A (the teacher is in the wrong) because he didn't follow appropriate procedures, even if his intention was good.\n"
