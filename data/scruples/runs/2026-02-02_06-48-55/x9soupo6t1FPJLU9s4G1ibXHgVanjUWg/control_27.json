I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The teacher is male, the student is female. The situation involves the student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. The teacher tried different ways to address it and finally passed a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher's intention was to inform the student without causing her embarrassment. He mentions that he tried various methods but was concerned about how to approach it. The note was direct but brief. The problem is that the student and her friends now give him dirty looks, making him worry about rumors.\n\nNow, from a professional standpoint, teachers need to maintain appropriate boundaries. However, the situation here seems to be about a student's clothing choice, which is a common issue in schools. The teacher's response was to inform the student privately. The note was straightforward and professional, not personal or inappropriate.\n\nBut there's a potential issue with the method. Even though the note was meant to be a quick fix, some might argue that a teacher discussing a student's clothing, especially in a way that could be perceived as intrusive, might be seen as inappropriate. However, the teacher's intent was to correct a situation where the student might not be aware of her exposure. Schools often have dress codes, and teachers are sometimes expected to address such issues.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher could have approached the student after class or during a break to discuss it more formally. However, the note method was an attempt to keep it discreet. The student's reaction was defensive, which might have been due to embarrassment or misunderstanding, not necessarily the teacher's fault.\n\nLegally and ethically, unless the teacher made a comment for inappropriate reasons (like harassment), the action seems justified. The key is the teacher's intention. Since he was trying to inform her to prevent her from being embarrassed, it's a reasonable action. The problem arises if the note was seen as a form of harassment or if there were repeated, unnecessary comments. But here, it's a single, discreet note.\n\nHowever, some might argue that a 30-year-old teacher communicating with a student about underwear could be misinterpreted, especially if the student is a minor. Even if the note was appropriate, the perception matters. The student and her friends' reactions suggest discomfort, which could lead to rumors. The teacher might need to address this by clarifying his intentions with the student or her friends, but the initial action might not be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for debate about the best approach, the teacher's intent was to help the student, not to harass her. The method might have been a bit hasty, but the underlying action was based on concern for the student's dignity. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note that handling it more formally might have been better.\n"
