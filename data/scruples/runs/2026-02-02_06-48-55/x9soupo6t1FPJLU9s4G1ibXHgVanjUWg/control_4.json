I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher did the wrong thing here. So, the teacher is a male high school teacher. He noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to show. He found it uncomfortable and tried to ignore it. Then the student kept doing it with different outfits, like shorts or jeans, but still put her feet up. The teacher thought she didn't realize it, so he decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" She reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intention was to address a situation that made him uncomfortable without making the student feel embarrassed or singled out. He tried to handle it discreetly, which makes sense because calling out a student in front of others could be awkward. However, in a professional setting like a school, especially involving a teacher and student, even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. \n\nThe key points here are the power dynamic between a teacher and student, the appropriateness of the communication method, and whether the teacher overstepped. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain professional boundaries. While the teacher's action was meant to address his discomfort, the note about underwear could be seen as invading the student's privacy or focusing on her body in a way that's inappropriate given their roles.\n\nAlso, the student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks suggest that the message was received as offensive or inappropriate. Even if the teacher had good intentions, the message itself could be misinterpreted, especially in the context of a teacher-student relationship. It's possible that the student felt humiliated or that the teacher was prying into her personal choices, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the school's policies on teacher-student interactions. Teachers should avoid any communication that could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Even a note might not be the best approach here. A better method might have been to discuss it privately without focusing on her clothing, perhaps addressing the behavior (like feet on the desk) rather than the consequence (underwear showing). That way, the teacher maintains professionalism without commenting on her attire specifically.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher might be in the wrong because the way he addressed the issue could be seen as crossing professional boundaries, even if he didn't have malicious intent. The method of communication (a note about underwear) is likely inappropriate in this context.\n"
