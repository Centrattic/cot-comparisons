I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a female student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher noticed this a few times and eventually passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but then she and her friends started giving the teacher dirty looks, leading to potential issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the teacher's actions. The teacher is male, and the student is female. The teacher noticed the student's clothing choice and decided to address it by passing a note. The key points here are: the student's behavior, the teacher's response, and the possible implications.\n\nThe student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which inadvertently showed her underwear. From the teacher's perspective, it might have been uncomfortable to see this, but the teacher chose a private way to address it. However, the method of communication\u2014a note saying \"your underwear is showing\"\u2014could be problematic. Even if the teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassment, the note's content might be misinterpreted, especially in a high school setting where any form of communication between a teacher and a student can be scrutinized.\n\nAnother angle is the gender dynamics here. A male teacher addressing a female student about her clothing might raise questions about the appropriateness of the interaction, regardless of intent. The student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends suggest that the message might have been received as inappropriate or offensive. The teacher's concern about rumors spreading is valid because in such environments, even innocent actions can be misconstrued, leading to serious consequences for the teacher's career.\n\nAlso, considering the teacher's options: emailing, holding her after class, or talking to a colleague for advice. The note was a direct approach, but perhaps the teacher should have involved a colleague or the school administration to handle it more formally. Alternatively, maybe the teacher should have considered if there's a different way to address the issue without direct confrontation, like giving a general reminder about appropriate clothing in front of the class.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that the student doesn't know her underwear is showing. The teacher might have overstepped by making that assumption. It's possible the student was aware and chose to ignore it, but the teacher's response was to point it out in a private note. However, the teacher's intention was to help the student avoid embarrassment, which is understandable.\n\nBut from a professional standpoint, the teacher's actions could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate. The act of writing a note about a student's clothing and underwear might cross a boundary, especially given the power dynamic between teacher and student. Even if the intent was good, the method might not be appropriate. Schools often have policies about how to handle such situations, which might involve reporting to administration rather than handling it one-on-one.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher intended to address the issue privately and respectfully, the method chosen could be seen as crossing a professional boundary. The potential for misinterpretation and the resulting consequences for the teacher's career suggest that the teacher might be in the wrong, regardless of the original intent.\n"
