I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for passing a note to a student about her underwear showing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is male, and the student is a female upperclassman. The student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried different ways to address it without making it awkward, eventually choosing a note. The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the teacher overstepped. The teacher's intention was to inform the student discreetly. But the student might perceive it as an invasion of privacy or inappropriate. Teachers are supposed to maintain professional boundaries. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the act of commenting on a student's clothing, especially privately, can be seen as unprofessional. There's a risk of it being misinterpreted, especially in the context of power dynamics between teacher and student.\n\nAlso, the student might not have realized her underwear was showing, so the teacher's action could be seen as necessary. However, the method of communication\u2014passing a note\u2014might not be the best approach. Maybe a more formal but discreet way, like a brief, respectful conversation, would have been better. But in this case, the teacher tried to be considerate and avoid public embarrassment, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher is in a position of authority. Any personal communication, especially about clothing, could lead to misunderstandings. The student's reaction and the friends' response suggest that the message didn't come across as the teacher intended. The teacher is worried about rumors and potential career impact, which is valid. Schools often have policies about communication with students; perhaps the teacher should have followed official channels, like speaking with the student in a professional setting or consulting with an administrator first.\n\nBut considering the scenario, the teacher acted with good intentions and tried to be discreet. The student didn't know, so the teacher's intervention was to help her. However, the method of passing a note might be problematic. The key here is whether the action was appropriate. In some schools, even well-intentioned actions can lead to issues due to the potential for misinterpretation. The teacher's concern about being seen as a creep is valid because of the inherent power imbalance.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the teacher isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the approach could have been better. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how the situation was handled. The teacher's intention was to help, but the method might not be the best. However, the act itself isn't malicious. The main takeaway is that the teacher tried to address it discreetly, which is commendable, but perhaps should consider more formal methods in the future to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n"
