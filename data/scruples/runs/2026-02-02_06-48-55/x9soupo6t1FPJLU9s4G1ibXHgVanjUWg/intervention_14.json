I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is that a male teacher noticed a female student was showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which made her put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the perspective of the teacher. He felt uncomfortable and tried to address it in what he thought was a discreet way by passing a note. He didn't want to embarrass her or draw attention, so he went with the note. But the student and her friends now think he's a creep. Why?\n\nFrom the student's side, a male teacher pointing out a female student's underwear, no matter how well-intentioned, can be seen as invasive or even predatory. It's a sensitive situation because of the power dynamic. Even if the teacher's intention was to help, the message itself is about her private undergarments. This could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting where such interactions need to be very professional.\n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014passing a note during class\u2014might not be the best approach. It's not a standard way to address a student's clothing choice. Normally, a teacher might address the behavior (like feet on the desk) without referencing the underwear. By focusing on the underwear, it could come across as inappropriate.\n\nThe teacher is worried about rumors and his career, which is valid. Even if he's not in trouble with the school, the perception is key. Students and their parents might not understand the context, and a situation like this can lead to accusations, which can be hard to defend against.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to address something that was making him uncomfortable and that he believed the student wasn't aware of. But the method was problematic. The right approach would be to address the behavior (feet on the desk) without referencing the underwear. Maybe a note about the feet, not the undergarments. That way, it's professional and avoids the potential for misconduct perceptions.\n\nSo, the teacher's intention was to correct the behavior, but the way he did it was inconsiderate of the power dynamics and the sensitivity of the message. Therefore, he's in the wrong because the method was inappropriate, even if the intention was to help.\n"
