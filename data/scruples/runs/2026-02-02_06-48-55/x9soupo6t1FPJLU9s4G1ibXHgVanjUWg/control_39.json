I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is at fault for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation involves a male teacher and a female student. The student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried a few methods to address it, like handing her a note.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about appropriate interactions between a teacher and a student. Teachers are in a position of authority, so any personal or potentially sensitive communication needs to be handled carefully. Passing a note about underwear might be seen as a private matter, but it's also a situation where the teacher is pointing out something that could be considered a breach of dress code. However, the way it was approached might be problematic. \n\nThe student and her friends now give the teacher dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. This suggests that the communication method might have been inappropriate. Even if the teacher's intention was to correct her, the note could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting. There's also the issue of the power dynamic; a teacher addressing a student's undergarments in a direct, written note, even if well-intentioned, might not be the best approach. \n\nI should consider school policies. Teachers are usually expected to handle such issues discreetly but professionally. Maybe the teacher should have spoken to the student privately after class instead of using a note. Email or a verbal conversation in a public setting might be better to avoid any misunderstanding. Also, if the student was repeatedly flashing her underwear without realizing it, it's possible the teacher should have addressed it in a way that's more in line with official channels, like speaking to the student in a non-confrontational manner during a break or involving the school administration if necessary.\n\nBut wait, the teacher's main concern was the student's awareness and the potential for a rumor. The note was meant to be private, but maybe it's still not the right method. There's a risk of it being perceived as a personal comment rather than a professional correction. In some cases, even if done discreetly, such notes could lead to accusations of harassment. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher wasn't reported, so maybe the action was seen as acceptable by the school. However, the reaction from the student and her peers indicates that there's a perception problem. The teacher might need to reflect on how to handle such situations in the future, perhaps using more standard protocols. \n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The action was intended to correct a breach in dress code, but the method used could be improved. The answer might be that the teacher is not in the wrong (B) because he was trying to address a valid issue, but the approach was not the best. However, others might argue that the method was inappropriate regardless of intention. I need to decide based on common professional standards. Usually, teachers are advised to avoid personal or potentially suggestive notes to students. Instead, they should use verbal communication in a professional setting or through appropriate channels. So the teacher might be at fault for the method, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the answer could be A. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check if there's a standard on this. In many schools, direct written notes about clothing might be against policy. The teacher should probably have spoken to the student in person during a suitable time, maybe in a public area after class, to avoid any private interaction that could be misconstrued. Therefore, the answer is A. The teacher is in the wrong for handling it that way.\n"
