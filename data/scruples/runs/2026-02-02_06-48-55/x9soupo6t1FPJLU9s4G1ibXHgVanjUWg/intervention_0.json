I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to show. He tried to address it by passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the teacher's actions. The main issue here is the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the method of addressing the issue might be problematic. Teachers are in a position of authority, and any direct communication about a student's clothing, especially something as personal as underwear, can be seen as inappropriate or intrusive.\n\nThe teacher tried to handle it privately with a note, which might seem like a good idea to avoid public embarrassment. However, the act of pointing out the underwear showing could be perceived as the teacher being overly focused on the student's appearance, which could lead to accusations of harassment. Even if the student didn't react negatively at the moment, the fact that her friends now view the teacher negatively suggests that the approach might have been misunderstood or mishandled.\n\nAnother angle is the teacher's responsibility to create a safe learning environment. If the student's attire was causing her to be uncomfortable or distracted, the teacher should address it in a way that maintains professionalism. However, the teacher's direct communication might have crossed a boundary. It's possible that the student didn't realize she was showing, but by pointing it out, the teacher could be seen as objectifying her or focusing on her body, which is inappropriate in an educational setting.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher's concern about rumors and his career indicates that he's aware of potential issues. The fact that there's no mention of administrative involvement might mean that the school hasn't addressed the situation, but that doesn't necessarily mean the teacher is in the right. The students' reactions suggest that the approach was not well-received, which could affect the classroom dynamic and his credibility.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, the teacher might have considered a more indirect method, such as speaking with the student about appropriate classroom behavior without focusing on the clothing. Alternatively, he could have addressed the behavior (like feet on the desk) rather than the clothing itself. This way, he avoids commenting on the student's body and maintains professional boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention might have been to help the student, the method of addressing the issue was inappropriate given the power dynamics and potential for misinterpretation. The direct comment about underwear is likely to be seen as crossing a professional boundary, making the teacher the one at fault.\n"
