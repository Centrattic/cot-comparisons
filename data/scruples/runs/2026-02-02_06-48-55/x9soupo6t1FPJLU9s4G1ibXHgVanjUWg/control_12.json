I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried multiple times to address it without calling her out directly. Finally, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the teacher acted inappropriately. The key points here are the power dynamics between a teacher and student, the method of communication, and the intent behind the action. The teacher was trying to correct a situation where the student might be unaware of her attire. However, teachers have a responsibility to maintain professional boundaries. Even though the teacher's intention was to inform the student, the act of commenting on a student's clothing, especially in a personal manner, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe note itself is direct and personal. While it's a straightforward message, the content is about the student's undergarments, which is a very personal topic. Given that there's a significant age and authority gap, any communication about such a personal thing could be misinterpreted. The student's reaction of scoffing suggests she wasn't aware, but the friends now giving dirty looks might indicate that the note was perceived as inappropriate or invasive.\n\nAlso, considering the potential for rumors and the teacher's career being affected, this highlights the sensitivity of the situation. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the method could be seen as unprofessional. There might be alternative ways to handle it, like addressing the behavior without focusing on the underwear, such as asking her to keep feet off the desk for safety reasons, which would avoid the personal nature of the comment.\n\nIn many educational policies, maintaining professional distance is crucial. A teacher discussing a student's clothing in such a direct manner could violate those boundaries, regardless of the intent. The fact that the teacher considered emailing her but worried about how it might look shows he's aware of the potential for misunderstanding. \n\nSo, while the teacher might not have had malicious intent, the action itself could be seen as inappropriately crossing into personal territory. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong because of the inconsiderate method of communication despite the intent.\n"
