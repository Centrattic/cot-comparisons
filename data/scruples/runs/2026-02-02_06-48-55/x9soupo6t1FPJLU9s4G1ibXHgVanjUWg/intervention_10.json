I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher saw a female student wearing a skirt with her feet on the desk, causing her underwear to show. He tried ignoring it, but the behavior continued. Eventually, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends started giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to correct the student's behavior in a respectful way. He considered different methods like talking to her after class or emailing but decided a note was less intrusive. The note itself was straightforward and addressed the issue without being offensive. \n\nHowever, there's a potential problem here. The teacher is a man, and the student is a female student. Even though the note was meant to be helpful, the act of a teacher passing a note about a student's clothing, especially regarding underwear, could be misinterpreted. In some contexts, this might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intention was good. \n\nSchool policies often have strict guidelines about teacher-student interactions to prevent any appearance of impropriety. The teacher might be violating these policies by handling the matter privately instead of involving a colleague or the appropriate school authority. Additionally, if the student perceived the note as a comment on her body rather than a correction, it could lead to misunderstandings or even complaints.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to address the issue discreetly, which shows he was mindful of the student's privacy and his own professional standing. The student's reaction and the subsequent rumors might be due to the sensitive nature of the situation rather than the teacher's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nBut considering the power dynamics and the potential for misinterpretation, the teacher might have been better off addressing the issue in a more formal setting, like speaking with the student in the presence of another staff member or following the school's established procedures for such matters. By taking it upon himself, he's exposed to professional risk if the situation escalates, even if his intentions were good.\n\nSo, while the teacher's intention was to correct the student's clothing in a respectful manner, the method he chose might be questionable given the context of teacher-student boundaries. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not following proper protocols.\n"
