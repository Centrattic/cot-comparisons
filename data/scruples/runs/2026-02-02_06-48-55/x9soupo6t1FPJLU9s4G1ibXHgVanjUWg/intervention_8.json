I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a female student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher, a male, noticed this and passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriate boundaries between a teacher and a student. Teachers are in a position of authority, and their interactions with students must be professional at all times. The teacher's actions here are meant to correct the student's behavior, but the method might be problematic. \n\nPassing a note about underwear showing could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intention was to be kind. The teacher is making a personal comment about the student's appearance, which could be perceived as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic. Even if the student didn't realize she was showing her underwear, the teacher's approach might not be the best. \n\nAlternative methods could have been better, like addressing it in a private conversation after class or using a more general, non-personal approach. For example, reminding the class about appropriate attire without singling out the student. The note method might make the teacher appear to be focusing on the student's body in a way that's not professional. \n\nAlso, the fact that the student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks suggests that the action was perceived negatively. The teacher should be cautious about any action that could be misinterpreted, as even if his intention was good, the perception matters a lot in such contexts. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for the situation to escalate. If the student or her friends felt targeted or embarrassed, it could lead to more serious issues. The teacher's concern about rumors ending his career is valid because even if he's not in the wrong, perceptions can be damaging. \n\nIn educational settings, it's crucial to maintain professionalism. The teacher's method of communication might not align with professional standards. Instead of a personal note, a more formal approach would be better to avoid any appearance of impropriety. \n\nSo, considering all these points, even if the teacher's intention was to help, the method he chose could be seen as inappropriate given the relationship dynamics. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
