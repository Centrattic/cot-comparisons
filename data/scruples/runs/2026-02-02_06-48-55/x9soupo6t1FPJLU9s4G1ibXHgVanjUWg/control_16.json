I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a male teacher noticed a female student was showing her underwear because she was sitting with her feet up on the desk, wearing skirts. He tried different ways to address it, finally giving her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. The question is whether the teacher did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intent was to inform the student politely without causing embarrassment. He considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing but worried about how it might be perceived. The note seems like a direct but discreet way to address it. However, from the student's perspective, receiving a note from a male teacher about her underwear could be seen as inappropriate or even a harassment risk, regardless of the teacher's intentions. \n\nEven if the teacher's actions were meant to be helpful, the method might have been unprofessional. In many schools, direct communication about such personal matters, even in a note, could be problematic. There's a power dynamic here where the teacher is in a position of authority, and the student might feel uncomfortable or targeted. The student's reaction and the subsequent rumors suggest that the note was not well-received and might have led to mistrust. \n\nThe teacher could have handled it differently, such as addressing the desk-sitting behavior without mentioning the underwear. For example, reminding her to keep feet off the desk for safety or classroom conduct reasons. That way, the comment about underwear is avoided, which could prevent any misinterpretation. \n\nSchool policies often require teachers to maintain professional boundaries. Sending a note about a student's clothing or body could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's perceived as invasive. Even if the teacher is not in trouble from superiors, the potential for the situation to escalate is there. \n\nSo, while the intention wasn't harmful, the action might be considered inappropriate due to the nature of the message and the relationship between a teacher and student. The correct approach would be to address the behavior without focusing on the student's body, thus maintaining professionalism and avoiding any potential for misunderstanding.\n"
