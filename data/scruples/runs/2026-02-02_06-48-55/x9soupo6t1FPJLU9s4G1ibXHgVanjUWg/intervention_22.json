I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The scenario is that the student was wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which showed her underwear. The teacher wrote a note, and the student and her friends started giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. He says he tried to handle it discreetly to avoid embarrassing the student. He used a note, which is a common way to address such issues without public shaming. But the student and her friends took it as him being a creep. \n\nNow, from a professional standpoint, the teacher is a male high school teacher. There's always sensitivity about interactions between teachers and students, especially of the opposite gender. The key points here are consent and appropriate communication. The teacher didn't make any inappropriate advances or comments beyond the note. The note itself was a straightforward message about her underwear showing. \n\nHowever, the method of communication might have been problematic. Handing a note in front of others, even if done subtly, could be seen as public, which might not be the best approach. Maybe a better way would be to talk to her privately after class or during office hours. But the teacher was concerned about holding her back in front of friends or sending an email that might look odd. \n\nAnother angle is whether the student is at fault. She was showing her underwear, which is against school dress codes in most places. The teacher is correcting her, which is part of his responsibility. But in a professional setting, teachers are also expected to maintain boundaries and avoid any situation that could be misconstrued as inappropriate.\n\nThe fact that the student and her friends now view him as a creep is a problem. Maybe the note came across as a prank or a joke, or the student was just being defiant. The teacher's actions were meant to correct a dress code violation, but the way it was handled might have led to misunderstanding. \n\nAlso, school policies might have guidelines on how to address such situations. If the teacher followed the school's protocol, he might be in the right. But if he didn't, there could be issues. The user mentions that there's been no action from superiors, which suggests that maybe the school doesn't see it as a problem. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, teachers are expected to address dress code issues professionally. However, the method of communication here could be questioned. Passing a note in front of others might not be the best approach. A better approach would be to speak to the student one-on-one after class, ensuring privacy to avoid any public embarrassment and to clarify that it's a dress code issue.\n\nBut the teacher's note was concise and direct, without any inappropriate language. The student's reaction might have been influenced by her own perception or the influence of her peers. The teacher didn't make a sexual comment; he just pointed out the underwear was showing. \n\nConsidering all this, the teacher's intentions were to correct a dress code violation, which is his responsibility. The method might not have been ideal, but he did try to handle it discreetly. However, in a position of authority, any communication between a teacher and a student that involves personal messages can be problematic. The fact that it's a male teacher and a female student might exacerbate perceptions, even if the teacher's actions were appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention was appropriate, the method of communication might have been unwise. However, he wasn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), as he was addressing a dress code issue, but the execution could be improved.\n"
