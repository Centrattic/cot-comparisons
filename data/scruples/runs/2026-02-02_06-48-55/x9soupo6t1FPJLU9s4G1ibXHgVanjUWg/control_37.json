I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe teacher is a male high school teacher. A female student was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to be visible. He felt uncomfortable but ignored it at first. The student repeated this behavior with different clothing and the same action. The teacher decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student scoffed and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me consider the teacher's actions. He noticed a student's clothing choice and behavior that inadvertently exposed her underwear. He tried to address it discreetly by passing a note. The note was direct but not inappropriate in content. However, the student and her friends now perceive him negatively. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries with students. The teacher's intention was to correct a wardrobe malfunction without making the student feel embarrassed. However, the method might have been misinterpreted. Even though the note was about the underwear, the act of passing a note from a teacher to a student about such a personal matter could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in a school setting where power dynamics are at play. \n\nBut the teacher's action was to inform the student of something she might not be aware of. If the student was indeed unaware, then the teacher's intention was to help. However, the student's reaction was scoffing, which might suggest she was aware and perhaps found the note intrusive. The subsequent dirty looks and rumors indicate that the student and her peers felt targeted, which could damage the teacher's reputation. \n\nAlternatively, the teacher might have considered other methods, like addressing it in front of the class with a general comment about desk feet, but that might not be specific enough. Emailing or speaking privately could be options, but the teacher was concerned about how it might look. \n\nFrom a legal and policy perspective, unless the school has specific guidelines against such a situation, the teacher might not be in the wrong. However, the perception is important. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the student's and peers' perception of him as a creep could lead to issues. \n\nAnother angle: the student's behavior (putting feet up) might be the root cause. If the teacher's action was to correct her without malice, then he's not in the wrong. But the method's appropriateness is debatable. \n\nIn some cases, teachers might avoid such direct notes to prevent any possible misinterpretation. Instead, a more indirect approach, like a general reminder about dress code or desk behavior, might be better. But the teacher's note was specific and direct, which might have been necessary if the student was unaware. \n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intention was to help, but the method could be seen as overstepping. However, without any indication of harassment or inappropriate intent, the teacher might not be in the wrong. The student's reaction complicates things, but the teacher's actions were meant to correct a situation he found uncomfortable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could have been improved. However, based on the options given, the decision is between A and B. Considering that the teacher acted in good faith and without malice, and there's no evidence of wrongdoing beyond the perception issue, I think the answer is B.\n"
