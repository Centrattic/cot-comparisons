I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is that a male teacher noticed a student showing her underwear multiple times when she put her feet on the desk. He passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which led to her and her friends giving him dirty looks afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female, and the interaction is in a high school setting. The teacher observed the issue multiple times and tried different ways to address it. He passed a note during class, which is a direct but discreet method. The student reacted by putting her feet down, but the fallout was that she and her friends are now giving him dirty looks, and there's a fear of rumors spreading.\n\nNow, thinking about professional boundaries. As a teacher, he has a responsibility to maintain appropriate behavior and address issues without overstepping. The student's actions could be unintentional, so the teacher's intent was to correct her. However, the note might come across as inappropriate or intrusive, especially given the gender dynamics and the content of the message. \n\nThere's a potential for the note to be seen as a breach of privacy or even harassment, depending on how it's perceived. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the method might not be the best approach. The student might feel embarrassed, and that could lead to resentment or accusations. The teacher's concern about being labeled a creep is valid because of the power dynamic in the teacher-student relationship.\n\nAlternative approaches could have been better. Maybe addressing it in a more formal setting, like after class, or involving a female staff member to handle it. The teacher might have considered discussing it with the student in a non-confrontational way, perhaps by having a private conversation about appropriate classroom behavior, which would include the issue without focusing on the underwear directly.\n\nThe key here is whether the teacher's method was appropriate. While the intention was to correct the student's behavior, the method might not align with professional standards. There's a risk that the note could be misinterpreted, especially in the wrong hands, leading to potential issues for the teacher. The fact that the student and her friends now see him as a creep suggests that the approach caused more harm than good in terms of professional relationships.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher might be in the wrong because the method used to address the issue, while well-intentioned, could be seen as crossing professional boundaries. The correct answer would be A.\n"
