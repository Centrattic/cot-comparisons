I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student about her underwear showing.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The teacher is male, the student is female. She was wearing a skirt and had her feet up, causing her underwear to show. The teacher noticed multiple times and eventually passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks.\n\nSo, the teacher's intention was to let the student know without making her feel embarrassed. He tried different methods but went with a note. But the student took it as a creep move. Now, is the teacher at fault here?\n\nI need to consider boundaries between teacher and student. In many places, there are strict policies about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. Sending a note about underwear might be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the nature of the message could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the student might have felt targeted or that the teacher was overstepping. Even if the teacher didn't have ill intentions, the act of pointing out her underwear in public (even via a note) might be seen as violating her privacy. There's also the age and gender dynamic here\u2014being a 30-year-old male teacher and a student, any personal communication could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe teacher could have handled it differently. Maybe addressing the behavior (like feet on the desk) instead of the underwear. Or speaking to her in a more formal setting, perhaps in front of others to avoid a one-on-one situation that might be misinterpreted. Emailing the parent or administrator might be another route, but he didn't consider that.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the method used was appropriate. The note was direct and personal, which might not align with school policies. Even if no one from the administration has said anything, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right approach. The fact that it led to rumors and strained relationships suggests that the teacher's method was flawed.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite good intentions, the method of communication was inappropriate given the teacher-student relationship and the potential for misinterpretation.\n"
