I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to let her know without being too obvious. He passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which made the student and her friends upset. Now he's worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intention was to politely inform the student without embarrassing her publicly. He went to some lengths to avoid direct confrontation, like using a note. But the student and her friends took it as creepy. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the student was the one who was showing her underwear, which is a clothing issue. The teacher's job is to maintain a respectful environment. However, the way he handled it might have been problematic. Passing a note about someone's underwear could be seen as inappropriate, even if the intention was good. There might be school policies about such interactions. Maybe the teacher should have spoken to her privately after class in a professional manner. Also, the fact that the student's friends are giving him dirty looks suggests that the message might have been taken the wrong way, or the method was not professional enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the student might not have been aware she was showing her underwear, so the teacher had a duty to inform her. But doing it via a note, which could be seen as a personal message, might cross a boundary. There's a risk of misinterpretation, especially in a teacher-student relationship where boundaries are crucial. The teacher might be in the wrong if the method of communication was inappropriate, even if the intent was correct. \n\nBut I also have to consider the student's behavior. If she was repeatedly showing her underwear without realizing it, the teacher had a responsibility to address it. However, the approach taken could be seen as overstepping. Maybe a better approach would be to have a private, discreet conversation after class rather than using a note. That way, the teacher could explain the situation professionally without it being a written message that could be misinterpreted. \n\nSo, the teacher's intent was to correct a situation where the student might be unaware, but the method used might have been unprofessional. Depending on school policies and the perception by others, the teacher could be in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (the teacher is in the wrong) because of the method used, even though the intent was not malicious. However, some might argue that the student's behavior initiated the issue. But the core issue is how the teacher communicated the message, which could be seen as crossing a boundary, hence A.\n"
