I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher did the right thing. The teacher noticed a female student showing her underwear by having her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it\u2014note, email, holding her back. Finally, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing to consider is the appropriateness of the action. As a teacher, he's in a position of authority and needs to maintain professional boundaries. The student is a minor, so any direct interaction about personal matters could be problematic. Even though his intent was to correct her, the method might be seen as inappropriate.\n\nThe teacher's options: passing a note in front of others? That could be awkward and might lead to embarrassment, which the student resented. Maybe he should have addressed it privately. But how? Holding her after class could work, but he was worried about how it would look. However, in a professional setting, it's standard to address such issues privately. Alternatively, maybe he should have spoken to the student in front of others but in a non-confrontational way. For example, \"Please keep your feet on the floor to maintain a respectful classroom environment.\" That way, it's a general reminder without singling her out or making it personal.\n\nBut the issue is that the student didn't realize she was showing. So, the teacher's intention was correct, but the method might have been inappropriate. The note could be seen as too personal and potentially suggestive, especially given the power dynamic. Even if well-meaning, it's risky in a teacher-student relationship. The fact that it caused resentment and rumors suggests that the approach was not effective and possibly unprofessional.\n\nAlso, school policies usually require reporting such incidents. If the student's actions were recurring and disruptive, perhaps the teacher should have involved the administration. But he didn't mention that, so maybe he thought it was a simple correction. However, the way he handled it might not align with school protocols, which could lead to issues later.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intent was to correct the student, the method was likely unprofessional and could be seen as crossing boundaries. The correct approach would be a private, respectful conversation, not a note about her underwear. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
