I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher wrote a note to a student saying her underwear was showing. The student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up, which caused the issue. The teacher tried different ways to address it but finally used a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, the teacher is a man, and the student is female. The situation involves the student's clothing and the teacher pointing it out. The main question is whether the teacher did something wrong.\n\nFrom the teacher's perspective, he tried to handle it without being confrontational. He didn't want to call her out in front of others, so a note seemed like a private way. But the student might have felt embarrassed or targeted. The teacher's age is mentioned as 30, which is relatively close to the upperclassmen's age, so maybe there's some perception of inappropriateness if he's seen as being too focused on a student's appearance.\n\nLegally, I don't think the teacher is in the wrong because he's addressing a situation where the student's behavior might be against dress code. However, the method of using a note could be problematic. It's possible that the student didn't realize she was showing, but the way the teacher handled it might have been seen as intrusive or inappropriate, especially if the student felt embarrassed. Also, there's the potential for a rumor mill in a high school setting, which could affect the teacher's reputation even if there's no official reprimand.\n\nEthically, the teacher's intention was to inform the student, but the approach might have been unprofessional. Instead of a note, maybe he should have spoken to her privately after class or used a more formal method. The fact that the note led to the student and her friends viewing him as a creep is a red flag. Even if the action was meant to correct a dress code violation, the way it was done might have overstepped professional boundaries, especially considering the power dynamic between a teacher and student.\n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher might be in the wrong because the method of addressing the issue was unprofessional and could lead to misunderstandings or perceptions of inappropriate behavior. The answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
