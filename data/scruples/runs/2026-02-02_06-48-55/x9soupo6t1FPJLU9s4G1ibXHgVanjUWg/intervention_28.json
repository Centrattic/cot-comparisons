I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a female student is wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, which causes her underwear to be visible. The teacher tries a few methods to address this\u2014like handing a note saying \"your underwear is showing\"\u2014but the student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his career.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student privately. He considered different methods like emailing her or talking after class but was concerned about how each approach might come off. The note was a direct but discreet attempt to address the issue without public embarrassment. However, the student reacted with scoffing, and now there's a change in the classroom dynamic.\n\nI need to consider the appropriate ways to handle such a situation. Is it reasonable for a teacher to address a student about their clothing in this manner? There's a line between professional boundaries and personal space. Teachers are supposed to maintain a certain level of professionalism and avoid any situations that could be misinterpreted. But in this case, the teacher is trying to correct a wardrobe malfunction, which is a common issue.\n\nBut then, the method he used\u2014a note saying \"your underwear is showing\"\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. Even though his intention was helpful, the message itself is about the student's undergarments, which is a sensitive topic. The student might have felt humiliated or that the teacher was prying into her personal life. Also, the fact that the student reacted with scoffing and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends suggests that the note might have been perceived as intrusive or unprofessional.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The teacher is an adult in a position of authority, and the student is a minor. Any communication between them that's personal could be problematic, especially if it's about something as private as underwear. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the method could be seen as crossing a professional boundary. If the note was given in a more formal context, like during a private conversation after class, it might be better received. But a handwritten note during class might be too casual and could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nAlso, the teacher's concern about potential rumors is valid. In a school setting, any interaction between a teacher and a student that seems out of line can be misinterpreted, especially if it's about something like underwear. The teacher's age (30) and the student's age (upperclassman, likely 16-18) are close in years, which might make the situation more delicate. If someone were to question the teacher's intent, even if he had good intentions, it could be damaging.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher's actions, while well-intentioned, might have crossed into inappropriate territory. The method of communication was too direct and private, which could lead to misinterpretation. A better approach might have been to speak to the student in a more formal setting, perhaps in private, to explain the situation without making it about her underwear. Alternatively, the teacher could have addressed it by saying something like, \"Please keep your feet on the desk,\" without mentioning the underwear. That way, the issue is handled without focusing on the undergarments, maintaining professionalism.\n\nIn summary, the teacher's intent was to help, but the method used was likely unprofessional and could be seen as overstepping. So, the answer might be that the teacher is in the wrong because of the way he handled the situation.\n"
