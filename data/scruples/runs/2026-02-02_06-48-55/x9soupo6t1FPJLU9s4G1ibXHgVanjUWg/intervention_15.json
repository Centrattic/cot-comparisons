I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school instructor who noticed a female student showing her underwear multiple times. He tried different ways to address it without embarrassing her, like passing a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student she was showing her underwear. The note was a direct but discreet method. He considered other options like holding her after class or emailing, which might have been more confrontational or inappropriate. The note seems like a reasonable approach to avoid public embarrassment.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here. When a teacher directly addresses a student about their underwear, even in a note, it could be seen as crossing a boundary. Especially in a professional setting, such a personal message might be misinterpreted. The student might feel uncomfortable or think the teacher is overly focused on her attire, leading to the negative reactions she's displaying.\n\nAlso, the fact that the student kept doing it suggests maybe she wasn't aware, but the teacher's method of correction might have come off as abrupt. Perhaps a more indirect approach, like a general reminder about appropriate dress or a non-verbal cue without specifying the underwear, might have been better to avoid personal confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it discreetly and without involving others. The school hasn't taken any action against him, which implies that maybe it's within acceptable bounds. But the key question is whether the note was an appropriate way to address the situation. Some might argue that the message is too personal and could lead to misunderstandings, while others might see it as a necessary action to prevent the student from unknowingly immodest.\n\nIn terms of professional boundaries, the teacher's actions are ambiguous. While the intent was to help, the method could be seen as intrusive. The student's reaction and the friends' dirty looks indicate that the message was received as a violation of privacy or as harassment, even if unintended. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong because the approach, though well-intentioned, could be perceived as inappropriate given the power dynamics in a teacher-student relationship.\n"
