I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher did the right thing here. The situation is that a female student was repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet up while wearing skirts. The teacher found it uncomfortable and tried to address it by passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. He wanted to inform the student politely without embarrassing her. He considered other methods like email or holding her after class but worried about how they might be perceived. The note was direct but maybe not the best approach.\n\nBut wait, is it the teacher's responsibility to address this? The student is a minor, and the situation involves a male teacher and a female student. Even if the teacher had good intentions, passing a note about underwear could be misinterpreted. Some might see it as the teacher being inappropriately focused on the student's body, regardless of intent. There's a power dynamic here; teachers are in a position of authority, so even innocent actions can be seen as problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher wasn't making a sexual advance but trying to correct the student's behavior. If the student was unaware, he had a duty to inform her. However, the method might have been inappropriate. A better approach might have been to address it in a more formal setting, like speaking to her in private during office hours, or perhaps involving a female staff member to handle it. \n\nAlso, considering the potential for rumors and the sensitive nature of teacher-student interactions, any direct communication about such a personal topic could be risky. Maybe the teacher should have addressed it indirectly, like making a general comment about dress code or desk usage, rather than a personal note. \n\nIn terms of professional standards, many schools have strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. A note about underwear could be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of intent. Even if there's no official complaint, the teacher's reputation is at risk because of how it might be perceived.\n\nSo, while the teacher's intention was not malicious, the action itself is questionable due to the inherent power imbalance and the way it could be misinterpreted. The correct answer might be that he's in the wrong because the method of communication was inappropriate, even if his intent was good.\n"
