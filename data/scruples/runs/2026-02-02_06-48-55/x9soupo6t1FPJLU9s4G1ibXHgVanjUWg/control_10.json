I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a male teacher who wrote a note to a female student because her underwear was visible. He was uncomfortable but tried to handle it discreetly. The student responded negatively, and now he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intent was to correct the student's behavior without making her feel embarrassed. He tried different methods like ignoring it first, then passing a note. But the student took offense and her friends are giving him dirty looks. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the student was the one who had her underwear showing, so pointing that out is usually considered polite. However, the way he did it might be an issue. Passing a note in class could be seen as inappropriate, especially since it's a teacher-student dynamic. There might be concerns about power dynamics here. Even if his intention was good, the method could be problematic. Schools often have strict policies about communication between teachers and students, and a note about underwear might be seen as crossing a boundary. Also, the fact that the student and her friends are now upset and giving him dirty looks suggests that the approach might have been misjudged. He should have considered other methods, like speaking to her after class in a professional manner or involving a colleague or administrator to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was trying to address a situation that's commonly handled by pointing it out discreetly. The problem might be more about perception and the context of a teacher-student relationship. The fact that he's a male teacher dealing with a female student adds another layer, as it could be seen as an invasion of privacy or inappropriate attention. \n\nIn many school policies, even well-intentioned actions can be problematic if they involve personal communication between teachers and students. The note might be seen as an overreach, and the student's reaction could lead to formal complaints. Therefore, even though the teacher's intention was to correct the student, the method he used was inappropriate. So the answer would be that the teacher is in the wrong (A).\n"
