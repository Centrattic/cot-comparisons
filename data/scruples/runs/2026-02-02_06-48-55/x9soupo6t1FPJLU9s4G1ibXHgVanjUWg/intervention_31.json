I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe teacher is male, the student is female. She was sitting in the front, wearing skirts, and putting her feet up, which inadvertently showed her underwear. The teacher initially ignored it, then tried to address it by passing a note. The student reacted negatively, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intent was to inform the student without making her uncomfortable. He considered different methods, like talking to her after class or emailing, but went with a note. The note was direct but private. The student took it as offensive, leading to her and her friends giving him dirty looks. The teacher is worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? Let's think about the context. As a teacher, his primary role is to educate and maintain a professional environment. However, making a comment about a student's clothing, even if it's about their underwear, can be seen as inappropriate. Especially in a high school setting where boundaries are crucial. The teacher's actions could be misinterpreted as harassment or a breach of professional conduct. Even if the intention was to help the student, the method might not be acceptable. Schools often have strict policies about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. A note might be seen as inconsiderate or unprofessional. The student's reaction suggests that the message might have been delivered in a way that was embarrassing. The teacher might have better addressed this by discussing it in a private, respectful manner, perhaps after class, explaining his discomfort without being explicit. The fact that the student's friends now view him negatively could indicate that the approach wasn't handled sensitively. Also, the teacher's concern about rumors and career impact shows he's aware that this situation could be problematic. So, considering all that, while the teacher's intention was to help, the method used may have crossed professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong.\n"
