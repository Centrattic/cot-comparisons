I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the teacher did something wrong by telling the student her underwear was showing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher is male, the student is female. The student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried different methods to address it without making it awkward, finally passing a note. The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks.\n\nHmm. From a professional standpoint, the teacher's intent was to correct the student's clothing situation. But the way it was handled might be the issue. Passing a note directly to a student about their underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. There's a risk of misinterpretation, and even if the teacher's intention was innocent, the method might be problematic. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of school policies. Many schools have strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students, especially around personal topics. Emailing or private notes might not be the recommended approach. The teacher might have violated those policies, even if no one has confronted them yet. \n\nAnother angle: the student's reaction. She scoffed and put her feet down, but the social repercussions followed. The student and her friends now view the teacher as a creep. This could lead to rumors, which the teacher is worried about. But the root issue is whether the teacher overstepped his role. \n\nIn most professional settings, teachers are advised to address such issues in a public, non-embarrassing way. For example, making a general announcement about clothing or desk feet policies rather than a private note. The teacher might have acted in good faith but didn't follow the best practices for maintaining appropriate boundaries.\n\nSo, even if the teacher didn't have bad intentions, the action taken could be considered unprofessional. The answer might lean towards the teacher being in the wrong because of the method used and the potential for misunderstanding. The correct approach would involve adhering to school protocols and maintaining a professional distance.\n"
