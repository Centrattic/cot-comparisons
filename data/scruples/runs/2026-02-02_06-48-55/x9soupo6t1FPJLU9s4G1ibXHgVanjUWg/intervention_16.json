I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher, a man, notices a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which causes her underwear to be visible. He initially ignores it, but after it happens multiple times, he decides to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacts negatively, and her friends now give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is a male, and the student is a female. The situation involves the student's clothing choices and her actions. The teacher's intention was to inform her without causing a scene. But the student's reaction and the subsequent rumors are a problem.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher did take a direct but non-confrontational approach. However, there's a power dynamic here because a teacher has authority over a student. Sending a note about underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially given the potential for misinterpretation. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the message could be perceived as intrusive or a privacy violation. The student might feel exposed or embarrassed, leading to the negative reactions from her friends. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher could argue that he was trying to help her maintain her dignity. But in a professional setting, especially in education, teachers need to be cautious about how they interact with students. A note about undergarments might not be the best approach. Perhaps a more formal method, like speaking with the student in private after class without other students present, might have been better. However, the teacher was concerned about embarrassing her in front of friends, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, considering that the student changed her clothing after the first time, maybe the issue wasn't about the teacher's note causing the problem but the student's reaction. However, the teacher's action of passing the note could still be seen as crossing a boundary. The teacher's age (30) and the student being an upperclassman (probably around 16-18) adds another layer, as even though the age difference isn't huge, the professional relationship is crucial.\n\nAnother angle: workplace policies and guidelines. Schools usually have strict rules about teacher-student interactions. A note about clothing could be flagged, especially if it's about personal clothing. The teacher might have violated some policy, leading to potential disciplinary action even if it hasn't happened yet. The fact that the student and her friends now view the teacher negatively is a red flag.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention was to help, the method might be inappropriate given the power dynamics and professional boundaries. The teacher should have considered alternative approaches that maintain both the student's dignity and the teacher's professionalism. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong.\n"
