I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, revealing her underwear. He tried to address it with a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a teacher and a student. The teacher is aware of the student's clothing choices and her habit of putting her feet up. By the third time, he decides to pass a note. The key issue here is the appropriateness of his action. \n\nTeachers have a responsibility to maintain professional boundaries. Any communication with students, especially about personal matters, needs to be handled carefully. The note itself is direct but maybe not overtly inappropriate. However, the method of communication could be problematic. Passing a note in front of classmates might make the student feel embarrassed, and the content is about her personal appearance, which could be seen as intrusive.\n\nAnother angle is the teacher's initial reaction. He waited until the third incident before addressing it. Maybe he could have addressed it earlier in a more private setting. Also, considering the potential for misinterpretation, especially given the power dynamics between a teacher and student, even a well-intentioned note might be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe student's reaction (scoffing and putting her feet down) suggests she was aware of the note's message. However, the fallout with her friends and the perception of being a \"creep\" indicates that the approach might have been poorly received. The teacher's concern about rumors spreading and career impact is valid because any perceived impropriety in teacher-student interactions can lead to serious consequences, even if unintended.\n\nIn many school policies, direct one-on-one communication about such personal matters should be avoided unless there's a clear, professional reason. The teacher's choice to use a note instead of a more formal, documented approach (like speaking to the student in private or consulting with a colleague first) might be seen as a misstep. \n\nAlternatively, the teacher's intention was to inform the student about her appearance without causing embarrassment, which is understandable. But the method could be questioned. Perhaps he should have spoken to her privately after class, explaining that her clothing choice might be a distraction or not appropriate in class. That way, he could address the issue without the public note and avoid misinterpretation.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intent was to correct a situation, the method he used could be seen as crossing professional boundaries. The potential for misinterpretation, especially in a hierarchical teacher-student relationship, makes his action risky. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation through more appropriate channels.\n"
