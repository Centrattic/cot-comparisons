I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the teacher did something wrong by telling the student her underwear was showing. \n\nFirst, the teacher is male, the student is female. She's wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. The teacher tried to ignore it at first, then decided to pass a note. The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher's actions, the context, and the reactions involved. The teacher's intention was to inform the student without making her uncomfortable. He considered different methods and chose a note to avoid confrontation. But the student and her friends took offense.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, as a teacher, he has a responsibility to address inappropriate student behavior, especially if it's affecting the classroom environment. The student's actions (showing underwear) could be seen as a distraction or a breach of dress code. The teacher acted in a professional manner by using a discreet note. However, there's a potential issue with a male teacher interacting with a female student about such a personal topic, even if it's just a note. But the teacher's intent was to correct the behavior, not to objectify her. \n\nBut wait, could there be a misunderstanding? The student might have felt humiliated by the note. Maybe the teacher should have spoken to her privately in person instead of a note. Or maybe he should have addressed it earlier. However, he did consider other methods and chose the least confrontational. Since there's no mention of harassment or any policy violation by the teacher, and the student's behavior was the issue, the teacher might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that the power dynamic is a problem. A teacher pointing out something so personal, even if well-intentioned, could be misinterpreted. However, the teacher's actions were to correct a dress code violation. The student's reaction might be more about embarrassment than the teacher being a creep. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). The teacher acted professionally to address a student's behavior without causing public confrontation, and unless the school has specific policies against such methods, he's justified. The student's friends' reactions might stem from not understanding the situation rather than the teacher being wrong.\n"
