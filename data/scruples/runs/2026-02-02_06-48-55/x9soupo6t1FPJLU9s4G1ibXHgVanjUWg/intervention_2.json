I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear by putting her feet up. He tried different ways to address it: ignoring it first, then passing a note. The student got angry and now he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the teacher acted appropriately. The student's actions could be seen as a clothing choice or a lack of awareness. The teacher's response was passing a note saying her underwear is showing. The student reacted negatively, and now others are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, schools usually have strict guidelines about teacher-student interactions to prevent any appearance of impropriety. Even though the teacher's intention was to correct the student, the method of communication (a note) could be problematic. It might be seen as an invasive or inappropriate way to address a student's clothing, especially if the school has policies against such communication. \n\nAlso, the teacher is a male and the student is female, which could lead to assumptions or accusations, even if unintended. The fact that the student is an upperclassman and the teacher is in a position of authority adds another layer. The teacher might have overstepped by directly addressing the underwear issue, regardless of intent.\n\nThe alternative options the teacher considered\u2014like speaking in person or via email\u2014might have been better if done properly. However, the note might be the least problematic option, but it's still a gray area. The student's reaction suggests she felt embarrassed or offended, which could be valid if the teacher's approach was awkward or unprofessional.\n\nConsidering all factors, even if the teacher's intention was good, the method might be seen as inappropriate. Schools often prioritize avoiding any situation that could be misinterpreted. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong based on how the situation was handled.\n"
