I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is that a male teacher noticed a female student was showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it, including a note, but now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female. The student was wearing skirts and shorts, and her behavior might be unintentional. The teacher tried to address it without making her feel humiliated. He considered several methods: holding her after class, emailing, but decided on a note. The note was straightforward but direct. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the teacher did the wrong thing. From a professional standpoint, teachers should maintain appropriate boundaries. However, in this case, the teacher was trying to correct a student's attire, which could be seen as necessary. However, the method he used\u2014passing a note about her underwear\u2014might be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamics in a teacher-student relationship. Even if the student was the one showing, the teacher's approach could be perceived as too direct or crossing a boundary. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher should have addressed it in a more formal or respectful way. For example, maybe discussing it in private during a scheduled meeting, or through the school's appropriate channels. Emailing the student might have been better, even if he was concerned about how it would look. Alternatively, talking to the student in a professional manner after class without embarrassing her. \n\nBut the student's actions were repeated, and the teacher was uncomfortable. The note was meant to be discreet. However, the note could be misinterpreted. The student might have felt embarrassed or humiliated, leading to the negative reaction. In a school setting, even if the teacher's intention was good, the method might not align with professional standards. \n\nI think the key points are the power dynamic and the method of communication. While the teacher was trying to help, the way he did it might have been unprofessional. So, the answer might be A (the teacher is in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. Some might argue that the teacher acted appropriately to address the situation without public humiliation. However, the note about underwear is personal and could be seen as crossing a line. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
