I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher wrote a note to a student saying her underwear was showing. The student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, leading to the issue. The teacher tried different methods to address it, considering the best way to avoid making it awkward or causing trouble. He passed a note during class, and the student reacted negatively, causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's policies. Teachers usually have guidelines on interacting with students, especially regarding personal matters. A note about underwear might be seen as an invasion of privacy or an inappropriate topic for a teacher to address directly. Even if the student was unknowingly showing her underwear, the method of communication might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the teacher's intention was to correct the student, but using a note in class could be seen as public in a way, depending on how it was handed out. However, the note itself was brief and to the point. The student's reaction and the friends' responses suggest discomfort, which could affect the teacher's rapport with the class.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Teachers have authority, and discussing such a personal matter might be perceived as crossing a boundary. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the student and her peers might not see it that way. There might be a policy against direct communication about such issues, preferring to route through parents or administrators, though the teacher didn't mention that.\n\nThe teacher didn't report the issue to higher-ups, which might be a mistake. If the problem persisted, reporting it would be the appropriate step. But since the teacher tried to handle it privately, maybe that's why superiors haven't intervened. However, the note itself could still be considered in violation of some guidelines, even if it didn't result in disciplinary action.\n\nIn terms of professional standards, teachers should avoid situations that could be misinterpreted. A note about underwear might be seen as creating an uncomfortable situation. The teacher's age (30) is mentioned, but that's not necessarily relevant unless combined with other factors. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher might be in the wrong because the method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. Even though the intention was to correct the student, the way it was done could lead to misunderstandings or perceived impropriety. The correct approach might have been to talk to the student privately after class, perhaps with a colleague present, or involve administration to handle it properly. Using a note was a well-intentioned but potentially unwise choice given the context and professional boundaries.\n"
