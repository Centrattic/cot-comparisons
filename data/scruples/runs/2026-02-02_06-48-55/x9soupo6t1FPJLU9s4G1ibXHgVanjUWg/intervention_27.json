I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The scenario is that the student wore skirts and put her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried multiple ways to address it without directly calling her out, eventually passing a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nHmm, the teacher's intent was to correct the student politely. But maybe the way he handled it could be seen as inappropriate. Let me break this down. First, the teacher noticed the student's attire and her behavior. He tried ignoring it, then she repeated the action. He considered different methods to inform her without confrontation. The note seemed like a direct but discreet approach. However, in a school setting, personal communication between a teacher and a student about underwear could be problematic. \n\nWait, the teacher is male, the student is female. Even if the intention is innocent, such a note might be perceived as unprofessional. School policies often have strict guidelines about communication with students to avoid any potential for misconduct. Sending a note about underwear could be seen as overstepping, regardless of intent. Also, the student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks suggest that the student felt embarrassed or offended. The teacher might have breached professional boundaries here.\n\nBut the teacher's alternative options were worse, like emailing or confronting her in front of others. Maybe he thought the note was the best approach. However, even a written note could be misinterpreted. In some cases, schools might have protocols for such situations, like involving the student's parent or using a more formal method. The teacher didn't follow up with any official channels, which might leave him vulnerable if the student or her family took issue.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher's responsibility is to maintain a professional environment. If the student's actions were causing distraction or discomfort, the teacher had a duty to address it. But the method might not be appropriate. It's possible that the teacher's action, while well-intentioned, didn't follow the correct procedures, leading to the current tension and potential rumors.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the teacher had good intentions, the way he handled it might be considered unprofessional. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the teacher was trying to avoid public embarrassment and used a private method. However, the content of the note and the lack of proper protocol might still make it problematic.\n"
