I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear by having her feet up on the desk. He tried ignoring it, but after repeated incidents, he passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassing her in front of others. He considered different methods like talking after class or emailing but decided on a note. The key here is whether his actions were appropriate. The student's behavior might have been unintentional, so the teacher acting in a respectful way to correct it could be justified. However, the method of passing a note might have been seen as awkward or made the student uncomfortable. The student's reaction was scoffing, which suggests she might have felt humiliated or embarrassed. \n\nBut the teacher's primary concern was the student's awareness of her exposure, not harassment. Since he didn't make any inappropriate comments or follow up in a way that could be seen as predatory, the note might be seen as a direct but necessary action. However, the way it was delivered could be problematic. A better approach might have been to have a private conversation after class to explain politely. The note, while discreet, might have come off as too direct or awkward, leading to the student's perception of harassment. \n\nThe fact that there's no mention of the school administration taking action suggests that the teacher's action didn't violate policies. The students' reactions might be based on misunderstanding, but the teacher needs to handle it professionally. Maybe a follow-up conversation to clarify his intentions could help. \n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's action was intended to correct a situation where the student was unknowingly exposing herself, but the method might not have been the best. He's not in the wrong for pointing it out, but perhaps could have handled it more sensitively. So the answer is B for No.\n"
