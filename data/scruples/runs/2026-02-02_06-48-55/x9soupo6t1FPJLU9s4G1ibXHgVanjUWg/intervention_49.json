I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that the student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly without embarrassing the student in front of others. He considered other methods like holding her after class or emailing her but decided against them due to potential issues. The note seems like a direct but private way to address it. \n\nHowever, there are some concerns. As a male teacher and a student in a high school setting, the interaction could be sensitive. Even though the teacher's intention was to inform the student, the method might come off as inappropriate or could be misinterpreted, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and student. There's a risk of the note being seen as a way to communicate about a personal, possibly suggestive topic, which could lead to misunderstandings or rumors.\n\nAlso, the student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, indicating she might have been aware or perhaps found the note condescending. The subsequent dirty looks suggest that the student or her peers might perceive the note as invasive or inappropriate. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, school policies often have strict guidelines about teacher-student communication, especially regarding personal topics. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the method might not align with those policies, potentially leading to disciplinary action if reported. The teacher should have considered using a more formal approach, like discussing it in private during a scheduled meeting or involving another staff member as a witness to maintain professionalism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention was to help the student, the approach taken could be seen as crossing professional boundaries. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong due to the method of communication and the potential for misinterpretation in the context of a teacher-student relationship.\n"
