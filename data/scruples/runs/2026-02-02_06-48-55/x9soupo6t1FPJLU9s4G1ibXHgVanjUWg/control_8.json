I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school instructor who noticed a female student wearing skirts with her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried different ways to address it without making her feel embarrassed, finally using a note. The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his job.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the teacher's intention and the method he used. The teacher wanted to inform the student she was showing her underwear without making it a big deal. The note was direct but brief. The student's reaction was scoffing and putting her feet down, which suggests she understood the message. However, the aftermath caused tension.\n\nNow, considering the teacher's actions: Is it wrong to inform a student if their clothing is revealing? The teacher's intent wasn't to harass but to correct a situation. He took care to avoid public confrontation, which is commendable. However, the note might have been misinterpreted. In a professional setting, even well-intentioned actions can be seen as inappropriate if they involve personal details like underwear. The teacher, being in a position of authority, needs to maintain strict boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, students are minors, and teachers have a responsibility to address any situation that could lead to misunderstandings or discomfort. The student might not be aware of her appearance, so informing her is part of that responsibility. However, the method of passing a note about underwear might be too direct and could be perceived as intrusive. \n\nThere's also the aspect of gender dynamics here. A male teacher addressing a female student about her undergarments could be sensitive. The teacher's approach might be seen as overstepping, even if his intention was innocent. In some schools, there are policies against one-on-one communications about such matters, so using a note could be against those policies.\n\nBut the teacher did try to handle it discreetly, avoiding public embarrassment. The student didn't report any issue, and the school hasn't taken action. The main problem now is the student's reaction and potential rumors. The teacher's concern about reputation is valid, but he might need to address it with administration to clarify his intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's intent wasn't malicious, but the method could be problematic. However, since the student was the one causing the issue and the teacher acted to correct it without malice, he might not be in the wrong. It's a tricky situation where both parties might have valid points, but the teacher's actions were necessary and done with care.\n"
