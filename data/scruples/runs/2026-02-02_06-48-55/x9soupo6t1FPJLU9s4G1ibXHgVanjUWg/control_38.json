I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. So the scenario is a male teacher notices a female student wearing a skirt and has her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. He passes her a note saying so. The student reacts negatively, and now others are giving him dirty looks. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is trying to address a student's appearance in a way that's respectful. But how appropriate is it for a teacher to comment on a student's underwear? There are boundaries in teacher-student interactions. Even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. \n\nThe teacher had multiple instances where the student was showing her underwear. He tried different methods to address it\u2014emailing, holding her back, but decided on a note. But passing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic. Even if the student didn't realize, the teacher's approach might come off as intrusive or creepy, especially since it's a male teacher and a female student. \n\nAlso, the aftermath: the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, which suggests the student felt embarrassed or offended. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because even if he's not at fault, perceptions matter in such situations. \n\nI should also consider school policies. If the school didn't address it, maybe the method wasn't a violation, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right approach. The teacher might have handled it differently by involving the student's parents or following formal procedures, but he chose to handle it directly. However, the note might be seen as a breach of professional boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's intention was to help the student, not to harass. There's a difference between addressing a student's attire and inappropriate behavior. If the student's actions were distracting or against dress code, the teacher has a responsibility. But the way he handled it could be problematic. \n\nSo the key points are: appropriateness of the method, power dynamics, potential for misunderstanding, and the impact on professional relationships. The teacher might not be in the wrong legally or according to school policy, but ethically, there's a question about how he approached it. The correct answer would likely be that he is in the wrong because the method was inappropriate despite the good intention.\n"
