I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the teacher, a man, notices a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, which causes her underwear to show. He tried ignoring it, but she kept doing it. He eventually passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is a male in a position of authority. The student is a female student. The teacher is trying to address an issue where the student's clothing and behavior are causing an issue. But the way he handled it\u2014passing a note about her underwear\u2014might be problematic. \n\nWhy would that be problematic? Well, there's a power dynamic here. The teacher has authority over the student, and any personal communication between them can be sensitive. Even if the teacher's intention was to help, the note could be perceived as inappropriate or even harassing. Especially since the student is a minor and the teacher is an adult. \n\nAlso, there's the issue of how to address such a situation. Maybe the better approach would have been to talk to the student privately after class, focusing on the behavior (putting feet on the desk) rather than the clothing. But the teacher chose to mention the underwear directly, which is more personal and could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAnother thing to consider is school policies. Many schools have strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. Emailing a student about underwear might be against policy, but passing a note could also be seen as an improper interaction. The teacher's concern about rumors affecting his career suggests he's aware of the risks. \n\nThe student's reaction\u2014scoffing and putting her feet down\u2014might indicate she didn't realize the issue before. But the friends giving dirty looks implies that the note's content might have been spread or taken the wrong way. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the method could be seen as overstepping his role. \n\nIn terms of professional boundaries, teachers should avoid any situation that could be perceived as inappropriate. The note could be interpreted as the teacher being focused on the student's body rather than her behavior. Even if he's not harassing, the action might still be considered unprofessional. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The teacher's intention was to address an issue, but the method he used might have crossed professional boundaries. The situation could lead to perceptions of harassment or inappropriate attention, even if he didn't mean it that way. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for handling it that way.\n"
