I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher did the wrong thing here. So, the situation is a male high school teacher who saw a student's underwear because she was sitting with her feet up on the desk. The teacher passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. He wanted to inform her politely without embarrassing her. He tried different methods like holding her after class or emailing but decided against them because he didn't want to make it awkward. The note seemed like a direct but private way to address it. However, passing a note about someone's underwear in a school setting might be problematic. High schoolers are teenagers, and even if the teacher's intention was good, the message could be misinterpreted. \n\nFrom the student's perspective, receiving a note from a teacher about her underwear could make her feel uncomfortable or harassed, especially if she didn't realize she was showing. Even if she didn't, the note might come off as intrusive. The teacher is an authority figure, and any personal communication like that could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. \n\nAlso, the fact that the student and her friends now give him dirty looks suggests that the message might have been taken the wrong way. The teacher is worried about rumors, which is a valid concern because in a school environment, such communications can easily be misunderstood or exaggerated.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was trying to be considerate and avoid public embarrassment. But the method he chose might not have been appropriate. Maybe a better approach would have been to address it in a more formal and professional manner, perhaps during a private meeting, even if it's awkward. The note bypasses that formality and could be seen as a breach of professional boundaries.\n\nSo, while the teacher's intention was to help, the method he used might not have been professional. The key issue here is the appropriateness of the communication method in a teacher-student relationship. The teacher should maintain clear boundaries, and discussing personal matters like underwear in this context could overstep. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong because the method of communication was inappropriate, even if the intent was good.\n"
