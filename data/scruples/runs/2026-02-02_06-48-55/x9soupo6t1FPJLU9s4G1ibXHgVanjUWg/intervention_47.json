I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing\" to a student who was unknowingly flashing her underwear. The teacher felt uncomfortable but handled it by writing a note. The student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, and the student is female. The situation involves the student's clothing choice and her behavior (putting feet up). The teacher's intention was to inform her without embarrassing her. However, the note could be seen as inappropriate or a breach of boundaries, especially in a teacher-student relationship.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers should maintain appropriate boundaries. Even if the intention was good, a direct, in-person conversation might have been better. A note could be misinterpreted. Also, the student might not have realized she was showing, so the teacher's approach was to avoid public embarrassment. However, the teacher's method of communication (note) might not be the best. \n\nAnother angle: the student's clothing choice is her own business, but if it's part of the school's dress code, the teacher should address it according to policies. But the teacher isn't reporting her, just pointing it out. However, the way it was done\u2014handwritten note\u2014could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the teacher's concern about being seen as a creep is valid because of the power dynamic. Even if the message was innocent, the act of a teacher writing about a student's underwear could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nConsidering all that, the teacher might be in the wrong for not handling it through official channels or a more appropriate method. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Maybe the teacher's actions were reasonable, but the method was poor. Alternatively, maybe the student's behavior was not appropriate, and the teacher was just correcting it. \n\nBut in professional settings, teachers should avoid any personal, written messages of that nature. They should use school-appropriate methods, like talking to the student in private or involving a staff member if needed. So the note was a bad idea. The teacher's intentions might be good, but the approach was unprofessional. Therefore, the answer is A."
