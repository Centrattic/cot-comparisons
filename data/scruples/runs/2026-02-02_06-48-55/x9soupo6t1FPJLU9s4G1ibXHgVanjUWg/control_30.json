I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher did the wrong thing by telling the student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, the teacher is male, and the student is female. The situation involves the student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which accidentally reveals her underwear. The teacher feels uncomfortable but initially ignores it. After several instances where this happens, he decides to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacts with scoffing and puts her feet down, but then she and her friends give him dirty looks, leading to concerns about his professional relationships and potential rumors.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Legally, is there an issue? In many places, teachers are advised to avoid any private communication with students that could be misinterpreted. A note about underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic. Even if the teacher's intent was to correct a wardrobe malfunction, the method of communication could be problematic. \n\nEthically, the teacher's concern is valid\u2014ensuring the student isn't aware she's showing her underwear. However, the way he chose to address it (a private note) might create more issues. There's a risk of it being perceived as harassment or inappropriate attention, regardless of the teacher's actual intentions. \n\nAlternatives the teacher could have considered: maybe addressing it in front of the class in a general way, like reminding students to be mindful of their attire, or perhaps having a conversation with the student in a public setting, such as during a break when others are around. Emailing a parent might also be an option if the behavior continued, but the teacher didn't mention that. \n\nThe fact that the student and her friends now view the teacher negatively suggests that the approach didn't work well. The teacher's method might have inadvertently made things worse. In professional settings, it's crucial to avoid any actions that could lead to misunderstandings or be used against them. \n\nSo, even though the teacher's intention was to help the student, the method chosen might be considered unwise or inappropriate given the context. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the approach taken could be seen as crossing professional boundaries.\n"
