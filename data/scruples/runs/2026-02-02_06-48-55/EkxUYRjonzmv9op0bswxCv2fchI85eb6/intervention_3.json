It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after considering terminating a pregnancy due to the baby having Down syndrome and spina bifida, and because the surrogate was using drugs and alcohol. \n\nFirst, surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic and not for profit. The couple didn't want to have a child with disabilities and are now considering not taking the child. The surrogate broke the agreement by using substances during pregnancy, which could affect the baby.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, even if the surrogate violated the agreement, the couple might still have obligations. They might not have the right to terminate the pregnancy unless the contract allows it. Legally, the couple might be bound to proceed with the birth unless there's a clause allowing termination in such circumstances.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The couple's decision is based on their readiness to care for a child with disabilities, which is a personal choice. However, using the surrogate's misconduct as a reason to abandon the child could be seen as using that as an excuse. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions also add another layer of complexity, as she's not following the agreed-upon terms of the surrogacy.\n\nThe couple might be in a difficult position, but the core issue is whether they have the right to refuse the child. If they can't legally terminate the pregnancy, continuing it might be their responsibility. If the surrogate's actions have legal consequences, maybe they can seek legal advice to see if they can disengage from the surrogacy. But ethically, choosing not to take the child could be seen as abandoning a life they created, especially if the disabilities were not known beforehand.\n\nThe fact that they didn't want to be caregivers for the long term might make their decision more about their own ability rather than the child's well-being. That could be viewed as selfish, especially if they knew the risks of surrogacy and chose it knowing the potential for complications.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're avoiding responsibility for a child they helped create, using the surrogate's actions as a cover. Alternatively, if the surrogate's actions legally invalidate the surrogacy, maybe they have grounds. But ethically, it's a tough call. I think leaning towards them being in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own convenience over the child's future.\n"
