It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the baby is likely to have Down Syndrome and spina bifida. The parents are considering refusing the child now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by location, but the scenario mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. In many jurisdictions, even in altruistic surrogacy, the legal rights of the surrogate and intended parents are defined. If the surrogate has breached the agreement by using substances, there might be legal grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, once the child is born, the parents might still have legal obligations depending on local laws.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The parents are worried about caring for a child with significant disabilities and the lifestyle changes that entails. They feel they aren't prepared for that. There's a lot of debate around the ethics of continuing a pregnancy for severe disabilities. Some argue that life is valuable regardless of abilities, while others believe it's about the parents' capacity to provide care. The parents might be seen as prioritizing their own convenience, but they're also considering the child's future well-being.\n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014pose serious risks to the child's health. This could be considered a breach of trust, adding another layer to the parents' decision. However, the surrogate might have her own struggles, like the stress mentioned, which could mitigate some responsibility.\n\nThe parents haven't reported the surrogate yet, which might be because they're still processing the information. But in some places, there might be mandatory reporting of substance abuse during pregnancy, which could complicate things legally and ethically.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's rights. Even if the parents feel unprepared, the child has a right to life, and the parents' decision to refuse the child could be seen as negating that right. On the other hand, the parents are not in a position to provide adequate care, which raises questions about the child's best interests.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a complex situation. The parents' decision isn't straightforward. Legally, if the surrogate violated the agreement, the parents might have grounds to terminate. Ethically, it's a tough call between the child's right to life and the parents' well-being. However, the key point is that the parents are not obligated to become caregivers if they aren't prepared, especially if the surrogate's actions further compromised the pregnancy. So, the answer might be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
