It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby because they didn't plan for these conditions and feel their lives would drastically change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The surrogacy was altruistic, not for profit. The surrogate broke the agreement by using substances during pregnancy, which could harm the baby. The couple might feel that the surrogate violated the terms, so maybe they have a right to reconsider. However, the baby's well-being is also a factor. Even if the surrogate made mistakes, the child needs a safe environment once born.\n\nNext, the couple's reasons for not wanting the baby are about being unprepared to care for a child with such conditions. They mention that it would change their lives fundamentally, and they don't think they can handle it. That's a personal choice, but does that make them the \"assholes\"? On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family. On the other hand, the child's future is at stake. If they walk away, the child would need another home, and the surrogate might be left in a difficult position.\n\nLegal aspects might also come into play. Since surrogacy is altruistic and illegal for profit, the legal framework might not support the couple terminating the pregnancy now, especially after the surrogate has carried it this far. They might have to take responsibility regardless of the baby's condition. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the surrogacy contract, giving the couple grounds to end the agreement. But it's unclear what the terms of the altruistic agreement specify.\n\nThe emotional and moral dimensions are complex. The couple is stressed and unprepared, but the surrogate is also under stress and made poor choices. The question is whether their decision to refuse the baby is a form of abandonment. However, they have the right to choose not to parent, but they might have a responsibility to ensure the child is placed in a good home afterward. They might need to report the surrogate's behavior to protect the child, but they haven't done that yet, which could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision is influenced by their inability to cope with the child's needs and the surrogate's breach of the agreement. While they are not obligated to parent a child they didn't plan for, the way they handle the situation could affect the child's welfare. They might not be in the wrong for re-evaluating their commitment, but they have a responsibility to act in the child's best interest once born. The answer might depend on the legal and ethical obligations they have as intended parents in this altruistic surrogacy arrangement.\n"
