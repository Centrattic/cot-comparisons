It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby after finding out about the health issues and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The scenario mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal here. So, the arrangement is altruistic. If the surrogate is breaching the agreement by using substances, maybe there are legal consequences. But the parents are also considering terminating the pregnancy, which might have legal implications depending on the laws in their country.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The parents are worried about the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with Down syndrome and spina bifida. They might feel unprepared, which is a valid concern. However, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014could be seen as endangering the child. Is it right to terminate because of that? Or should they proceed despite the risks?\n\nThe parents might argue that they didn't sign up for these complications and that the surrogate's actions make the situation worse. But others might say that once a pregnancy is underway, they have a responsibility, especially since they chose surrogacy for a biological child. The question of when they can refuse the baby is key here. If they can legally terminate, maybe they're not in the wrong for considering it. But if they can't, maybe they are.\n\nThere's also the emotional angle. The surrogate is stressed and using coping mechanisms. The parents might feel that she's neglected her responsibilities. However, the parents' decision to walk away could leave the surrogate in a difficult position. Are they being selfish by not taking the child?\n\nI should also think about the child's rights. If the child is born with disabilities, do they have the right to life? The parents might not feel equipped to care for them, but others might argue that the child deserves a chance regardless.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's not a clear-cut case. The parents' decision is influenced by their readiness and the surrogate's actions. Legally, they might have options, but ethically, it's debatable. The answer depends on how much weight is given to the parents' right to choose versus the child's right to life and the surrogate's responsibilities.\n"
