It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child after learning about the potential disabilities and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple used a surrogacy agency because the wife has medical issues. The surrogate is altruistic, not for profit. They found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not taking the baby.\n\nThe author says they didn't want to be caregivers for a child with those conditions. They feel the surrogate was irresponsible by using harmful substances. But they're worried about being seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, in countries where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be specific laws about what happens if issues arise. The author might need to check legal options, like termination or adoption, but the question is more about moral wrong.\n\nEthically, people have different views. Some might say the couple has the right to decide their family's future, especially if they're not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. Others might argue that life should be protected regardless of circumstances, making the couple wrong for considering termination.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. If she violated agreed-upon terms (like avoiding harmful substances), the couple might feel justified in reconsidering. However, if the child is biologically theirs, does that affect responsibility?\n\nAnother angle: the couple might feel pressure from society to not abandon the child, but they're also considering their own well-being. It's a tough balance. The author's mention of \"toying with a life\" suggests they see the surrogate's actions as a betrayal, which could influence their decision.\n\nBut does that make them in the wrong? If the surrogate's actions increased the risk, maybe the couple isn't at fault. However, choosing to terminate or refuse the child after the surrogate's mistake could be seen as abandoning responsibility. It's a complex mix of personal ethics, legal considerations, and societal expectations.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the couple isn't to blame for the child's condition or the surrogate's actions. On the other hand, deciding not to take the child might be seen as abandoning a life they partially created. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to check if that aligns with possible reasoning.\n\nIn the end, it's a personal decision, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on the ethical stance taken. If the society values the sanctity of life and responsibility, then the author might be wrong. If personal choice and well-being are prioritized, then maybe not. The answer isn't straightforward, but I need to pick A or B.\n"
