It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a surrogate who then reveals she's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering refusing the baby after the amniocentesis shows potential Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of surrogacy laws. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's altruistic. That means the surrogate isn't being paid, which might affect the legal and ethical considerations. In many countries, even with altruistic surrogacy, there are legal agreements to protect both parties. However, if the surrogate has violated the terms (like substance use during pregnancy), that could be a point of legal action.\n\nNext, the couple's reasons for not wanting the baby now are twofold: the health issues of the baby and the surrogate's actions. The couple might be facing a dilemma between their initial agreement to accept the child regardless of health issues and the new information about the surrogate's behavior. They might feel that the surrogate's actions have compromised the child's health, adding to their stress.\n\nEthically, this is complex. The couple's stance could be seen as prioritizing their own readiness and mental health. However, refusing the child based on disabilities could be viewed as discriminatory. Also, the surrogate breaking the agreed-upon terms by using substances during the pregnancy might shift some responsibility, but it's a sensitive area because surrogacy agreements might not always cover such situations in detail.\n\nLegally, if the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) were known at the start, the couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement or seek legal recourse. However, since it's an altruistic arrangement, the legal framework might be less clear. The couple's options might include reporting the surrogate to the agency, consulting a lawyer, or considering adoption for the child if possible. \n\nThe emotional aspect is also important. The couple is dealing with the stress of infertility, the unexpected health issues, and the surrogate's actions. Their feelings of being unprepared for a child with significant needs are valid, but the decision to refuse the child raises questions about their responsibility and the surrogate's accountability.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The couple isn't in the wrong if they can demonstrate that the surrogate's actions directly impacted the child's health and that they made a decision based on both medical findings and the surrogate's breach of the agreement. However, if the refusal is solely based on the child's disabilities, that could be seen as unethical or discriminatory. But considering the additional factor of the surrogate's non-compliance, the couple might have a more justified stance.\n\nI think the key points are the surrogate's violation of the terms and the couple's responsibility. The answer would depend on whether the couple's decision is based on the surrogate's actions and medical risks or on the child's disabilities. If they're combining both factors, their position is more nuanced. However, if they're focusing solely on the child's condition, that could make them appear insensitive. The legal and ethical considerations here are intertwined, and the answer isn't black and white. But given the surrogate's actions, the couple might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
