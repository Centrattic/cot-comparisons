It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be found out about Down syndrome and spina bifida in the fetus.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, so it's altruistic. That might mean there's less legal structure compared to commercial surrogacy, which could complicate things. The surrogate breaking the agreement by substance use is a significant issue because surrogacy contracts often include terms about avoiding harmful substances. However, since it's altruistic, the legal enforceability might be different.\n\nEthically, the couple is struggling with whether they want to continue the pregnancy after the diagnosis. They feel unprepared for the lifelong care of a child with such conditions. The key points here are their right to make decisions about their family and the ethical implications of continuing a pregnancy they're not ready for. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are concerning because they could affect the fetus's health, adding another layer of complexity.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the \"assholes\" for not wanting the baby. Legally, if the surrogacy agreement allows termination or if they can demonstrate the surrogate's breach, they might have grounds. However, if the pregnancy has progressed beyond a certain point, termination might not be an option. They also have to consider the surrogate's well-being and the child's rights if born. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people might have differing opinions. Some might argue that they have the right to make the best decisions for their family, while others might feel they should take responsibility despite the challenges. The fact that the surrogate broke the terms adds to their justification for rethinking their commitment.\n\nI need to check if there's any point where the parents are in the wrong. They haven't reported the surrogate yet, which could be seen as withholding information, but they're still processing the situation. Their concern about being insensitive is valid, but they're also facing a situation that's impacting their future. \n\nOverall, the decision to refuse the baby is complex. The parents are reacting to new information and the surrogate's actions, which might give them a basis for reconsidering. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the legal framework and societal views on such decisions. Given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance here.\n"
