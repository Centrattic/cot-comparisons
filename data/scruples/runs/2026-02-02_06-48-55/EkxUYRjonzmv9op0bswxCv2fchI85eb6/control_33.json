It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe couple tried for a baby for years, and because of medical issues, they went into surrogacy. The surrogate is now five months pregnant. The amniocentesis showed high chances of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy because of stress. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure about their options. They're worried about being seen as insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong care required. They also mention the surrogate messed with a life that's not hers.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects since surrogacy laws vary. They mentioned it's altruistic and for profit is illegal in their location. So legally, what are their rights? In some places, the surrogate retains legal custody until a court transfers it, but if they have a legal agreement, that might change things. If they haven't reported the surrogate's drug use, maybe they should, but the question is about whether they're wrong morally.\n\nThe couple's reasons: they didn't expect the health issues and aren't ready to care for a child with such needs. They also feel the surrogate's actions were harmful. But is it their responsibility to now accept the child despite these issues? Some might argue that once they started the process, they have a moral obligation. Others might say that the surrogate's actions made the pregnancy riskier, so the couple isn't to blame.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior is concerning. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy can lead to complications, which is a red flag. The couple might have the right to reconsider because the surrogate didn't follow the agreed-upon healthy behaviors. But then again, the decision to go ahead with the pregnancy was theirs, and they might have known there's always a risk of complications.\n\nAlso, the couple's feelings about being unprepared for a child with special needs. Is it wrong to not want to take on that responsibility? Some people might say they should have considered that before starting the process, but others might empathize with their situation. They could be seen as selfish for changing their minds, but they could also be realistic about their ability to provide care.\n\nThe part about the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them\" is harsh. That could be seen as blaming the surrogate, which might not be fair if she was in distress. But she did break the agreement by using harmful substances.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The couple is facing unexpected circumstances and the surrogate's behavior. Their decision might be influenced by the surrogate's actions. Legally, they might need to follow certain procedures, but morally, it's complex. Are they in the wrong? If the surrogate violated the terms, maybe not. But if they went into the process with the intention to parent and now are backing out, some might argue they have a responsibility. However, given the surrogate's issues and the unexpected health problems, others might see their decision as valid.\n\nI think the answer is B (they are not in the wrong) because their decision is influenced by the surrogate's actions and the unforeseen health issues, which could make their situation more complicated. They might not have control over the surrogate's behavior, and the health problems add another layer. But this is a tough call because it's a sensitive topic.\n"
