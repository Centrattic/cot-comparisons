It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're going through a surrogacy arrangement because the wife has medical issues. The surrogate is now pregnant, and the amniocentesis shows a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking, which complicates things.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for considering refusing the baby. The user is asking if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The scenario mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. The laws around surrogacy can vary, but in many places, once the pregnancy is underway, the intended parents might not have the legal right to terminate. However, the surrogate's actions (drinking and smoking) could be a factor. The surrogate might be responsible for her behavior during pregnancy. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The intended parents are concerned about being caregivers for a child with significant needs. They might feel unprepared, which is a valid personal feeling. But from a moral standpoint, does that make them the \"assholes\"? They might argue that they never intended to have a child with these conditions and that the surrogate's actions added to the complications. \n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate is under stress and used substances as coping mechanisms. The intended parents might have known some risks but didn't expect these specific issues. However, they also didn't report the surrogate's actions yet, so there's a question about their responsibility to the child's well-being. \n\nAlso, the surrogate is carrying a child that's biologically theirs, so they might feel a connection. But they're now considering not taking the baby, which could leave the surrogate in a difficult situation, especially if she's already invested emotionally. \n\nLegally, if they can't refuse the baby, they might be obligated to take it, but if they can, they have to consider the surrogate's rights and the child's best interests. Ethically, the parents are facing a tough decision between their own preparedness and the child's future. \n\nI think the key points are the legal rights regarding termination, the surrogate's responsibility for her actions, and the parents' right to decide their family circumstances. The parents might not be in the wrong if they have legal recourse to terminate, especially if the surrogate's actions were a violation of the agreement. However, if they don't have that legal option, their decision to refuse might not be feasible, making the ethical dilemma even more complex. \n\nSince the user is asking if they are in the wrong, and considering the surrogate's actions and the parents' lack of preparedness, it's a nuanced situation. The parents might not be entirely wrong because they have legitimate concerns and the surrogate's actions were problematic. However, there's a risk of being seen as insensitive if they proceed to abandon the child. But since they're still figuring out their options, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, as they're trying to make a difficult decision under unexpected circumstances.\n"
