It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been trying to have a child for years, and due to medical issues, they used a surrogate. The surrogate is now five months pregnant with their biologically-related child. The amniocentesis results indicate a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Additionally, the surrogate disclosed that she has been drinking and smoking during pregnancy as coping mechanisms. The couple is now considering whether to proceed with the surrogacy, feeling overwhelmed by the potential responsibilities of raising a child with these conditions and upset about the surrogate's actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the medical conditions of the baby, the surrogate's behavior, and the couple's emotional/ethical dilemma. The question is whether the couple is in the wrong for considering refusing the child.\n\nLet me break it down. The couple is facing a difficult decision. They might feel they're not prepared for the lifetime commitment of caring for a child with significant health needs. But from an ethical standpoint, is it wrong for them to change their minds? Also, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are serious, as they can harm the fetus. However, the couple is now considering not taking the child, which might affect the surrogate's well-being and the child's future.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations: In altruistic surrogacy, the legal framework varies, but generally, the intended parents have certain rights. However, if the surrogate's actions (like substance use) are harmful, there might be legal implications. But in this case, the couple isn't reporting yet, which could be a point of contention. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, the couple is facing a tough situation. They might be criticized for backing out due to the child's disabilities, which could be seen as discriminatory. However, they also have the right to consider their own capacity to care for a child with such needs. The surrogate's behavior is problematic, but the couple's primary concern is their readiness as parents.\n\nAnother angle: The couple's main issue is that they didn't anticipate these challenges and are now overwhelmed. They might feel it's not in the child's best interest to be placed in a home unprepared to handle the needs. But once the child is born, the couple could be legally responsible. However, if the surrogate's actions contributed to the child's conditions, that complicates things.\n\nAlso, the couple's statement about the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them\" suggests they feel the surrogate was negligent. But the surrogate might have her own struggles, which the couple acknowledges is under stress. \n\nBalancing these factors, the question is whether the couple's decision to refuse the child is morally wrong. On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the child's needs and the surrogate's responsibilities are also important. \n\nConsidering that the couple is not in the wrong because they are making a difficult decision based on their circumstances, even if others might disagree. They are not the first to face such a dilemma. The surrogate's actions are indeed concerning, but the couple's right to decide their family's future is a significant factor. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, I need to make sure there's no aspect I missed. For example, if the surrogacy contract had clauses about termination in such cases, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Also, the ethical responsibility towards the child's well-being\u2014if they can't provide care, perhaps they should reconsider. But given the information, the couple is in a tough spot and their decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
