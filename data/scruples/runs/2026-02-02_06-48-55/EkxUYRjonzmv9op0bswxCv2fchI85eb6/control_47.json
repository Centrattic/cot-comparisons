It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, unexpected birth defects in the fetus, and the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant with a biologically theirs child. The amniocentesis showed high chances of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not accepting the baby, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're the \"assholes\" for not wanting the baby now. They're worried about being insensitive but feel unprepared for the lifelong caregiving required. They also mention the surrogate's actions potentially toying with life.\n\nLooking at ethical aspects: Surrogacy agreements vary, but in some places, especially altruistic ones, the legal rights might still be complex. The surrogate's behavior (substance use) could be a red flag, regardless of the surrogacy agency's stance. However, the couple's decision to terminate or refuse the child raises questions about their responsibility once the child is born.\n\nIn terms of rights, if the child is born with disabilities, the parents have a legal and moral obligation to care for it. Abandoning the child might not be an option, even with surrogacy. Also, the surrogate's actions might have legal consequences if they endangered the child, which could affect the parents' rights.\n\nThe couple's concern about being unprepared for special needs care is valid, but does that make them wrong? They might not have considered this possibility, but once the situation arises, they have a responsibility. The surrogate's actions complicate things further, as her substance use could impact the child's health. However, the parents might still have no choice but to take responsibility once the child is born.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, a child cannot be abandoned. Even if the surrogacy contract allows for termination, once the child is born, the legal guardians are responsible. The couple might need to explore their options carefully, possibly involving the agency, legal counsel, and authorities if necessary. But morally, the question is whether they can ethically refuse a child after agreeing to surrogacy. Their initial decision to proceed with surrogacy implies acceptance of potential risks, including birth defects. However, the surrogate's actions might shift some responsibility, but it's unclear if that absolves the couple.\n\nConsidering all this, the couple's decision to not want the baby might be seen as understandable in their personal context, but legally and ethically, they might not have the right to refuse the child once born. However, the surrogate's actions could complicate matters. It's a tough call, but the author might not be entirely in the wrong if they proceed responsibly, but they need to handle it through legal channels.\n"
