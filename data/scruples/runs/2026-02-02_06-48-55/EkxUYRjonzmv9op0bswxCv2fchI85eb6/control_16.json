It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been drinking and smoking during pregnancy, and the parents found out the fetus has a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. They're considering whether to continue with the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. The surrogate is in an altruistic surrogacy arrangement, which is legal in their country. However, she's broken the terms by using substances that are harmful during pregnancy. That's a serious issue because it could affect the health of the fetus. The parents have a right to expect that the surrogate is taking proper care of the baby, especially since it's their biological child.\n\nNow, the parents are facing a situation where the baby might have significant health challenges. They're questioning whether they should go through with the birth. They're not sure if they can refuse the baby now. Legally, in many jurisdictions, the intended parents in a surrogacy agreement usually have the right to make decisions regarding the pregnancy, including termination, especially if the surrogate's actions have jeopardized the fetus's health. However, this might depend on the specific laws and the terms of their surrogacy contract.\n\nEthically, the parents are struggling with the decision to terminate or proceed. They mention not wanting to be seen as insensitive, but they also feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such conditions. It's a tough spot, and their feelings are valid. However, the surrogate's actions might have already impacted the fetus's health, which complicates things. They have a responsibility to ensure the best interests of the child, but they also need to consider their own capacity to care for a child with disabilities.\n\nThe question is whether the authors (the parents) are in the wrong for considering refusing the baby. If they decide to terminate based on the surrogate's negligence, they might not be at fault. However, if they had already decided to proceed and then changed their mind without the surrogate's negligence, that's different. Here, the surrogate's actions could be seen as a breach of contract and duty of care, which might give the parents grounds to reconsider.\n\nAdditionally, the parents have a right to make decisions about their reproductive choices, but they also need to address the surrogate's actions appropriately, possibly through legal channels. Reporting her substance use is necessary for the child's health and safety, regardless of their decision on the pregnancy.\n\nIn summary, the parents aren't necessarily in the wrong because they're responding to a situation where the surrogate's actions have endangered the fetus. However, their decision should be guided by legal advice and ethical considerations, ensuring they handle the surrogate's behavior responsibly and think about the child's best interests.\n"
