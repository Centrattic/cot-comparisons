It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering terminating the pregnancy due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, especially after the surrogate revealed substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Surrogacy arrangements, especially altruistic ones, often have legal agreements in place. The key question is whether the intended parents have the right to refuse the child after the surrogate has carried the pregnancy. In many jurisdictions, once the pregnancy is underway, the rights might still lie with the surrogate unless there's a specific legal clause allowing termination under certain conditions. \n\nThen there's the issue of the surrogate's actions. She admitted to smoking and drinking, which are harmful to the fetus. The parents might feel betrayed, but they also need to consider the surrogate's well-being and the legal consequences of reporting her. However, the parents' decision to proceed or terminate now could affect both the surrogate and the potential child.\n\nEthically, this is complex. The parents are facing a significant life change if the child has disabilities. They might not be prepared for the long-term care required. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions could have contributed to the child's health issues, complicating their decision.\n\nLegally, if the surrogacy contract doesn't allow termination after a certain point, the parents might be bound by the agreement. They could face legal challenges if they attempt to terminate the pregnancy without the surrogate's consent. The surrogate might also have rights over the child, depending on local laws.\n\nThe parents might be seen as not in the wrong if the surrogacy contract permits termination for medical reasons, especially if the conditions pose severe health risks. However, if the contract doesn't allow for that, their refusal could be legally problematic. Additionally, the surrogate's substance use is a separate issue that might affect the case, but the parents' decision to refuse the child could be seen as abandoning a child with disabilities, which might be viewed ethically differently depending on societal values.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, some might argue that the parents have a right to make decisions about their family's future, while others might see it as abandonment. The parents' distress over the unexpected situation and the surrogate's actions adds layers to the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, whether the parents are in the wrong depends on the specific legal framework of their location and the terms of the surrogacy agreement. If legally allowed to terminate due to the medical findings, they might not be in the wrong. If not, they could face legal issues. Ethically, it's a complex decision with no clear right or wrong answer, but they might not be in the wrong if they proceed according to the law and their contract.\n"
