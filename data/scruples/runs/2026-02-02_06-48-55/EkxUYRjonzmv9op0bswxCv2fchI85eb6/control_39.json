It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering terminating the pregnancy after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida, plus the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit in their country. They haven't reported the surrogate's actions yet. Legally, if the surrogate is violating the agreement by using substances, there might be grounds to terminate the arrangement, but laws vary. They might need to consult the agency or a lawyer.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The parents are dealing with unexpected challenges. They argue that caring for a child with these conditions would drastically change their lives. They might feel unprepared. On the other hand, someone could say they have a responsibility once they started the process, especially since the child is biologically theirs. The surrogate's actions add another layer\u2014her substance use could affect the baby's health, which might be a valid reason to reconsider.\n\nThe parents also mention they didn't want the baby anymore. There's a debate about whether it's acceptable to decide against a child based on potential disabilities. Some view it as a personal choice, while others see it as discriminatory. The parents might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and circumstances, but others might argue they should accept the consequences of their decision to have a child via surrogacy.\n\nThe surrogate's breakdown suggests she was under stress. She might have struggled with the emotional burden, leading to her coping mechanisms. The parents might have responsibilities towards her, like ensuring she gets support, but if she's not adhering to medical advice, that could affect the child's health.\n\nThe key points are the legal rights regarding termination, the ethical stance on disability, and the surrogate's conduct. Without knowing the exact legal framework (like surrogacy laws in their country), it's hard to say definitively. However, from a general ethics perspective, while the parents' decision might be legally permissible, it's debatable whether they're in the wrong morally. They could be seen as making a difficult choice based on their circumstances, but others might criticize them for not accepting the child despite challenges.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) if they're following legal avenues and considering the surrogate's actions. But if they're terminating solely based on the child's disability without considering support options, some might argue they are in the wrong. However, the scenario shows they're distressed and unprepared, which complicates the judgment. Given the circumstances, the answer is likely B.\n"
