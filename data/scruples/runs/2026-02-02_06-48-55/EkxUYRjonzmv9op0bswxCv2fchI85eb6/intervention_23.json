It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child, but after an amniocentesis reveals high chances of Down syndrome and spina bifida, the surrogate admits to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and is unsure if they can refuse it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple went through a surrogacy process because the wife can't carry a pregnancy to term. They used an altruistic surrogate since surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant. The tests showed a high likelihood of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to substance use during pregnancy, which is a serious issue because it can affect the baby's health. The couple is now conflicted about whether they're the bad guys if they decide not to proceed with the child.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if the couple's decision to potentially refuse the baby is justified. Let's consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the couple could be seen as abandoning a child due to disabilities, which some might view as discriminatory. On the other hand, they have the right to make decisions based on their capacity to care for a child with special needs. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could also be a factor in the baby's health, which complicates things.\n\nThe surrogate's behavior is a red flag. If she broke the terms of the surrogacy agreement by using substances, the couple might have legal grounds to take action. However, the couple's main issue is with the potential disabilities of the child. They mention they're not ready to be caregivers for a child with such needs. It's important to note that their decision might be self-centered, but they're also considering the child's future and their own ability to provide care.\n\nSurrogacy agreements usually outline the responsibilities and rights of all parties. If the surrogate violated the agreement by using substances, the couple might have legal options, like terminating the pregnancy or pursuing legal action. However, this is a sensitive area, and legal systems vary. The couple's emotional response is understandable under stress, but the ethical implications need to be weighed.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the bad guys. From an ethical standpoint, it's complex. The couple's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own lives over the child's, but they might argue it's about providing the best possible care. The surrogate's actions add another layer, as her behavior could have harmed the baby. The key is whether the couple had prior knowledge of the surrogate's ability to adhere to the surrogacy terms.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple might be at fault if they made a commitment to have a child and now are backing out due to unforeseen circumstances. However, if the surrogate's actions significantly impacted the baby's health, that could shift the blame to her. The couple's hesitation to report her suggests they might be aware of her breach of agreement but are conflicted.\n\nLegally, surrogacy agreements can vary, but in many cases, the intended parents have rights, especially if the surrogate's actions endangered the child. The couple might need to consult their legal team to understand their options. Ethically, the decision is tough, but it's important to consider all parties' well-being. The surrogate's health and the child's future are also factors. However, the couple's primary responsibility is to their child, and if they feel they can't provide adequate care, that's a valid concern.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is understandable given the circumstances. They are facing a difficult decision with no perfect outcome. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the perspective: if judged purely on not wanting a child with disabilities, they might be seen as selfish. But considering the surrogate's actions and the legal/ethical implications, the situation is more nuanced. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their capacity to care for the child and the surrogate's breach of agreement, which complicates the scenario.\n"
