It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, leading the couple to consider not taking the baby. They found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic, not for profit, which might affect legal rights. In some places, surrogacy laws can be complex. The key points here are the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) and the couple's decision to potentially refuse the child now that they know about the health issues and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nLegally, even if the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, terminating the pregnancy at 5 months might not be straightforward. There might be legal rights for the child's well-being, especially if the child is already viable. Also, the couple's right to refuse the child after the surrogate's misconduct is another angle. They might have grounds to reconsider if the child's health is compromised due to the surrogate's actions.\n\nEthically, the couple's hesitation due to the child's potential disabilities raises questions. They might be seen as prioritizing their own readiness over the child's right to life. However, the surrogate's substance use adds another layer\u2014she might have neglected the child's health, which could be a reason for the couple to distance themselves, especially if the child's condition is exacerbated by her actions.\n\nThe couple's admission of fearing a life change to caregivers might indicate a lack of preparedness, which could be seen as self-centered. However, if the surrogate's actions directly contributed to the child's health issues, the couple might feel justified in reevaluating their commitment to a child that wasn't their fault.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the surrogate's accountability. If she knew the risks of her behavior and still proceeded, the couple could argue that the child's condition isn't entirely their responsibility. But if the couple feels they can't adequately care for the child due to these circumstances, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the decision to terminate or refuse the child after it's already developed complications is ethically tricky. The couple might face criticism for not accepting the child regardless of the situation, especially since they wanted a child for a long time. But given the surrogate's role in the child's current health status, their stance might be somewhat justified.\n\nIn terms of legal options, the couple might need to consult their surrogacy agency and legal team to understand their rights and responsibilities. If the surrogate's actions breached the surrogacy agreement, the couple might have legal recourse to avoid taking the child. But if the child's condition isn't directly caused by the surrogate, they might still be obligated to proceed.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the couple's decision is influenced by both the surrogate's actions and their own unpreparedness. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the legal context and ethical standpoint. If the surrogate's breach of contract is the main issue, the couple might not be in the wrong. However, if the focus is on the child's health conditions alone, their refusal could be seen as unethical. The answer isn't straightforward, but given the surrogate's misconduct, the couple's decision might be more defensible.\n"
