It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple using a surrogate to have a child. The surrogate is pregnant with their biologically their child. The parents found out through an amniocentesis that the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds to their stress and makes them consider not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws can be really complex. Since it's altruistic and not for profit, maybe the legal obligations are different. The key question is whether the couple can terminate the pregnancy now. In many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements have clauses about termination, especially if the child has severe issues. But if they haven't included such terms, it might be complicated. They might need to involve the agency or legal counsel to see if they can proceed.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The couple is feeling unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with disabilities. They might be worried about the financial and emotional burden. However, deciding not to proceed after the pregnancy is already in the second trimester raises ethical concerns. It's about the potential life and the surrogate's role. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might be a factor, but they also seem remorseful. The couple's decision could be seen as abandoning the child, which is harsh, but they might not be at fault if the surrogate's actions contributed to the situation.\n\nAlso, the surrogate's well-being is a factor. If she's under a lot of stress and is now remorseful, terminating the pregnancy might affect her emotionally. But if the parents aren't prepared to care for the child, maybe it's better for the child's sake to not be born into a situation where the parents are not supportive.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's rights. If the child is born with disabilities, the parents have a responsibility. But in many places, parents can't refuse a child once born unless there are extreme circumstances. The couple's hesitation might mean they're considering termination, which is a heavy decision. They might fear being seen as insensitive, and that's a valid concern.\n\nI need to weigh the couple's intentions. They tried for a long time to have a child and now face unexpected challenges. They might genuinely feel overwhelmed. However, they also have a legal agreement with the surrogate, and breaking it could be problematic. The surrogate's actions might void any agreement, but that's something they need to check.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision is influenced by their unpreparedness and the surrogate's actions. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the legal framework and the terms of their surrogacy agreement. Ethically, it's a tough spot, but their intentions are to provide the best care, albeit unprepared. The surrogate's behavior is a contributing factor, but it complicates their decision. I think there's a mix of circumstances here, and it's not a clear-cut case of right or wrong. However, given the information, I might lean towards the couple not being in the wrong because they're reacting to unexpected issues and the surrogate's actions, but it's a close call.\n"
