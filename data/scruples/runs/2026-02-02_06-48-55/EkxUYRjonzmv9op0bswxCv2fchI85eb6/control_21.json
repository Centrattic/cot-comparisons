It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. The intended parents found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering refusing the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in this case, it's altruistic and for profit is illegal. So, the surrogate isn't being paid, which might affect the legal agreements. The parents might have certain rights based on the surrogacy contract. But they haven't reported the surrogate's substance use yet. Legally, could they have a case? Maybe, but since it's illegal for profit, maybe the contract isn't enforceable? Not sure.\n\nEthically, the parents are deciding not to proceed with the pregnancy due to the baby's health issues. They mention feeling selfish but also a fear of becoming caregivers for a child with significant needs. Is it wrong to back out? Some might argue that they have a right to make that choice, especially if they feel unprepared. Others might say that once the pregnancy is underway, they have a moral obligation to the child and the surrogate.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a factor. If she violated the agreed-upon terms, maybe the parents have grounds to terminate the agreement. However, the parents are now considering refusing the baby, which could leave the surrogate in a difficult position. The child would then need to be taken in by someone else, possibly the surrogate or another family. This raises questions about the child's well-being and the surrogate's responsibility.\n\nThe parents are also feeling conflicted\u2014between their own readiness and the surrogate's actions. They might be in a legally gray area, but ethically, it's complicated. Are they in the wrong? If the contract allows for termination due to the surrogate's misconduct, maybe not. But if the contract is binding, they might be bound to accept the child regardless. The fact that they haven't reported the surrogate yet suggests they're unsure about the legal steps.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might say that life is a gift regardless of circumstances, and they should accept the child. Others might support the parents' right to make that choice, given the challenges involved. The parents are also under stress, trying to do what they think is best for their family.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are within their legal rights and the surrogacy agreement allows for such a situation, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the agreement didn't account for these issues, they might be. The surrogate's actions complicate things, as she may have breached her part of the agreement. The parents might be acting in their own interests, but whether that makes them the \"assholes\" depends on cultural and ethical perspectives.\n\nGiven the information, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions. However, I need to be careful. If the surrogacy contract requires them to accept the child regardless, then they could be in violation. But since the surrogate violated the terms by using substances, perhaps the parents have a valid reason to reconsider. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B.\n"
