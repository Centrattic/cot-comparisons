It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. Now, the fetus has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and are unsure if they can legally refuse it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple's main concern is their readiness to care for a child with significant disabilities. They mention that their lives would fundamentally change, and they're not ready for that. It's natural for parents to have expectations, but when unexpected challenges arise, it's a tough decision. Are they selfish for not wanting to take on this responsibility? Or is it reasonable to reassess when circumstances change?\n\nThen there's the surrogate's actions. She broke the agreement by using substances during pregnancy, which could affect the baby's health. The surrogate's health choices impact the child, so the couple might feel they were misled or that the surrogate violated trust. However, the surrogate was under stress and sought coping mechanisms, which could be seen as a personal struggle. But legally and ethically, she might be at fault here for not following the agreed-upon terms of the surrogacy.\n\nLegally, the situation varies by jurisdiction. Since surrogacy for profit is illegal there, it's likely governed by specific laws or agreements. If the couple can terminate the agreement or find another resolution based on the surrogate's actions, that might be an option. They might be within their rights to refuse the child if the surrogate breached the contract.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's rights come into play. Even if the parents are not ready, the child has a right to life and care. The couple might face criticism for not wanting the child, but they also have the right to consider their own circumstances. The surrogate's actions complicate things further\u2014she's responsible for the child's current health risks, which could shift some responsibility onto her.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The couple's decision could be seen as selfish if they abandon the child, but they might argue that the surrogate's actions made the situation unmanageable. The key factors are the surrogate's breach of the agreement, the couple's readiness, and the child's best interests. It's possible the couple isn't in the wrong because the surrogate's actions created unforeseen issues, and they're considering the long-term impact on their family. However, if they proceed to abandon the child, that could be seen as unethical. But since they haven't made a final decision and are seeking advice, it's unclear. Legal options might exist, so they might be justified in exploring them.\n"
