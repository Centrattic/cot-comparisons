It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Surrogacy is altruistic and illegal for profit, so it's not a commercial arrangement. The surrogate was supposed to carry the biological child of the intended parents. The main issues here are the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) and the parents' decision to not proceed with the birth.\n\nThe parents argue that having a child with Down syndrome or spina bifida would drastically change their lives, and they're not ready. They also mention the surrogate \"toying with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" The surrogate is breaking down, indicating she's under stress and used these substances as coping mechanisms.\n\nNow, legal aspects. Since it's illegal for profit, the contract might not be enforceable. In many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements are either unenforceable or heavily regulated. If the parents want to refuse the baby, they might face legal challenges. The surrogate's actions might have violated the terms of the surrogacy agreement, especially if she was supposed to take care of the fetus. But without a legal contract, it's hard to say.\n\nEthically, the parents have a right to make decisions about their family. However, the child is already in the surrogate, so they can't just terminate it if the surrogate decides not to. If the surrogate continues the pregnancy, the parents are responsible. But the surrogate's behavior could affect the child's health, adding to their concerns.\n\nThe parents might feel they are being unfair to the child, but they're also in a situation where they were not prepared for these conditions. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, which complicates things. However, the parents' decision to refuse could abandon the child, even if the surrogate's actions were a factor.\n\nAlso, the parents' initial motivation for surrogacy was to have a child they couldn't due to medical reasons. Now they're considering not taking the baby, which could leave the surrogate with a child she didn't plan to raise and the child without parents. The parents might be in the wrong for not following through after the surrogate already carried the baby, regardless of the circumstances. But the surrogate's behavior might be a factor in the parents' decision.\n\nIn some places, even if surrogacy is altruistic, the intended parents might not have a legal right to refuse the baby after a certain point. The surrogate has a right to her own body, but if the agreement was that she would carry the child without harmful substances, then her actions might be a breach. However, in the absence of a legal contract, it's unclear.\n\nThe parents might feel they are being responsible by considering the well-being of the child and their own ability to care for it. But others might argue that once the child is born, they have a responsibility regardless of the condition. The question is about whether they are wrong to not want the baby anymore. The answer might depend on the legal context and the ethical stance one takes. If the surrogate's actions were a breach, maybe the parents are justified. But if the surrogate didn't know about the risks, or if the parents are using this as an excuse, then maybe not.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), if they have the right to refuse based on the surrogate's actions and the medical conditions. But without clear legal standing, it's tricky. However, the parents' primary concern is their readiness to care for a child with disabilities, which could be seen as a personal choice. But the surrogate's smoking and drinking might also be a significant ethical issue. The parents might be in the right to not take the baby if the surrogate violated the terms, but if they're just deciding based on the child's condition, that's more controversial. It's a complex situation. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B, but not entirely sure.\n"
