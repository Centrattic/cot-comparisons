It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves surrogacy, an unexpected diagnosis, and the surrogate's actions. \n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the couple is wrong for considering refusing the child. The surrogate is carrying a baby that has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, which the couple wasn't prepared for. They also found out the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which the surrogate admitted under stress.\n\nFrom the description, the surrogacy is altruistic since it's illegal for profit in their country. The couple went through a lot to get pregnant, but now they're facing a situation where their expectations have changed. The key points here are the medical diagnosis and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, once the surrogate is pregnant, the intended parents might not have the option to terminate the pregnancy without the surrogate's consent, especially if it's not for-profit. This could mean the couple might not have a legal choice anymore. However, the ethical question is different. \n\nThe couple argues they didn't sign up for these conditions and aren't prepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such conditions. They might feel they're being unfair to the child, which contradicts their initial desire to have a family. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. Her smoking and drinking could have affected the fetus, but she might be under stress from the situation, too.\n\nIs it selfish to not want the child? Some might say that once a pregnancy is underway, the parents have a responsibility, especially since the child is biologically theirs. Others might argue that the parents have the right to make decisions based on their circumstances, especially if they're not prepared for the challenges. The surrogate's actions might also be a point of contention\u2014she broke the agreement by using harmful substances, which the couple might see as invalidating the surrogacy contract.\n\nBut what about the child's welfare? If the couple refuses the child, it would go through the surrogate, who might not be equipped to raise a child with such needs. The legal system might get involved if the couple can't take the child, leading to a custody battle. However, the couple could also be seen as making a difficult decision to protect themselves from an unprepared life, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe surrogate's breach of contract (using substances) might give the couple grounds to terminate the surrogacy agreement, but that depends on the legal framework. If they can't legally terminate, then their refusal might not be feasible. However, morally, they might feel justified in their decision if the surrogate violated terms they agreed upon.\n\nIn summary, the situation is complex. The couple's decision isn't purely based on the child's condition but also the surrogate's actions. Whether they're in the wrong depends on legal precedents and societal values. Some might see their decision as selfish, while others might empathize with their unpreparedness. However, considering the surrogate's breach, the couple might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
