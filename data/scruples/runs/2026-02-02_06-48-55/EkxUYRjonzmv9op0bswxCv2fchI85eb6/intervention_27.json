It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a couple who used a surrogate to have a child. The surrogate is now pregnant, but the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal where they are, so it's altruistic. That might affect the legal rights and obligations. If the surrogate is altruistic, maybe the legal framework is different from commercial surrogacy. They might have agreed on certain terms, but if the baby has health issues, can they back out?\n\nThen, the surrogate's actions: she was smoking and drinking. That's a serious breach of the agreed terms, as surrogates are expected to take care of the baby. This could affect the health of the fetus. The couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement because she's not following the necessary health protocols. But they haven't reported it yet, which means they might be considering their options.\n\nThe couple's feelings are also important. They mention not being prepared to care for a child with such conditions. It's their choice whether they want to proceed with the pregnancy, but once the baby is born, can they legally refuse it? In many places, once the child is born, the intended parents have legal custody unless there's a reason to terminate the surrogacy before birth. If they terminate the pregnancy now, that's a different ethical issue. If the baby is born and they refuse, the surrogate might have legal standing as the biological mother, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nEthically, the couple is conflicted. They didn't anticipate the medical issues and are now facing a significant life change. However, the surrogate's behavior complicates things. Was her smoking and drinking a breach of the surrogacy agreement? If so, the couple might have legal recourse. But even so, terminating the pregnancy at 5 months is a major decision. Also, considering the child's well-being, if the baby is born with these conditions, the couple might have a responsibility to care for it if they are the legal parents.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the couple is in the wrong. But I need to weigh both sides. The surrogate's actions were harmful, but the couple's decision to back out after the fact might not be entirely their fault. However, once they've committed to surrogacy, they might have a responsibility regardless of the child's health. Also, the couple's reasoning about not being ready to be caregivers could be seen as selfish, but it's a personal choice. The question is whether they are in the wrong for not wanting the baby after these circumstances.\n\nIn terms of legal options: if the surrogacy contract allows for termination due to the surrogate's actions or medical issues, they might be able to proceed. If not, they might be stuck. The ethical dilemma is whether their decision is selfish or a valid choice based on their preparedness and circumstances. The surrogate's actions add another layer, possibly making her responsible for the situation. But the couple's decision to refuse the baby could still be seen as wrong, depending on societal views on disability and parental responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on the legal context and the terms of the surrogacy agreement. If they can legally terminate due to the surrogate's misconduct, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they can't and they refuse the child, that might be the wrong choice. However, given the surrogate's actions and the unforeseen medical issues, maybe the couple is in a more sympathetic position. Still, the act of refusing a child, regardless of circumstances, is a heavy decision. I'm leaning towards the couple not being in the wrong because the surrogate broke the agreement, and the medical issues weren't known beforehand. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a tough call.\n"
