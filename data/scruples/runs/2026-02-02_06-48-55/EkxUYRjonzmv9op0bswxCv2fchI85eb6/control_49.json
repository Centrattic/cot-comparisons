It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple used a surrogate because the wife has medical issues preventing her from carrying a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Additionally, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not proceeding with the birth, and they're unsure if they can back out or what the consequences would be.\n\nThe main question is whether the couple is in the wrong for wanting to refuse the child now. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the couple is facing a significant life change if they proceed. Down syndrome and spina bifida require lifelong care, which they feel unprepared for. They might be worried about the financial, emotional, and physical burden. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have affected the fetus's health, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate is an altruistic participant, and the surrogacy was legal. The couple might have legal obligations here. If they terminate the pregnancy, it could be legally complex, depending on local laws. Emotionally, the surrogate is already stressed, and termination could have ethical implications for her as well. Also, the couple's hesitation might be seen as abandoning a potential child, which some might view as inhumane.\n\nBut from the couple's perspective, they were not informed about the surrogate's habits beforehand, which could be a breach of trust. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the fetus's conditions. The couple's decision could be based on the reality that they aren't prepared to handle the challenges of a child with disabilities, which is a personal choice. However, others might argue that they should have considered the possibility of disabilities from the start and committed regardless.\n\nThe key points are: Did they have the right to proceed with the surrogacy knowing the surrogate's habits? Are they responsible for the consequences? Legally, in many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements can have clauses about termination, but since it's altruistic, maybe not as strict. Ethically, it's a tough call. The couple isn't at fault for not wanting the child if they weren't prepared, but the surrogate's actions complicate things. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the couple had the right to terminate under the agreement and if they were negligent in vetting the surrogate. Since the surrogacy is altruistic and in a country where it's illegal for profit, the legal framework might not be as clear. The couple's decision could be seen as self-centered if they proceed with termination after this, but if the surrogate's actions were the root cause, maybe they have grounds to be concerned about the child's health.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between the couple's right to make decisions about their family and the ethical responsibility towards the surrogate and the child. However, since they're considering termination due to unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's negligence, their position might be justifiable as they are not in the wrong.\n"
