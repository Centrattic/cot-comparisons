It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, but she's been using substances during pregnancy. The couple found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and they're considering refusing the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and for profit is illegal here, the arrangement's terms might not allow the couple to refuse the baby once born. The surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014could be a breach of the agreement, especially if such behavior was prohibited. That might affect the couple's options legally.\n\nEthically, the couple is struggling with their readiness to care for a child with special needs. They feel they weren't prepared for that, which is a personal choice. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. She was entrusted with carrying their child, and her substance use might have impacted the baby's health. The couple might argue that her actions contributed to the situation, but does that absolve them of responsibility?\n\nThe couple's main concern is about their ability to care for a child with disabilities. That's a personal decision, but it's also important to consider their obligations under the surrogacy agreement. They haven't reported the surrogate yet, which could be out of fear or uncertainty. But if the agreement allows termination or if there are legal consequences for the surrogate's actions, they might have options.\n\nThe author's stance is that they might be the \"assholes\" for not wanting the baby. But they also feel the surrogate acted irresponsibly. It's a complex situation where both parties might have some fault. The couple might not be in the wrong if their contract allows termination and they can legally proceed. However, if they proceed without considering the surrogate's well-being or the child's rights, they could be seen as insensitive.\n\nIn many surrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, the intended parents can't simply walk away if the child has disabilities. The focus is on the child's best interest. However, the surrogate's substance use could be a separate legal issue. The couple might need to report that to protect the child, even if it complicates their own situation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the legal terms of the agreement and the ethical responsibility towards the child. If the couple can legally refuse the child due to the surrogate's breach, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're using the disabilities as an excuse to abandon the child, that's more problematic. The question is whether their refusal is based on the surrogate's actions or their own inability to care for a child with disabilities.\n"
