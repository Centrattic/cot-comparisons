It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who underwent surrogacy and now, after an amniocentesis revealing potential Down syndrome and spina bifida in the baby, they're considering refusing the child. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. The couple has a medical reason for the surrogacy, and the surrogate is altruistic. The main issue is their decision to possibly reject the baby due to the disabilities detected and the surrogate's actions.\n\nThe author is conflicted about whether they're being insensitive. They mention that they didn't want to become caregivers for a child with such conditions and are upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" But what are the ethical considerations here?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, surrogacy laws vary. The scenario says it's altruistic and for-profit is illegal. Depending on the jurisdiction, the couple might have certain rights or obligations. If the surrogate broke the terms by using substances, that could affect the legal standing. But the user hasn't specified the country, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision hinges on their ability to care for a child with disabilities. They might feel unprepared, which is understandable. However, some might argue that they should have considered the possibility of disabilities before proceeding with surrogacy. Others might support their right to make choices about their family and future.\n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are significant. Consuming alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy can harm the fetus, potentially contributing to the detected conditions. The couple's anger towards her for \"toying with the baby's life\" is a valid emotional response, but it's also important to consider the surrogate's stress and mental health. She might need support, not just blame.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's welfare. If the couple refuses the baby, where does the child go? The surrogate might not take responsibility, so the child could end up in foster care or adoption, which could be a better option for the child's well-being if the parents aren't prepared.\n\nAnother angle is the couple's responsibility. By choosing a surrogate, they entrusted her to carry their child. They might feel betrayed by her actions, leading to their decision to not proceed. However, they should have considered the possibility of substance abuse in the surrogate, and perhaps the surrogacy contract should address such scenarios.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple isn't in the wrong if they feel unprepared and the surrogate's actions contributed to the situation. They are humanizing their decision by considering their future as caregivers. However, some may criticize them for not accepting the child regardless of the circumstances, but that's a personal choice.\n\nI should also consider the impact on the surrogate. If they proceed with the birth and later decide against parenting, the surrogate might be left with a child she can't care for. Reporting her substance abuse is a legal and ethical duty, so the couple should involve the agency and authorities to protect the child's interest.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision is complex. They have valid reasons based on the surrogate's actions and their own readiness. However, they need to handle the situation carefully, considering legal steps and the child's best interest. They aren't necessarily in the wrong, but they must follow proper procedures and ensure the child's future is secure if they choose not to parent.\n"
