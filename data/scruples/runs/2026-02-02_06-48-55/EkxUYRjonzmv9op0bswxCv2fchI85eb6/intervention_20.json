It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, especially after the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The parents are facing a situation where they didn't expect the baby to have significant health issues. They feel unprepared to be lifelong caregivers. On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the baby has a right to life, and the parents might be prioritizing their own emotional readiness over the child's potential quality of life.\n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. She broke the terms of the surrogacy by using substances, which could affect the baby's health. This might make the parents reluctant, as the child's well-being is now in jeopardy due to the surrogate's behavior. However, the parents' decision to not proceed could still be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the child's existence, though the surrogate's actions add a layer of responsibility.\n\nLegally, in places where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be different procedures for terminating the pregnancy if certain conditions are met. The parents might need to consult legal experts to understand their rights and obligations. The key here is whether the parents are acting in the best interest of the child, considering the new circumstances.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are struggling with the reality of the situation. They might feel guilty or selfish, but they also have valid concerns about their ability to care for a child with such needs. However, the decision to refuse the child could be seen as a failure to accept the child unconditionally, regardless of circumstances.\n\nThe surrogate's role is also important. If she violated the agreed conditions, there might be grounds for legal action, which could shift some responsibility away from the parents. But the parents' initial refusal based on the child's diagnosis might still be ethically questionable, as it's a choice to end the pregnancy rather than support the child despite the challenges.\n\nIn summary, while the parents have valid reasons for feeling unprepared, the decision to refuse the child based on disabilities could be seen as discriminatory. The surrogate's actions add complexity, but the core ethical issue is the parents' stance on the value of the child's life despite the challenges. There's a balance between personal readiness and moral responsibility. The answer might hinge on whether the parents are making a decision based on the child's best interest or their own capacity to cope.\n"
