It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, but she's been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The parents found out the baby might have Down Syndrome and spina bifida, and they're considering not taking the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogate is acting altruistically, so there might not be strict legal contracts. If the surrogate is using substances, that's a problem for the child's health. The parents now face a situation where the child might have disabilities they aren't prepared for. \n\nOn one hand, the parents have a right to consider their capabilities and readiness for raising a child with special needs. They might feel overwhelmed by the potential lifelong caregiving required. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the child's condition, which adds to the parents' stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the child isn't at fault. The parents made the choice to proceed with surrogacy despite knowing the risks. The surrogate's behavior while pregnant could be a breach of the agreed-upon terms of the surrogacy arrangement. However, the parents are now considering refusing the child, which raises ethical questions about responsibility and commitment once the pregnancy is underway. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If they refuse the baby, what happens to the child? Are there legal options to terminate the pregnancy, or is it too late? The surrogate's well-being and possible legal repercussions for her actions also need to be considered. \n\nThe parents' decision might be seen as prioritizing their own readiness over the child's needs, which could be viewed as selfish. But they might also be making a realistic assessment of their ability to provide adequate care. \n\nEthically, there's a debate between the right to choose and the responsibility once a child is born. Since the child is biologically theirs, they have a connection, but the surrogate's role complicates things. \n\nI think the key points are: the surrogate violated the terms by substance use, the parents didn't expect this scenario, and their decision is based on their readiness. Legally, if the surrogate was supposed to act in the best interest of the child, her actions might have invalidated the arrangement. However, the parents' refusal could still be seen as abandoning a child they helped create. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the parents are in a complex situation. They might not be entirely in the wrong because the surrogate's actions contributed significantly to the child's condition. But their refusal to accept the child could be seen as abandoning a responsibility they undertook. However, given the circumstances, maybe their decision is more about realistic assessment than selfishness. \n\nBut maybe the answer depends on whether they have a legal right to refuse, which isn't clear here. If they can't legally terminate the pregnancy, they might have to proceed, but if they can, then their decision to do so might be justified. However, the question is about moral wrongness, not legal. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The parents are making a difficult choice based on their capabilities and the surrogate's actions. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but they also have responsibilities. However, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong because the surrogate's actions were a significant factor, and they have the right to consider their own preparedness.\n"
