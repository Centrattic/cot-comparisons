It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking, which is concerning. The author is considering not taking the child, but is this the right decision?\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal where they are, so it's altruistic. In such cases, the legal rights and responsibilities might be different. Depending on the country or state laws, the intended parents might still have the right to make decisions, but surrogacy agreements can vary. If the surrogate is acting altruistically, there might be more flexibility in terms of the parents' decisions. But the surrogate is also a person with her own actions, so if she's violated medical advice by using substances, that's a problem.\n\nEthically, there's a lot to unpack. The intended parents are facing a situation where they're not prepared for disabilities they didn't anticipate. They feel that their lives would fundamentally change, and they're not ready to be caregivers. On one hand, choosing not to parent a child with disabilities can be seen as selfish or discriminatory. On the other hand, the parents have the right to make decisions about their family and their ability to care for a child. The surrogate's behavior adds another layer\u2014she's endangered the pregnancy by her actions, which could affect the child's health further.\n\nThe surrogate's actions: she's admitted to smoking and drinking, which are known to be harmful during pregnancy. That complicates things because her actions might have increased the child's risks. The intended parents are upset because she's \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" Legally, the surrogate might still have rights, especially if the surrogacy agreement is not clear. In some places, even with altruistic arrangements, the surrogate might have the right to make certain decisions, but if the parents have an agreement that allows termination under certain conditions, that might affect the outcome.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are struggling. They've gone through a long process to get here, and now they're faced with unexpected challenges. They might feel they're not making the right choice, but they're also worried about their ability to care for a child with significant needs. The surrogate is also in a vulnerable position, and breaking down under stress is understandable, but her actions are problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're considering terminating the pregnancy or refusing the child after the surrogate's actions. If the parents had to consider the child's best interest, they might argue that continuing the pregnancy despite the surrogate's harmful behaviors is also not in the child's best interest. However, the decision to not accept the child could lead to the surrogate facing termination, which could have legal and ethical implications. If the parents have the right to make that decision, then perhaps they're not in the wrong. But if the surrogate is legally protected, then the parents might not have that choice.\n\nAlso, the parents' feelings about not wanting to be caregivers for life might be valid, but society often expects parents to accept their child regardless. However, the parents have the right to make choices about their family, even if it's difficult. The surrogate's actions complicate things because she's the one who endangered the pregnancy, which might shift some responsibility away from the parents.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, even with a surrogacy agreement, the intended parents might not have the final say. So the parents need to check their legal options. If they can legally terminate the pregnancy or refuse the child, then their decision might be within bounds. However, if they can't, they might be forced to go through with it, which could lead to ethical dilemmas.\n\nIn summary, the parents are in a very complex situation. The surrogate's actions are a significant factor, as she's endangered the child's health. The parents have the right to consider their ability to care for the child, but they also have a responsibility to consider the child's well-being. Depending on the legal framework, their decision might be justified or not. Ethically, it's a tough call, but if the parents have the legal right and the surrogate's actions have contributed to the child's risks, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
