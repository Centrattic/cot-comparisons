It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife has medical issues preventing her from carrying a pregnancy. They found a surrogate through an altruistic agency. Now, the surrogate is five months pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe couple is considering not taking the baby because they feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such conditions. They also mention feeling upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" The question is whether their decision is wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? Let's consider the ethical aspects. Surrogacy agreements\u2014especially altruistic ones\u2014usually outline the legal and ethical responsibilities of all parties. If the surrogate agreed to carry the child and then acted in ways that could harm the baby (like substance abuse), that's a breach of trust and possibly the agreement. The couple might have grounds to terminate the arrangement if the surrogate's actions endangered the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple's decision to back out because of the baby's potential disabilities raises ethical concerns. Choosing not to parent a child because of a disability can be seen as discriminatory, as it's based on the child's inherent characteristics. However, the couple is also within their rights to consider their ability and willingness to provide care, especially if they feel unprepared for the challenges.\n\nAnother angle is the surrogate's actions. If she was aware of the risks of her behavior during pregnancy and still engaged in harmful activities, that's a serious issue. The couple's concern about her responsibility is valid. But the surrogate might have her own struggles, like the stress mentioned, which complicates things. Still, she's responsible for her actions during the pregnancy.\n\nLegally, depending on the surrogacy laws in their country, the couple might have options to terminate the surrogacy arrangement if the surrogate violated the terms. They might need to report the substance use to the agency and possibly the authorities, but this could lead to the termination of the pregnancy if the agency deems it in the child's best interest.\n\nEthically, the couple's stance on the child's disabilities is tricky. While they have the right to make choices about their family, rejecting a child solely because of Down syndrome and spina bifida could be seen as valuing the child less for who they are. However, they also have the right to consider their capacity to parent such a child.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision might be legally justified due to the surrogate's misconduct and the potential risks to the child. Ethically, there's a debate on whether rejecting a child based on disabilities is wrong. However, given the surrogate's breach and the couple's genuine concerns about their ability to care for the child, their position might not be entirely in the wrong. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the surrogate's actions need to be addressed appropriately.\n"
