It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate is using drugs and alcohol, and the parents are considering refusing the child due to the baby possibly having Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. Surrogacy is altruistic in their country, so it's not for profit. The surrogate is now five months pregnant. They had an amniocentesis that showed a high risk of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate revealed she's been drinking and smoking, which are harmful during pregnancy.\n\nThe parents are now considering not accepting the child, feeling they aren't ready for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with special needs. They're also upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" The question is whether the parents are in the wrong here.\n\nI need to consider ethical angles. On one hand, the surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could be seen as harmful, but she's also under stress and broke down in tears. The parents might feel betrayed because she didn't disclose this before. On the other hand, the parents are making a decision based on their own ability to handle a child with special needs. They might not be in the wrong for reevaluating their readiness, especially since they weren't informed of the surrogate's harmful habits. \n\nLegally, since it's altruistic surrogacy, there might be specific laws about termination or what the intended parents can do if issues arise. But the user hasn't provided legal details, so I have to focus on ethics. The parents are facing a tough situation where their expectations (maybe) didn't align with reality. However, they're also considering the child's welfare and their own capacity. \n\nThe surrogate's actions are problematic, but does that absolve the parents of any wrongdoing? They might be in the right because they weren't the ones causing harm. However, if they proceed to terminate or abandon the child, that could be seen as unethical. Alternatively, if they continue, they might be taking on a responsibility they're not sure about. \n\nI think the key here is the surrogate's violation of the agreement by using harmful substances. If the surrogacy contract had specific terms about such behavior, the parents might have legal grounds. Ethically, the parents are in a tough spot, but they might not be in the wrong if they decide to proceed with care, given the surrogate's actions. However, if they choose to terminate based on the child's potential disabilities, that's more complex. But the main issue here is the surrogate's actions, not the parents' initial desire for a child without disabilities. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the parents aren't in the wrong because they're reacting to a situation created by the surrogate's actions and their own limitations. They're not choosing to harm the child but are reevaluating their readiness in light of new information. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
