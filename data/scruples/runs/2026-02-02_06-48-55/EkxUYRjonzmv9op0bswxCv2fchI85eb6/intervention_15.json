It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The couple tried for years to have a child, and due to the wife's medical conditions, they went through surrogacy. The surrogate is 5 months pregnant, and the baby is biologically theirs. Now, they had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. The surrogate revealed she's been smoking and drinking, which is concerning.\n\nThe couple is worried about being caregivers for a child with these conditions and not being ready for that. They also feel upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\" The question is whether they are in the wrong for refusing the child now.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects of surrogacy, especially since it's altruistic and not for profit. In many jurisdictions, the legal framework around surrogacy agreements is strict. If the agreement was made before the pregnancy, the couple might be obligated to take the child, unless there are specific clauses allowing termination in certain circumstances. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the agreement if such things were prohibited. But the couple is now facing the possibility of a child with disabilities, which is a different issue.\n\nEthically, the couple's feelings are about being unprepared for the significant life changes that come with caring for a child with Down Syndrome or spina bifida. While it's valid to feel overwhelmed, the question is whether their decision to refuse the child is morally wrong. On one hand, they might be considering their ability to care for the child. On the other hand, it could be seen as abandoning the child based on its potential disabilities, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are definitely problematic. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy can harm the fetus, and if the surrogacy contract had rules against that, the couple might have grounds to take action. However, the couple's primary reason for not wanting the child is the disabilities found in the amniocentesis. That's where the moral question lies. Some might argue that they should accept the child despite the challenges, while others might say that it's their right to make that decision, especially if the surrogate violated the terms of the agreement.\n\nBut the couple is also considering the surrogate's well-being and the child's future. They might be thinking about the best interests of the child, though that's a complex argument. If they proceed with the pregnancy, the child would need a home. If they don't take the child, the surrogate might give birth and then face the situation of the couple not accepting the child, which could lead to legal issues about custody.\n\nIn many altruistic surrogacy cases, the intended parents are still responsible for the child, even if unexpected issues arise. However, if the surrogate's behavior during pregnancy caused the child's conditions (like spina bifida can be linked to alcohol or smoking), that adds another layer. The couple might feel the surrogate's actions led to these complications, which could affect their decision.\n\nSo, the couple's dilemma is between their unpreparedness for the child's needs and the surrogate's breach of conduct. But if they can't legally terminate the pregnancy now, refusing the child might leave them with no legal option to care for it. The surrogate might be expected to carry through, but then the couple is responsible for the child. In that case, not accepting the child could abandon it in a legal limbo, especially if the surrogate isn't willing to keep it herself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can work with the agency and the surrogate to find an alternative, like adoption, but the question is about their responsibility. If they are the biological parents, even with the child's disabilities, they might still have a legal duty to care for it. The surrogate's actions might be a separate issue, but the couple's decision to refuse the baby because of the disabilities is the main point of contention here.\n\nI think the key here is the intention and the context. The couple didn't know about the conditions and the surrogate's behavior when they entered the surrogacy agreement. The fact that the surrogate broke the terms by smoking and drinking could be a factor in the legal outcome, but the couple's refusal based on the child's potential disabilities might be seen as discriminatory or as failing to follow through on their commitment. However, it's also a personal choice about their ability to care for a child with such needs. But since the surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the couple might not have the legal right to back out, even if the surrogate acted irresponsibly. \n\nSo, if they can't refuse the child legally, then their consideration is understandable in terms of preparedness, but the refusal itself could be in the wrong, especially if they are the legal parents. If they do have the legal right to refuse, maybe due to the surrogate's misconduct, then it's a different scenario. However, the user's question is about whether they are in the wrong now, considering the situation as presented. The user might not have mentioned the legal terms, so I have to assume the typical altruistic surrogacy framework where the intended parents are legally responsible. In that case, refusing the child might be considered wrong, as they have a legal and ethical duty to care for the child, regardless of the child's condition. The surrogate's actions could be a separate issue that might require legal action against her, but the couple's refusal of the child is the main issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they are the ones who committed to the surrogacy and now are considering backtracking due to the child's disabilities. However, if the child's conditions are partly due to the surrogate's actions, that could mitigate some of their responsibility. But I think the core of the problem is the refusal based on the child's health, which is a matter of personal choice versus societal or ethical expectations.\n"
