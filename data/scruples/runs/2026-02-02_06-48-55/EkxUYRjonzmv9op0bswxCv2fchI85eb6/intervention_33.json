It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, not for profit. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the legal angle. Since it's altruistic surrogacy, the laws might differ, but generally, surrogacy agreements can vary. However, once the pregnancy is underway, the legal rights and options might be limited. The couple's right to refuse the child after birth could be a gray area, depending on the jurisdiction. But even if legally possible, it's ethically complex.\n\nEthically, the couple's reasons are about their readiness to care for a child with disabilities. They mention it would change their lives fundamentally. But is that a valid reason? People often make choices based on their personal capacity, but using the child's disabilities as a reason can be seen as discriminatory. It's important to consider the child's right to life and the surrogate's responsibility. The surrogate breaking the agreement by drinking and smoking is a red flag. She might have known the risks but still proceeded, which complicates things. The couple might feel they were set up for a situation they didn't consent to, given the surrogate's behavior. However, the couple's primary responsibility is to the child they intended to have. If they proceed, they might face challenges, but if they refuse, the child could end up in foster care or adoption. The couple's potential insensitivity to the disability is a concern. They might be seen as valuing a \"perfect\" child over one with disabilities. But the surrogate's actions also breach the trust of the surrogacy agreement. The couple's dilemma is tough. They might not be in the wrong for reassessing their readiness, but their decision to potentially abandon the child because of disabilities could be seen as unethical. The key is whether their decision is based on the child's best interest or their own fears. If they choose to go through with the pregnancy but then give the child up for adoption, that's a different scenario than terminating or refusing to take the child. The author's frustration is understandable, but their reasoning might be selfish. They have a right to their decision, but it's a moral gray area. The surrogate's actions also contribute to the problem, so the responsibility isn't solely on the couple. Still, the couple's primary duty is to the child they intended to parent. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice, but it's a close call. However, some might argue they're in the wrong for not accepting the child regardless of disability. The surrogate's actions are separate, but the couple's decision to continue the pregnancy despite the risks is their own. The final answer might be B.\n"
