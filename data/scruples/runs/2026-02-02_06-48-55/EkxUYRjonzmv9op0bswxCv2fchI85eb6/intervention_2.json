It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and after an amniocentesis, they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and are confused about their options and whether they're the bad ones here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal there, so it's altruistic. That probably means the surrogate isn't being paid, which might affect legal rights. In many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, can be legally tricky. If the couple wants to refuse the child now, they might need to go through legal channels. But since they haven't reported the surrogate's substance abuse yet, maybe there's a legal step they need to take. However, the question is about whether they're morally or ethically in the wrong, not just legally.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision hinges on several factors. They had the baby through surrogacy to overcome the wife's medical issues. Now, they discover the surrogate broke their agreement by using substances during pregnancy. That's a significant breach of trust. The surrogate's actions could have endangered the baby's health, which adds another layer. The couple might feel they were betrayed, which complicates their decision.\n\nOn one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. They might not feel they can handle the lifelong care of a child with such needs. On the other hand, they might be seen as using the surrogate's breach as an excuse to terminate the pregnancy, which could be viewed as selfish. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's conditions, but the couple's decision to back out now could be seen as abandoning the child or the surrogate.\n\nThe surrogate's responsibility is also a factor. By smoking and drinking, she violated the expectations of the surrogacy agreement, which could justify the couple reconsidering their commitment. However, the couple's initial decision to proceed with surrogacy was based on the surrogate carrying their biological child. The discovery of the surrogate's actions might make them feel they were lied to or misled, which could affect their moral obligation.\n\nAnother angle is the best interest of the child. If the baby is born with Down syndrome and spina bifida, the couple needs to provide care, which they might not be prepared for. But if the surrogate's actions contributed to these conditions, the couple might feel the surrogate's negligence is a factor. However, the child's needs still exist regardless of how they came to be.\n\nIn terms of the surrogate's welfare, she might face legal consequences for her actions, and the couple's decision to refuse the child could leave her in a difficult position. If they proceed with termination, the surrogate might suffer emotionally or physically. But if they take the child, they might resent the surrogate's actions and the situation they're in.\n\nThe key points here are the surrogate's breach of the agreement, the couple's right to their family planning, and the child's rights. The couple might not be in the wrong if the surrogate violated the terms, but if they proceed with termination, others might view it as a failure to uphold their commitment. However, if the surrogate's actions directly led to the child's conditions, the couple has a valid reason to reconsider.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision is influenced by the surrogate's actions. If the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, the couple has grounds to question the arrangement. However, the moral judgment depends on whether the couple's decision is seen as a legitimate response to the surrogate's breach or as an abandonment of their responsibilities. Legally, they might need to follow specific procedures, but ethically, there's a balance between their rights and the child's needs.\n"
