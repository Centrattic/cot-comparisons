It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. The parents found out through an amniocentesis that the baby might have Down Syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate revealed she was smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The post mentions surrogacy is altruistic and illegal for profit. So, they can't pay the surrogate. That might affect legal rights. If the surrogate is breaking terms by using substances, maybe there's a legal recourse. But the parents are now considering refusing the baby. Legally, can they do that? It's unclear without more info, but maybe they can't, which adds to their stress.\n\nEthically, the parents are worried about the child's quality of life and their own capacity to care for a child with such conditions. They didn't expect this and feel unprepared. They also feel upset that the surrogate used substances, which might have contributed to the complications. \n\nBut is it wrong to not want the child? People make choices based on their circumstances. However, the surrogate's actions might have impacted the pregnancy. The parents might argue they have rights, but since surrogacy agreements can be complex, especially in altruistic cases, maybe they don't have a legal option to terminate. \n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are harmful and possibly a breach of the agreement. The parents might feel betrayed, which could influence their decision. However, the main issue is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting the child due to the medical conditions. \n\nSome might argue that having a child with disabilities is a personal choice and that the parents are being selfish. Others might understand their hesitation, especially if they weren't prepared. The surrogate's actions also raise questions about her responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the surrogacy agreement didn't account for medical conditions, maybe they can't refuse the baby. If they can, then their reasons are personal. But given the surrogate's actions, maybe they have grounds to reconsider. However, the parents' decision is based on the child's conditions, which is a sensitive issue. \n\nThe answer might hinge on the legal aspects and the surrogacy agreement's terms. Since the user is asking if they are in the wrong, without legal specifics, it's hard to say. But ethically, it's a gray area. The parents might not be in the wrong if they can legally terminate the arrangement, especially if the surrogate breached terms. If they can't, they might be stuck in a difficult situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (they're not in the wrong) because they're dealing with unexpected circumstances and the surrogate's actions. However, the decision to refuse based on the child's disabilities is controversial. But given the surrogate's behavior, they might have valid concerns.\n"
