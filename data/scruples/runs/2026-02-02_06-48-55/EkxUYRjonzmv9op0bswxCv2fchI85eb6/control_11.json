It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The context is about a couple who went through surrogacy and found out their unborn child has Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to drinking and smoking during pregnancy. They're considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical and legal aspects here. Surrogacy laws can vary, but the user mentioned it's altruistic and illegal for profit in their country. That might affect their rights and obligations. The couple has a right to know the health of their child, and the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could impact the baby's development. But legally, can they terminate the pregnancy or refuse the child now?\n\nThe couple's decision might be seen as selfish because they're considering giving up the child due to disabilities. But they also have the right to make decisions about their family and lifestyle. Down syndrome and spina bifida require significant care, and the couple might feel unprepared. However, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's condition, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the surrogacy agreement is in place, they might have specific terms about terminating the pregnancy or handling such situations. If the surrogate broke the agreement by using drugs and alcohol, the couple might have legal grounds to take action. But if there's no termination clause, they might be stuck with the baby, which could lead to a custody battle.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. People have different views on disability and the right to life. Some might argue that the couple is wrong for not wanting the child, while others understand their concerns about being caregivers. The surrogate's actions might be seen as negligence, which could shift some responsibility there.\n\nAlso, considering the surrogate's mental health\u2014she's under stress and used substances as coping. That might affect how the situation is judged. If she's a close friend or family, the dynamics change compared to a formal agreement.\n\nIn terms of parenting choices, the couple has the right to decide what's best for their family, even if others disagree. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to refuse the child. The surrogate's actions might mitigate some of the blame on the couple, but they still have to consider the child's well-being.\n\nI need to check if there's a legal option to terminate the pregnancy at 5 months. In some places, termination is possible up until certain points. If they can terminate, then it's a choice they make based on their circumstances. If not, they might have to proceed, which complicates things.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The couple's decision isn't necessarily wrong because they have the right to make choices about their family. However, the way they handle the surrogate's actions and the legal implications matters. The surrogate's negligence could be a factor in their decision. But the core of the question is whether the couple is in the wrong. Since they're making a personal choice based on their readiness and the surrogate's actions, I think the answer is B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
