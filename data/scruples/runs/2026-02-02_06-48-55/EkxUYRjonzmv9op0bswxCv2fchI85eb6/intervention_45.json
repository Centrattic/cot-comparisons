It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was found through an agency, and now there are complications. The surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the fetus has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering refusing the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit in their country, the legal framework might be different. Usually, in such cases, the intended parents have legal rights once the pregnancy is established, but if the surrogate's actions (like substance abuse) are harmful, that could complicate things. The surrogate's behavior might be a breach of the agreement, especially if there were terms about avoiding harmful substances.\n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough decision. They might feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. However, the fact that the surrogate broke the terms by using substances could be a separate issue. The couple's hesitation might be understandable given the unexpected challenges, but they might be seen as putting their own desires over the potential child's rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the surrogate's actions are concerning. If she knew the risks of substance abuse during pregnancy and chose to do it anyway, that's a serious issue. The couple might be justified in seeking legal recourse against her for endangering the fetus. But the question is whether the couple is in the wrong for wanting to refuse the baby.\n\nThe couple's main argument is that they weren't prepared for the caregiving required. However, since they chose this path for conception, they might have a responsibility now. But the surrogate's actions could nullify their right to refuse the child. It's possible they could be seen as in the wrong for not considering the possibility of the surrogate's actions, but since the surrogate broke the agreement, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the couple.\n\nIn terms of the child's rights, if the baby is born with disabilities, the couple might not be able to refuse custody legally, depending on the jurisdiction. So their fear of being seen as insensitive might be valid, but their decision could be based on the surrogate's misconduct rather than their own selfishness.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the decision isn't straightforward. However, the key point is the surrogate's breach of the agreement. If the couple can show that the surrogate violated the terms, they might have grounds for terminating the arrangement. But if there's no such legal basis, they might be in the wrong for not accepting the baby, especially if the surrogate's actions were unintentional or if the couple is prioritizing their own fears over the child's needs.\n"
