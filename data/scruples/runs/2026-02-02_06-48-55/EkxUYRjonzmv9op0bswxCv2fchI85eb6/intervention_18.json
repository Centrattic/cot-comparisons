It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the couple finds out the baby might have Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. They're considering not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic in their country, the legal framework might influence their options. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, which might give the couple grounds to reconsider. However, the surrogate's mental health is also a factor\u2014she mentioned stress and using these as coping mechanisms. There's a balance between accountability and compassion here.\n\nNext, the couple's reasons for not wanting the child are based on the potential challenges of raising a child with disabilities. They feel unprepared for the lifelong caregiving. It's important to recognize that while their feelings are valid, deciding not to take the child based on disability can be seen as discriminatory. Also, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's health issues, but that doesn't absolve the couple of their responsibility.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the couple has the right to walk away due to the surrogate's misconduct and the baby's potential disabilities. If the surrogacy agreement didn't address such scenarios, the couple might be legally bound. However, if the surrogate violated terms by substance use, the couple could have legal options. Emotionally, the surrogate's breakdown adds complexity\u2014she's also a person in distress.\n\nI need to consider if the couple's decision is solely about the surrogate's actions or their own inability to cope with the child's needs. Even if the surrogate was perfect, the couple's hesitation about Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida might still be an issue. This touches on broader societal attitudes towards disability and reproductive choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the couple's decision is influenced by both the surrogate's misconduct and their own readiness. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the legal terms of their surrogacy and the ethical stance on disability. If the surrogate's actions were a violation, the couple isn't in the wrong. But if their decision is primarily due to the child's potential disabilities, that's a more complex ethical issue. Given the surrogate's breach, perhaps the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
