It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife has health issues. The surrogate is pregnant with their genetic child, and they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now they're considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple is considering not taking the child, which could lead to the surrogate possibly carrying the baby to term and maybe giving it up for adoption. But in some places, surrogacy agreements might have legal implications. The surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) could affect the baby's health, but they already did that, so maybe the couple is angry about that.\n\nThe couple's main argument is that they didn't anticipate the health issues and aren't ready for the long-term care. They mention that having a child with such conditions would change their lives fundamentally. So, they might feel it's in their right to not proceed if the circumstances are unexpected. However, some people might argue that once they've agreed to surrogacy, they have a responsibility regardless of unforeseen medical issues.\n\nThen there's the surrogate's actions. She broke the surrogacy rules by using substances, which could affect the baby. But she was under stress. The couple might feel she's responsible for the current situation, which adds to their decision. But does that absolve them of responsibility? Maybe not. They still have to deal with the consequences of their decision, like the surrogate's well-being and the child's future.\n\nLegally, in countries where surrogacy is altruistic, the couple might not have the legal right to terminate the pregnancy at this stage. The surrogate, as the legal mother until birth, might have her own rights. So, there's a legal gray area. If they terminate, maybe the surrogate could push to keep the baby. If they continue, maybe they have to take the child regardless. The couple might be in legal trouble if they don't follow the agreed terms.\n\nEthically, some might say they're not in the wrong because they didn't know about the conditions beforehand, and the surrogate's behavior added to the problem. Others might say they're responsible for the child's well-being regardless. Also, the idea of \"not being ready\" for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities could be seen as selfish. But they also have the right to make decisions about their family's future.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong for changing their minds. The key points are the surrogate's actions and the unexpected medical issues. If the surrogacy contract didn't account for these variables, the couple's decision might be more understandable. However, they also have a duty to the child's welfare. If they refuse the child, the surrogate might have to care for it, which could be challenging for her too.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might depend on the legal framework and the ethics of choice versus responsibility. But in terms of right or wrong, there's no clear answer. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the surrogacy agreement didn't allow for termination at 5 months, their refusal could be against the agreement. Also, the surrogate's actions may have contributed to the child's condition, but the couple still might be seen as abandoning the child. It's a complex situation, but from a strict standpoint, they might not be in the wrong because the circumstances were unexpected and the surrogate's behavior was a factor. Alternatively, they could be seen as not upholding their commitment. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the situation is unprecedented and the surrogate's actions complicated things, but it's a close call. The answer would be B (No).\n"
