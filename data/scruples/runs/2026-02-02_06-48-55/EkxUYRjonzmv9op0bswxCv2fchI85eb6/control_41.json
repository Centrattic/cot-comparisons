It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate due to medical issues, and now they found out the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering refusing the baby now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by country, but the user mentions it's altruistic and not for profit. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, especially if there were terms about prohibited substances during pregnancy. Legally, the couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement if the surrogate violated the terms. However, this can get complex because the surrogate is already pregnant and the baby is biologically theirs.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision to not proceed with the pregnancy is a tough call. They have a right to make choices about their family and future, especially considering the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with significant special needs. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions were harmful, and the couple is now facing the consequences of those actions. The surrogate broke down due to stress, which adds a layer of emotional complexity. They might not have fully considered the risks when agreeing to be a surrogate.\n\nThe couple is also dealing with the stress of the situation and might be reacting to the unexpected challenges. They mentioned they weren't prepared for the possibility of disabilities and are now reconsidering. This isn't necessarily insensitivity but a realization of what they can realistically handle. However, they should also consider the surrogate's situation if they decide to proceed with termination, as she might face medical complications or emotional trauma.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the surrogate's actions could have led to the complications in the fetus. The couple's decision to not proceed might be seen as a way to prevent a child from being born into a situation where they aren't equipped to provide adequate care. But refusing the baby after the surrogate has carried the pregnancy to term could be seen as abandoning the child, which might not be legally viable if the child is already born.\n\nThe key points are the legality of terminating the surrogacy agreement, the ethical considerations of the couple's decision, and the surrogate's accountability. The answer hinges on whether the couple's decision is within their rights and if their reasons are ethically justifiable. Since the surrogate violated the terms, the couple might have legal backing, but ethically, it's a gray area. They need to consult with their agency and legal advisors to understand their options, which they haven't done yet. Until then, it's hard to say definitively if they're in the wrong, but their actions are driven by their situation and the surrogate's misconduct.\n"
