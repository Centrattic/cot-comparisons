It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who are using a surrogate for their child because the wife has medical issues. The surrogate is pregnant, and there's an amniocentesis that shows the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Now, the surrogate admits to smoking and drinking, which complicates things. The couple is considering not taking the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The surrogate is supposed to be altruistic, not for profit. The couple is worried about the life changes if they take a child with disabilities. But is that a valid reason to refuse the baby now? There's also the issue of the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking, which can harm the baby. But she's been under stress and used these as coping mechanisms. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, they might have a contract, but since it's altruistic, maybe the terms aren't as clear. The couple might have the right to consider their options if the surrogate isn't following the agreed-upon terms, like avoiding harmful substances. However, the surrogate is also a person with her own struggles. \n\nEthically, the couple is conflicted between their own preparedness for a child with disabilities and the surrogate's actions. The key points here are: 1) The surrogate's behavior that could harm the baby, 2) The couple's decision to potentially not take the child, and 3) Their underlying reasons for not wanting to care for a child with disabilities.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong for considering not taking the baby. If the surrogate's actions were a breach of their agreement, the couple might have a right to reconsider. However, the couple's primary reason for not wanting the baby is the potential disabilities, which could be seen as selfish or discriminatory. But they also mention they weren't prepared for that life change.\n\nThere's also the surrogate's well-being and the child's future. If they proceed, the child could be born with issues caused by the surrogate's substance use. If they terminate, the surrogate might be affected emotionally. But the couple's main issue is the child's conditions, not the surrogate's actions. \n\nSo, the couple's main problem is their stance on the child's disabilities. Choosing not to take the baby because of that could be seen as wrong, as it's a form of ableism. However, if the surrogate violated the terms by using substances, maybe that's a separate issue. But the couple's primary reason seems to be the disabilities, which is more ethically problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the child's needs and the surrogate's responsibility. But I need to check if the surrogate's actions are a mitigating factor here. If the couple can argue that the surrogate's behavior affects the child's health, maybe that's a reason. But the main issue is their own decision based on the disabilities. So, likely, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because of the underlying reason being the child's potential disabilities, which is a sensitive ethical issue."
