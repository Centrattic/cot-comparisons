It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the couple is going through surrogacy because the wife has PCOS and endometriosis. They found an altruistic surrogate, and the surrogate is five months pregnant. Now, they had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure about their options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Since surrogacy is altruistic and for profit is illegal in their country, the legal framework might be different from commercial arrangements. Altruistic surrogacy often involves more personal and emotional bonds, which could complicate things. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have legal implications, especially if it's determined that she endangered the fetus. However, in many places, a surrogate's rights versus the intended parents' rights can vary. \n\nEthically, the couple is facing a dilemma between their preparedness for a child with significant needs and the surrogate's well-being. They mention that they weren't prepared for the possibility of Down syndrome or spina bifida, which they feel would change their lives into caregivers. They also express frustration that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them,\" which suggests they feel the surrogate's actions were negligent.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the couple's right to terminate the pregnancy given the new information, the surrogate's breach of expectations by substance use, and the moral responsibility of the couple. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, once a pregnancy is well into the second trimester, termination for non-medical reasons might be restricted. However, if the surrogate's actions have endangered the child, there could be legal grounds for termination. The couple might also have grounds to question the surrogate's suitability if she misrepresented her health habits during the selection process. \n\nBut ethically, the couple is in a tough spot. They might feel they are in the wrong because they didn't anticipate this scenario, but they are also facing a life-changing situation. The surrogate's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, which might shift some responsibility from the couple. However, the couple's decision to proceed or terminate could be viewed differently based on cultural and personal values. \n\nLegal complexities aside, the couple's emotional state is valid; they are not prepared for the challenges of raising a child with those conditions. The surrogate's actions complicate matters further. If the surrogate was aware of the risks and still engaged in harmful behaviors, that could affect the couple's moral culpability. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if they decide to terminate the pregnancy due to the surrogate's negligence and their own lack of preparedness, some might argue they are prioritizing their own interests over the child's life. Others might see it as a responsible decision given the circumstances. \n\nBut considering the surrogate's actions were a breach of the agreed-upon health responsibilities, the couple might have a stronger ethical stance in deciding to not proceed. However, the act of refusing the child after the surrogate has carried the pregnancy for five months might still be seen as callous by some. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The couple's decision is influenced by both the surrogate's actions and their own unpreparedness. Legally and ethically, there's no clear-cut answer, but the author might not be in the wrong given the surrogate's role in endangering the pregnancy and their own right to choose their parenting path.\n"
