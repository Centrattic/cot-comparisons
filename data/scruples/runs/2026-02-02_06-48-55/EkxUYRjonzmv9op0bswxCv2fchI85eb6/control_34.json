It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated with surrogacy, medical issues, and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the couple went through a lot to have a child because of the wife's medical conditions. They found a surrogate in a country where it's altruistic, not for profit. Now, the surrogate is five months pregnant, but the amniocentesis results show a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. The question is whether they are in the wrong for that. From a legal standpoint, in many places, especially where surrogacy is altruistic, there might be agreements in place. But if the surrogate is breaking the terms by using substances, maybe there are legal options. However, the couple is unsure and hasn't reported it yet.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The couple didn't anticipate the medical conditions and feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with such needs. They also feel the surrogate was irresponsible. But is it wrong to back out now? On one hand, they made a commitment to have the child through surrogacy, but on the other, they have new information that drastically changes their life plan. The surrogate's actions also complicate things.\n\nIn surrogacy agreements, typically the intended parents have the right to make decisions regarding the pregnancy, but this can vary by jurisdiction. If the surrogate was supposed to avoid certain behaviors, their actions might void the agreement. The couple might have legal recourse, but the emotional and ethical aspects are complex. They might be seen as abandoning a child, but they also have their own well-being and preparedness to consider.\n\nThe author's main concerns are their lack of readiness and the surrogate's behavior. They might not be in the wrong legally if their surrogacy contract allows termination under such circumstances, but ethically, it's debatable. However, the key here is that the surrogate's actions were a breach, which could be a significant factor. The answer might hinge on whether the couple can legally and ethically back out given the surrogate's misconduct and the new medical information. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, considering all factors, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because they're dealing with unexpected circumstances and the surrogate's actions may have violated their agreement.\n"
