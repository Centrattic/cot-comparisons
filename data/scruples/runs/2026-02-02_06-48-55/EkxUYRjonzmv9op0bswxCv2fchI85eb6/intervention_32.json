It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a surrogate, who has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering refusing the child now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the country described, surrogacy is altruistic, so there's no financial transaction. The key issue here is the surrogate's behavior\u2014smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Those are harmful and could affect the baby's health. The couple might feel that the surrogate's actions have jeopardized the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, if the surrogacy agreement doesn't allow termination at this stage, the couple might not have the right to refuse the baby. But ethically, there's the question of whether they have a duty to care for the child despite the circumstances. The couple's concerns about being caregivers for a child with significant needs are valid, but so is the surrogate's responsibility to follow medical advice.\n\nThe surrogate's actions could be seen as negligent. However, she also mentioned stress and coping mechanisms, which might indicate a need for support rather than punishment. The couple's decision to not report the agency yet is understandable as they seek options.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple might feel they are protecting the child by not having a parent who contributed to its health risks. But they could also be seen as abandoning the child because of its disabilities, which raises questions about their responsibility once the child is born.\n\nI need to weigh the surrogate's wrongdoing against the couple's rights. If the surrogacy contract doesn't allow termination, the couple might not be in the wrong for trying to find a solution. However, if the surrogate's actions were a breach of the agreement, the couple might be in a position to seek legal recourse instead of refusing the child. The answer hinges on whether their refusal is a legitimate response to the surrogate's actions or if they are avoiding responsibility for the child's needs.\n"
