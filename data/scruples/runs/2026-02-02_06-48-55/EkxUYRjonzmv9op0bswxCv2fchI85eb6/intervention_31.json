It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the original story is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate's substance use during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical framework here. The surrogacy is altruistic in a place where it's illegal for profit. That might affect the legal rights and obligations of the parties involved. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which could impact the baby's health but she's also under stress. \n\nThe parents are struggling with the idea of raising a child with significant needs. They feel unprepared and are considering not taking the child. The question is whether they're in the wrong for that. \n\nEthically, there's a lot to consider. The parents have a right to make decisions about their family, but the child's rights and the surrogate's responsibilities come into play. The parents might be seen as making a selfish choice by not wanting the child, but they also might be realistically assessing their ability to care for a child with special needs. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (substance use) are problematic and could be a point of legal or ethical violation, depending on the surrogacy agreement. If the parents can prove that the surrogate's behavior endangered the child, they might have grounds to terminate the arrangement. However, if they terminate without considering the surrogate's well-being or the child's rights, they could be seen as in the wrong. \n\nIt's also important to consider the emotional and psychological impact on the surrogate and the potential child. The parents might be acting out of fear or lack of preparation, which doesn't necessarily make them wrong, but it's crucial to explore all options, like seeking support for raising a child with disabilities. \n\nThe parents haven't reported the surrogate yet, so the situation is still fluid. They might need to consult legal experts to understand their rights and the surrogate's. The answer hinges on whether their decision is based on valid reasons (like the surrogate's actions) or just the child's disabilities. If it's the latter, they might be in the wrong. If it's the former, it's more complex. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents can't legally refuse a child once born, especially if it's their biological child. So the parents might have no choice but to take the child, which complicates their decision. The ethical dilemma here is balancing their own expectations with the child's right to life and the surrogate's accountability. \n\nOverall, while the parents' decision is understandable due to the unexpected challenges, they might be in the wrong if they're terminating based solely on the child's disabilities. However, the surrogate's actions could influence the outcome. The answer isn't black and white, but based on the information, the parents' primary reason seems to be the child's conditions, which could make them ethically responsible.\n"
