It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and they found out the baby might have Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which is concerning.\n\nFirst, the couple's main concern is that they didn't plan for a child with disabilities. They feel their lives would drastically change, and they're not ready. The question is whether they're in the wrong for considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. In surrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, what are the rights and responsibilities? If the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, does that give the couple grounds to back out? Also, the health of the baby is a factor. The couple has a right to make decisions about their future, but there's also the moral aspect of the child's well-being.\n\nBut wait, the baby is biologically theirs. If the surrogate was supposed to carry it for them, but she violated terms, maybe the couple can terminate the pregnancy? Or is it too late at 5 months? Legally, in some places, it might not be possible. Also, the couple's hesitation about disabilities\u2014should that factor into their decision? It's their choice, but some might argue that disability doesn't make a life less valuable. However, they're not obligated to have a child if circumstances change.\n\nThe surrogate's actions add another layer. If she was reckless, maybe the couple isn't at fault for reevaluating. But they might still have legal and ethical obligations. The answer might depend on the legal framework of surrogacy where they are. Since it's altruistic and for profit is illegal, maybe the agreement was less formal, making it tricky.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they proceed to terminate, maybe others would criticize them for not accepting the child regardless of disabilities. But if the surrogate broke the agreement, maybe they have a reason. The answer isn't straightforward. I think it's a gray area. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they decide not to proceed, some might say they're being irresponsible, others might understand their situation. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and the surrogate's actions, but there's a moral debate. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and since they're the intended parents and the surrogate violated terms, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
