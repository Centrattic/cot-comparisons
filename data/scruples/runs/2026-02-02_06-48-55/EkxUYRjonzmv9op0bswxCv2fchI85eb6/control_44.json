It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user and their wife have been trying to conceive for years, and due to medical issues, they went through a surrogacy arrangement. The surrogate is now five months pregnant with their biological child. The amniocentesis results showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Now, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and is unsure if they can refuse it. They're worried about being seen as insensitive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Since surrogacy for profit is illegal in their country, it's altruistic. That might mean there are no strict legal contracts, which complicates things. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, that's a problem. But they haven't reported it yet. The parents might feel they have the right to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is jeopardizing the baby's health. However, the parents also have a responsibility to ensure the child's well-being once born. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The couple didn't anticipate the disabilities and are unprepared for the lifelong caregiving. They mention being scared and not ready. On one hand, they might be making a rational decision based on their ability to provide care. On the other hand, choosing not to have a child with disabilities could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have affected the baby's development further, so they might feel responsible for that.\n\nThe surrogate's emotional state is also a factor. She broke down, indicating stress. The couple might feel they have a right to leave the arrangement if the surrogate is not adhering to medical advice. But what about the surrogate's rights? If they terminate the pregnancy, what happens to her? She might face health risks from termination. Also, is she legally allowed to have an abortion in this situation?\n\nAnother angle: the couple is considering refusing the baby after the surrogate has carried it. If surrogacy is altruistic, maybe the parents are expected to accept the child regardless. But if the surrogate violated the agreement, maybe they can walk away. However, the couple might be in a position where they can't refuse the baby, leading to potential legal battles or ethical dilemmas.\n\nThe couple's fear of being labeled insensitive is valid. Society often stigmatizes those who choose not to have a child with disabilities. But they also have the right to consider their own capacity to care. The key here is whether their decision is based on the baby's best interest or their own fears. If they terminate due to the surrogate's actions, that's one thing; if they terminate solely because of the disabilities, that's another.\n\nI need to check if their actions are based on the surrogate's misconduct or the disabilities. The surrogate's smoking and drinking could be a reason to terminate the pregnancy for the baby's health. The disabilities add another layer. If the couple is terminating because they can't handle the lifelong care, that's more ethically gray. But if the surrogate's actions made the pregnancy more risky, that's a different matter.\n\nIn summary, there's a mix of factors: the surrogate's behavior, the baby's health, and the couple's preparedness. Legally, since it's altruistic, there might be no contract, so their options are limited. Ethically, it's about balancing their rights against the surrogate's and the child's rights. If they proceed, they might face challenges in providing care. If they terminate, they might be seen as abandoning the baby. The answer likely hinges on whether their decision is based on the surrogate's misconduct (which they might have a right to address) versus the disabilities (which could be seen as discriminatory).\n"
