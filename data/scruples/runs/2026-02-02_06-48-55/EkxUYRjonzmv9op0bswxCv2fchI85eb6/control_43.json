It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, but the amniocentesis showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and for profit is illegal, maybe there's an agreement in place. But they haven't reported the surrogate's behavior yet. The surrogate's actions might have affected the baby's health, which could be a legal issue. But the couple is now thinking about refusing the child. \n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough decision. They didn't expect this outcome and feel unprepared for the lifelong care responsibilities. They might feel that the surrogate violated the agreement by using harmful substances. However, the couple also has a responsibility to the child once born. But since the child is biologically theirs, do they have the right to terminate the pregnancy? That's a big question. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, the decision to terminate a pregnancy, especially in the second trimester, is complex. If the pregnancy is already in the second trimester, legal termination might be more restricted. Also, the surrogate's actions could be a separate issue, but the couple's decision to proceed or not is their own, though they have to consider the surrogate's rights and the legal framework of surrogacy agreements.\n\nThe couple's reasons are based on their readiness and the potential impact on their lives. While that's a personal consideration, some might argue that it's selfish, but others might understand their concerns given the circumstances. The surrogate's actions complicate things further because she breached the trust and possibly the agreement, which could affect the couple's decision.\n\nSo, is the couple in the wrong? They are facing a difficult situation where they have to weigh their own preparedness against the child's well-being. Legally and ethically, it's a gray area. They might not be in the wrong for reevaluating their decision given new information, especially the surrogate's actions. However, the decision to refuse the child after this point could be seen as unethical by some, but they might not be in the wrong if they have legal grounds or if the agency allows termination under such circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation is complicated with legal and ethical factors, and their decision is based on unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's breach of agreement.\n"
