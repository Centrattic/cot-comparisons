It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. The couple went through a lot to get here, dealing with infertility issues. Now, the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the ethical considerations. The couple is considering refusing the child. But since they used a surrogate, there might be legal agreements in place. In countries where surrogacy is altruistic, like the UK or Canada, there are strict regulations. The surrogate might have legal parental rights until a court order transfers them. So the couple might not actually have the legal right to refuse the child at this point. That's a big factor.\n\nThen there's the issue of the surrogate's actions. She admitted to smoking and drinking, which are harmful during pregnancy. The couple might feel betrayed because the surrogate's actions could have affected the baby's health. However, the surrogate was also under a lot of stress and broke down. It raises questions about support for the surrogate. Did the couple provide enough support? Were there checks in place for her well-being?\n\nThe couple's reasoning is that having a child with disabilities would fundamentally change their lives, and they're not ready. They didn't want it and feel the surrogate toyed with the child's life. But is it fair to abandon the child because of unforeseen circumstances? The couple might be in a difficult position, but is that a valid reason to walk away? Also, they haven't reported the surrogate's actions yet. If they do, what happens next? The surrogate might face consequences, but the child would still be affected by her actions regardless.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple's decision to not accept the child after the surrogate's behavior could be seen as prioritizing their own expectations over the child's right to be born. However, the couple may not have considered the full implications when they started the surrogacy process. The surrogate's actions, while harmful, might also be a result of lack of support. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the couple is in the wrong for considering refusal. Legally, they might not have the right to do so, especially if the surrogate's parental rights are still in place. Ethically, it's complex. They have a responsibility to the child once it's born, but they're also facing a significant life change. However, the fact that the surrogate broke the terms of the agreement (no alcohol or smoking) could be a point in the couple's favor. Yet, terminating the pregnancy at this stage might not be an option, and they might have to proceed with the birth. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The couple might not be in the wrong for feeling unprepared, but legally and ethically, they may not have the right to refuse the child. The surrogate's actions complicate things, but the couple's decision to walk away could be seen as selfish. However, the initial agreement and legal framework would be key. Since the answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong), the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
