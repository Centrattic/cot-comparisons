It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who used a surrogate because the wife has medical issues. They found out through an amniocentesis that the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now the couple is considering refusing the baby and are unsure if they're the bad guys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The surrogate is supposed to carry the child altruistically, but she broke the agreement by using harmful substances. That's a big deal because it could affect the baby's health. The couple might feel they have the right to terminate or refuse the child if the surrogate didn't follow the agreed terms. However, they also have to think about the child's future and their own readiness to care for a child with special needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple's decision not to proceed could be seen as abandoning a life, especially if the child is viable. But they argue they didn't sign up for this scenario. They might not be at fault for not wanting to take on caregiving responsibilities for a child with significant disabilities. Also, the surrogate's actions were a breach of trust and could have legal implications, depending on local laws.\n\nLegally, even in altruistic surrogacy, there are usually contracts. If the surrogate violated the contract by using drugs or alcohol, the couple might have grounds to terminate the agreement. However, the legality can vary, and they might need legal advice before making a decision. Ethically, it's a tough call. The couple's concerns about their ability to care for the child are valid, but so is the child's right to a life. However, since the child's health is compromised due to the surrogate's actions, the couple might feel less responsible.\n\nAnother angle is the couple's emotional response. They were upfront about their fears and the significant life changes that come with caring for a child with disabilities. It's understandable they feel unprepared. But they also have to consider the surrogate's well-being and the child's future. If they proceed, they might face challenges, but if they don't, the child might end up in another situation.\n\nThe key points here are the surrogate's violation of the agreement and the couple's right to reconsider their decision based on new information. If the surrogate was supposed to follow certain guidelines and didn't, the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong for reassessing. However, the child's best interests should also be considered. If the couple decides not to proceed, the child might be placed for adoption or another arrangement. The couple might not be at fault, but they should handle it responsibly, perhaps with legal guidance to ensure everything is done properly.\n\nIn summary, while the surrogate's actions were a breach, the couple's decision to reconsider their commitment isn't inherently wrong given the circumstances. They have a right to their own decisions about parenting and should not be forced into a situation they didn't agree to. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
