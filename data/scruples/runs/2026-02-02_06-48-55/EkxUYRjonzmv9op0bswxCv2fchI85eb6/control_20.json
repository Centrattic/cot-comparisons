It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby with potential disabilities, given that the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple went through surrogacy because of the wife's medical issues. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the amniocentesis suggests Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to substance abuse. The couple is now questioning if they're in the wrong for not wanting the baby.\n\nThe main points here are the ethical considerations. The couple is worried about being caregivers for a child with disabilities, which they feel unprepared for. They also mention being upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life.\" But the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have contributed to the baby's conditions, though alcohol and smoking are known risk factors for spina bifida and other issues. \n\nLegally, in jurisdictions where surrogacy is purely altruistic, there might be specific laws regarding termination or the rights of the intended parents. If the surrogate's actions were negligent, the couple might have legal recourse, but that's a separate issue from moral responsibility.\n\nEthically, the couple is struggling with the decision to terminate or proceed. They might feel the surrogate's negligence made the situation worse, but they also feel conflicted about their own decision. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to proceed. \n\nArguments against them being in the wrong: They didn't know about the surrogate's behavior beforehand, the baby's conditions were unexpected, and they're making a difficult decision based on their readiness to handle the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. They might not be to blame for their honest feelings about the situation.\n\nArguments for them being in the wrong: Choosing not to proceed after the surrogate has carried the pregnancy as far as 5 months might be seen as abandoning the child. Also, the surrogate's behavior could be a separate issue to address, but the couple's decision might be influenced more by their own fears than the surrogate's actions.\n\nBut the key here is the couple's intent. They didn't want the baby to have disabilities, and now they're faced with a reality they aren't ready for. The surrogate's actions might have contributed, but the couple's decision is more about their own preparedness. They might be in the wrong for not considering the possibility of disabilities before proceeding with surrogacy, but they had no way to know beforehand.\n\nAlternatively, they might not be in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their capacity to care for a child with such needs. It's a tough situation, and people have different views on this. Legally and ethically, it's complex. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about disability and reproductive choices.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong, but given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their circumstances, though the surrogate's actions add a layer of complexity.\n"
