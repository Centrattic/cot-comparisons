It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about surrogacy where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, but she ended up smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The parents found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. They're now considering refusing the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy is illegal for profit where they are, it's purely altruistic. But if the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, maybe there's a legal issue there. However, the question is about morality, not just legality. \n\nThe parents are worried about their lives changing drastically if they have to care for a child with those conditions. They didn't plan for that, and they feel unprepared. But is it right to back out now? On one hand, they might argue they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation. \n\nThe surrogate's behavior\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014could have increased the risk of those birth defects. She was supposed to carry a child for others, and her actions might have compromised the baby's health. But she also mentioned stress as a reason, which complicates things. She might be in a vulnerable position too.\n\nThe parents are now considering refusing the child. But can they? Legally, it's unclear. If surrogacy is altruistic and not legally binding, maybe they can't just back out. Morally, even if they had a contract, is it wrong to abandon the child after agreeing to surrogacy? \n\nAlso, the parents might be feeling responsible for the surrogate's stress. If they contributed to her stress through the process, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the surrogate was supposed to follow medical guidelines. \n\nAnother angle: the child's rights. If the child is born with disabilities, is it ethical to abandon them? But the parents felt they weren't prepared for that responsibility. It's a tough balance between their expectations and the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of judgment, some might say they're selfish for not wanting to care for an impaired child, while others might empathize with their situation. The surrogate's actions might shift some responsibility, but the parents are still the ones making the decision to reject the child. \n\nI think the key factors are the surrogate's breach of the agreement, the parents' right to make decisions about their family, and the child's welfare. Since the surrogate's actions may have led to the issues, maybe the parents aren't entirely at fault. But refusing the child after agreeing to surrogacy could still be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the child is viable. However, given the circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong because they're trying to do what's best for their family. \n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because of the surrogate's actions and their own unpreparedness. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the fact that they're still considering their options and haven't acted yet shows they're not just abandoning the child. They might be in a legal gray area but not morally wrong.\n"
