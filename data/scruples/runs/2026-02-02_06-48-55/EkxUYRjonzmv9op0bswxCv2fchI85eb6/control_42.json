It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate broke her agreement by smoking and drinking, and the parents-to-be are considering backing out after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, the legal framework might be different. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the agreement. Surrogates are usually expected to avoid harmful substances, so this might be a valid reason for the intended parents to reconsider.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the parents' decision. They might feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. But is it valid to walk away because of the potential disabilities? Different people have different perspectives here. Some might say the parents are making a selfish choice, while others might understand their lack of readiness. However, the surrogate's misconduct complicates things because she broke the terms, which could justify the parents' decision.\n\nThe parents are also worried about being insensitive. But they are in a situation where they can't control the outcome of the pregnancy's health issues, but they can control their decision based on the surrogate's actions. The main question is whether the parents are wrong for not wanting the baby anymore. If the surrogate violated the agreement, maybe the parents have grounds to back out. However, if the surrogacy contract doesn't address this, it's tricky. Also, the child's well-being is a factor\u2014would terminating the pregnancy be in the baby's best interest?\n\nI need to check if the parents have legal recourse here. If the surrogate agreed to certain terms (like no alcohol/tobacco) and broke them, the parents might have legal options. If not, then their decision could be seen as abandoning the child, which is ethically wrong. But if they can prove the surrogate's actions endangered the baby, they might have a case.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the parents have a right to make decisions based on their ability to care for the child, especially if the surrogate's actions were negligent. Others might say that regardless of the surrogate's actions, the child has a right to a family. However, the parents aren't rejecting the child due to disabilities but because of the surrogate's behavior and the resulting health issues.\n\nAlso, the parents are in a vulnerable position, facing unexpected challenges. Their honesty about their readiness is important. They might not be the \"assholes\" because they are reacting to a situation that's out of their control, partially caused by the surrogate's actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014surrogate's breach of agreement, the parents' lack of readiness, and the potential legal implications\u2014it's a complex case. The answer might hinge on whether the surrogate's actions were a valid reason to rescind the agreement. If yes, then the parents aren't wrong. If not, they might be. But given the surrogate's misconduct, it's possible the parents aren't in the wrong.\n"
