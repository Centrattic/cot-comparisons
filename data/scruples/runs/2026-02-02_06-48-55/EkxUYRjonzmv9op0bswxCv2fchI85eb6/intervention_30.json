It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who used a surrogate to have a child, but now they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and are unsure if they can refuse it at this point. They\u2019re worried about being seen as insensitive but aren't ready for the lifelong caregiving responsibilities.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The surrogate was found through an altruistic agency since surrogacy for profit is illegal. The couple had tried for years to conceive and went through many medical processes. The surrogate broke down and admitted to substance use, which might have contributed to the baby's conditions. The couple is now considering not taking the child, which raises ethical questions.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects first. If surrogacy is altruistic, there might be legal agreements in place. In many jurisdictions, even in altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents have certain rights, but laws vary. If the surrogate was aware of the risks and agreed to the surrogacy, maybe the couple can legally refuse the child, especially if there's a clause about medical issues. However, if there's no such clause, the surrogate might have legal rights as the birth mother, which complicates things. The couple should consult a legal expert to understand their options.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The couple argues that they didn't anticipate the medical conditions and aren't prepared for the lifelong caregiving commitment. They also mention the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) which might have affected the pregnancy. However, the surrogate was under stress and used these as coping mechanisms. Does that make her actions excusable? It's possible she was in a vulnerable state, but it's also a breach of the surrogacy agreement if such substances were prohibited. The couple might feel they were misled, especially if the agency didn't screen properly for substance use.\n\nBut the couple's main argument is about their readiness. They didn't plan for a child with these needs. On one hand, it's their right to make decisions about their family. On the other hand, the child is now a life that deserves care. If they can't take the child, maybe other options like adoption or foster care exist, but that's another layer of complexity. The surrogate might also have rights here, so terminating the pregnancy isn't an option if the baby is already 5 months along, especially if the surrogate is close to term.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong for not wanting the child. From a legal standpoint, if they have the right to refuse under the agreement, maybe they aren't. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Some might argue they're being selfish, not accepting the child's needs. Others might see them as realistic, acknowledging they can't provide the necessary care. The surrogate's actions add another layer\u2014did she fulfill her responsibilities? If she violated the surrogacy agreement by using substances, that could be a point in the couple's favor. But they also knew the risks of conception and surrogacy; medical outcomes can be unpredictable.\n\nI should also consider the surrogate's well-being. She's already under stress and might face backlash. The couple's decision affects her and the child. If they proceed, they take on a significant role, but if they refuse, the surrogate might have to care for the child alone, which is unfair. However, surrogacy agreements often include provisions for such scenarios. The couple should explore all legal options, including involving the agency and possibly the court.\n\nIn summary, the couple's position isn't straightforward. They might have valid legal grounds if the agreement allows refusal, especially if the surrogate breached her part. Ethically, it's debatable. They're prioritizing their ability to care for a child, which is a valid personal decision, but it's also a hard choice. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, which complicates the moral judgment. The answer hinges on legal rights and the specific terms of the surrogacy agreement. If the law supports the couple's right to refuse, then they aren't in the wrong. If not, they are morally conflicted but legally limited in their options.\n"
