It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has broken the agreement by drinking and smoking, and the intended parents are now considering terminating the pregnancy because the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws can be complex. In some places, especially where it's altruistic, the rights and responsibilities of all parties might be different. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking during pregnancy) could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement. That's a key point. If the agreement prohibits such behavior because it endangers the child, then the intended parents might have legal grounds to terminate the pregnancy or take other actions.\n\nNext, the medical aspect. The parents found out about the potential disabilities through an amniocentesis. They're worried about the lifelong responsibilities of raising a child with these conditions. While that's a personal decision, the question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to proceed. Legally, in many jurisdictions, the intended parents might have the right to terminate if the surrogate's actions compromised the child's health, especially if the surrogacy contract allows for that.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, the surrogate's actions were harmful and possibly illegal if the agreement forbade substance use. On the other hand, the intended parents are making a decision based on the child's potential health issues. However, the parents' decision to refuse the child might be seen as abandoning responsibility, but if the surrogate's actions violated the contract, the parents might have valid reasons.\n\nAlso, the parents haven't reported the surrogate yet, which could indicate they're still considering their options. They might need to consult legal experts to understand their rights. If the surrogate's actions were a breach, the parents might not be in the wrong for seeking termination. However, if the surrogacy contract doesn't address this, it could complicate things.\n\nI should also consider the child's best interest. If the surrogate's behavior has already caused harm, the intended parents might be justified in seeking termination to prevent further harm. But if the termination is solely based on the child's potential disabilities, that could be ethically questionable, but legally, if allowed by the contract, it might be acceptable.\n\nIn summary, the intended parents might not be in the wrong if the surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, and their decision is based on the child's welfare. However, if they're terminating solely because of the disabilities without the surrogate's breach, that's more ethically complex. Given the surrogate's actions, their decision might be legally and ethically justified, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
