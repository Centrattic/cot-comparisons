It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who went through surrogacy, and now they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. They're considering not taking the baby and are unsure if they're the bad guys.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by country, but the scenario mentions it's altruistic and illegal for profit. So maybe there's a legal framework here. The couple might have a right to terminate the pregnancy if they choose, depending on the laws. However, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement. Surrogacy contracts usually include clauses about not using harmful substances. If she violated that, the couple might have legal recourse, which could affect their decision to proceed.\n\nEthically, the couple's reasons for not wanting the baby are complex. They mention being unprepared for the lifelong care a child with those conditions might need. That's a personal and valid concern. But they also express feeling that the surrogate \"toyed with a life,\" which could be seen as judgmental. However, given the surrogate's admission of harmful behavior, maybe their hesitation is justified.\n\nThe surrogate's health choices are a big factor. If she was aware of the risks and her actions could harm the fetus, that complicates her responsibility. The couple might feel they have a right to withdraw, especially if the surrogate's actions compromised the pregnancy. They haven't reported it yet, but they might need to consider the agency's role here. Legally, if the surrogate broke the contract, the couple could have options to terminate the pregnancy, which might be within their rights.\n\nOn the other hand, society sometimes stigmatizes people who choose not to have a child with disabilities. The couple could be seen as selfish, but they're also facing a reality they didn't plan for. It's a tough spot. They might not be the villains here because they're considering their ability to provide for the child's needs. However, their decision could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over the child's life, which is a moral dilemma.\n\nIn terms of the surrogate's well-being, she's under stress and had a breakdown. The couple's decision might affect her emotionally and legally. But if she violated the agreement, they might have to take that into account. It's a mix of legal rights, ethical considerations, and personal preparedness. Given that they're still processing and haven't made a final decision, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. They're considering their options within the bounds of their agreement and the surrogate's actions. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're navigating a complex situation with both legal and personal factors.\n"
