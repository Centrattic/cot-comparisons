It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a surrogate due to medical issues. The surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the baby is likely to have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not accepting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in many places, especially where it's altruistic, the legal framework might allow the intended parents to make decisions about continuing the pregnancy. However, once the surrogate is pregnant, there might be legal agreements in place. If the surrogate violated the terms by using substances, that could affect the situation. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough decision. They may feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. However, they also have a responsibility to the surrogate, who may have put herself through the pregnancy expecting the child to be carried through. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are concerning and could affect the baby's health. The couple might argue that the surrogate's behavior contributed to the situation, but does that absolve them of responsibility?\n\nThe couple's decision to potentially refuse the child raises questions about their commitment. They chose surrogacy as a means to have a biological child. If they now back out because of unforeseen circumstances, does that make them the \"assholes\" as the question asks? It's a complex mix of their own limitations and the surrogate's actions.\n\nI also need to consider the surrogate's well-being. If she's been under stress and using substances, there might be underlying issues that the couple should address rather than just backing out. They could be in a position of power here, and their decision might impact the surrogate's mental and physical health.\n\nAnother angle is the potential child's rights. If the child is born with disabilities, they deserve a chance to live, but the parents' ability to care for them is a valid concern. However, the couple did consent to this pregnancy, even if they didn't anticipate the specific challenges.\n\nI think the key points are the surrogate's breach of the agreement (using substances) and the couple's right to withdraw under such circumstances. If the legal agreement allows for termination due to the surrogate's misconduct, then the couple might be justified. However, if they proceed without addressing the surrogate's actions, it could be seen as neglecting her well-being. The emotional and ethical weight here is heavy on both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, the couple's decision isn't straightforward. They have legitimate concerns about their readiness, but the surrogate's actions complicate things. Depending on the legal terms and how they handle the situation (e.g., involving the agency, supporting the surrogate), they might not be entirely in the wrong. However, their initial decision to pursue surrogacy with the understanding that it's altruistic and the surrogate's role might mean the couple has obligations beyond just the child's health.\n"
