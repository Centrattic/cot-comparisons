It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate, and after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida, they're considering refusing the child because the surrogate was smoking and drinking during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy for profit is illegal where they are, so it's altruistic. In many jurisdictions, especially in altruistic surrogacy arrangements, the legal rights and responsibilities can be complex. If the surrogate was smoking and drinking, which are harmful to the fetus, that might be a legal issue. The couple might have grounds to take legal action against the surrogate for endangering the child. However, they also might be legally bound to accept the child once born, depending on the laws. \n\nEthically, the couple is in a tough spot. They didn't expect the health issues and feel unprepared to care for a child with such needs. They might feel betrayed by the surrogate's actions, which contributed to the fetus's condition. But is it their fault? They might not be in the wrong because they had a right to know the risks and the surrogate's behavior. However, deciding to terminate the pregnancy after it's already in progress raises ethical questions. Is it right to abandon a child because of its health conditions? That could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are problematic. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy are known risks, and she broke down under stress. But she's also under contract (even if not for profit), so the couple's responsibility towards her and the child needs to be considered. If they proceed with the pregnancy knowing the surrogate's actions, they might be putting the child at further risk. But if they terminate, they might be ending a life that could have had support.\n\nLegally, the couple might need to report the surrogate's behavior to authorities, especially if it's endangering the child. However, depending on the country's laws, they might not have the right to terminate the pregnancy. If they can't terminate, they might have to proceed with the birth and then make a decision about their ability to care for the child. \n\nEthically, the couple's decision is based on their readiness to care for a child with special needs. They might be honest about their limitations, which is important for the child's well-being. However, choosing not to parent due to the child's disabilities can be viewed as unethical. It's a matter of personal values versus societal expectations. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for their feelings or the situation. The surrogate's actions are the main issue here. The couple might have legal recourse against her, but they also have responsibilities once the child is born. Whether they are in the wrong depends on the legal framework and societal views on disability. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the surrogate's actions contributed to the situation, and the couple is making a difficult decision based on their circumstances. However, some might argue they have a moral obligation to proceed. But given the context, the author's position isn't clearly wrong.\n"
