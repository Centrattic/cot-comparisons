It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate to have a child. The surrogate has been using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, and the baby is likely to have Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not accepting the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by country, but in the scenario, it's stated that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. The surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, which is harmful to the fetus. Legally, if the surrogacy contract allows for termination or other actions in such cases, the couple might have some grounds. However, in many jurisdictions, once the pregnancy is underway, the surrogate has certain rights, and the intended parents might not have the legal right to terminate the pregnancy against her will.\n\nEthically, the couple's reasons for not wanting the child are about being unprepared for the lifelong responsibilities of caring for a child with disabilities. This is a personal and complex decision. While it's valid for them to feel unprepared, the surrogate's actions (drugs and alcohol) add another layer. They might feel betrayed and responsible for the situation, but the child's well-being is also a concern. The surrogate's health and the child's health are intertwined here.\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate's substance use yet, which could be a point of contention. If the surrogacy agency is involved, they might need to handle the situation according to their policies. However, the couple is in a difficult position because they've already invested a lot emotionally and financially, and now they're facing unexpected challenges.\n\nThe question is whether the couple is in the wrong for choosing not to accept the child. On one hand, they have a right to consider their ability to care for a child. On the other hand, the child's right to life and the surrogate's responsibilities must be considered. The surrogate's actions were harmful, but the couple might not be at fault for the disabilities themselves, which were likely present before the substance use.\n\nIn terms of judgment, it's a tough call. The couple's decision is based on their capacity to care for the child, which is a personal choice. However, by using a surrogate, they might have taken on certain responsibilities. If the surrogate's actions contributed to the child's health issues, the couple might feel justified in reconsidering. But the child's life is also a factor here. It's a complex ethical dilemma without a clear right or wrong answer.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because their decision is based on their readiness and the unforeseen circumstances, even though it's a difficult choice. However, they need to handle the situation legally and ethically, possibly involving the agency and considering the child's welfare.\n"
