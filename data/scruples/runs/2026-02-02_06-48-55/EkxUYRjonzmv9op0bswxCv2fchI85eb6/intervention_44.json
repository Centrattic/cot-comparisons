It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The couple tried to have a baby for years, and due to medical issues, they went into surrogacy, which is altruistic where they live. The surrogate is now five months pregnant, and they found out the baby might have Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, citing stress as a reason.\n\nThe main question is whether the couple is wrong for considering not wanting the baby anymore. The author is asking if they're the bad guys for possibly refusing the child. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethics here. The couple went through a lot to have a biological child, and now they're faced with medical issues that could change their lives. They also learned that the surrogate was using harmful substances during the pregnancy. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the baby's conditions, or at least added risk. \n\nBut then, the couple's decision to possibly not take the child\u2014does that make them wrong? On one hand, they might feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs. On the other, they chose a surrogate and agreed to the process. If they back out now, the surrogate might be left in a difficult position, and the child's future is uncertain. \n\nAlso, the couple hasn't reported the surrogate's behavior yet, which could be a problem. The surrogate violated the terms of the agreement, but the couple is holding back. They might be worried about how it looks if they focus on the surrogate's actions instead of the baby's diagnosis. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since surrogacy is altruistic, maybe there are different agreements in place. If the couple can legally terminate the pregnancy based on the diagnosis, they might have that right. However, ethically, deciding not to have a child because of Down Syndrome could be seen as discriminatory, even if they weren't prepared for it. \n\nThe surrogate's actions complicate things. If the medical issues are a result of her behavior, then maybe the couple has grounds to reassess. But if the conditions are due to genetic factors, even without the surrogate's influence, then the decision is more about their readiness. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) the couple's right to make decisions about their family, 2) the surrogate's responsibility, and 3) the ethical implications of choosing not to have a child with disabilities. \n\nIn many societies, Down Syndrome is not grounds for termination unless there are other severe complications. The couple might feel overwhelmed, but choosing not to raise a child because of its disability could be seen as discriminatory. However, considering the surrogate's actions, maybe the couple's decision is influenced by both the medical issues and the surrogate's negligence, which complicates their position. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple feels they cannot provide the necessary care, it's a personal choice. But they also have to consider the surrogate's situation and the legal/ethical consequences of backing out now. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose not to take the baby, they might be seen as avoiding responsibility based on the child's disability, which is a sensitive issue. But if the surrogate's actions contributed to the problems, then maybe their decision is more about the surrogate's negligence. \n\nI'm leaning towards thinking the author isn't in the wrong because they made a difficult decision based on unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's actions. However, others might argue that all children deserve a chance regardless of their needs. But given the context of the surrogate's behavior and the couple's lack of preparedness, maybe their stance is understandable. \n\nBut then again, is it the author's fault for not anticipating these issues? They might have known the risks of surrogacy but didn't expect this. So, it's a complex situation where both parties have some responsibility. \n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the decision is based on the child's disability or the surrogate's actions. If it's the former, it's more ethically questionable. If it's the latter, maybe it's more about protecting the child from a negligent environment. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
