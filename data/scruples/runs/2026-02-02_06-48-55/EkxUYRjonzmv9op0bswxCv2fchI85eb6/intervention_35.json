It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the child born via surrogacy. The situation involves the surrogate breaking the agreement by smoking and drinking during pregnancy, leading to the child having Down syndrome and spina bifida. The parents are now considering not taking the child.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal and ethical aspects. The surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, which might affect their legal obligations. If the surrogate violated the terms (like substance abuse), maybe the parents have grounds to withdraw. But I should check if there are laws about this. In some jurisdictions, even altruistic surrogacy agreements can have legal enforceability, but this varies.\n\nThen, the parents' reasoning is that they're unprepared for the lifelong care of a child with disabilities. That's a sensitive area. While it's their right to make decisions about their family, using the child's condition as a reason to refuse might be seen as discriminatory or unethical. However, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, which complicates things.\n\nThe parents also mention they didn't want to report the surrogate yet, which could indicate they're trying to handle it privately. But the surrogate's behavior is a significant breach, which might affect the legal standing of the surrogacy agreement.\n\nEthically, it's a tight spot. The parents are under stress and facing unexpected challenges. But the decision to terminate or refuse based on the child's condition raises ethical concerns. However, the surrogate's actions might have played a role in the fetus's condition, which could shift some responsibility.\n\nI need to consider if the parents are acting selfishly or if they have valid concerns. The surrogate's breach is a key point here. If the surrogacy contract allowed them to terminate due to such breaches, they might be justified. But without that, they might be in a tricky legal and ethical situation.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the surrogate's actions negate the parents' responsibility. If the parents can legally and ethically withdraw due to the surrogate's breach, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're choosing to terminate solely because of the child's condition, that's problematic. However, since the surrogate's actions contributed, it's a bit more balanced. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the surrogate's breach complicates the situation, and the parents are facing unforeseen circumstances.\n"
