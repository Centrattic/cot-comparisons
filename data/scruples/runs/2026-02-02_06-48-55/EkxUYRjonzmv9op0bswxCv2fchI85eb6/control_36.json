It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife can't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and they found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Also, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. They're worried about being insensitive and not ready to be caregivers for a child with those conditions. They also mention the surrogate's actions affecting a life that's not hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit, maybe there are legal agreements in place. If the surrogate used substances, that could be a breach of the agreement. Maybe the couple has the right to terminate the pregnancy based on that? But they might have a contract that outlines responsibilities, so maybe they can take legal action instead of just refusing the baby.\n\nEthically, people have different views on this. Some might say the couple has the right to decide whether they can care for a child with special needs. Others might argue that once the pregnancy is underway, the child's rights come into play. However, the surrogate's actions (substance use) could be seen as endangering the child, which complicates things.\n\nThe couple is also facing a significant life change. They weren't prepared for the possibility of disabilities, which is understandable. But is it wrong to prioritize their own readiness over the child's potential? It's a tough call. The surrogate's behavior might give the couple grounds to reconsider, especially if it affects the baby's health.\n\nI should also consider the surrogate's well-being. She's under stress and used substances, which is concerning. They might need to report this to the agency, not just for their sake but for the baby's. But the couple is hesitant to report it yet. Are they being irresponsible by not addressing it? Or are they just trying to process the information?\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for potentially refusing the child. If the couple has a legal right to terminate due to the surrogate's actions, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the refusal is solely based on the disabilities, that might be seen as insensitive. However, the couple's decision might be more about their ability to care for the child rather than the child's worth.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in a complex situation. The surrogate's behavior is a red flag, which could be a legal issue. The couple's decision to not proceed might be influenced by both the surrogate's actions and their own readiness. They might not be in the wrong if they act within legal boundaries and consider the child's best interest. But if they're only refusing due to disabilities, that's more ethically questionable. However, the main reason here seems to be the surrogate's negligence and the unexpected challenges, which complicates the judgment. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, given the circumstances, especially if they have a legal recourse against the surrogate for her actions.\n"
