It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering refusing the baby conceived via surrogacy. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple has been struggling with infertility due to medical issues. Surrogacy was their last resort, and it's altruistic since it's illegal for profit. The surrogate is five months pregnant with their biological child. Now, they found out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida. Also, the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThe main points here are the couple's right to make decisions about their child and the surrogate's actions. They are considering not taking the baby because they feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. The surrogate's substance use could affect the baby's health further.\n\nLegally, since surrogacy is altruistic, the process might have specific terms. The couple might have legal rights to make decisions, but if they proceed with refusal, it could lead to legal complications. However, their reasoning is about being unprepared for the child's needs, which is a personal decision. They aren't necessarily at fault for not wanting a child they feel unprepared to care for, but ethically, it's a gray area. The surrogate's actions might also be a point of concern\u2014they broke their agreement, which could impact the baby's health. The couple is upset about the surrogate \"toying with a life,\" which adds to their decision.\n\nEthically, people can have different views. Some might say they're being selfish, while others see them as realistic. They might need to consider legal steps first, maybe reporting the surrogate's actions and consulting the agency. But the question is about being in the wrong. If they choose to proceed with the pregnancy, they might face challenges, but if they terminate or refuse, it's their choice based on their circumstances. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal decision based on their readiness and the surrogate's actions complicate things further. However, there's a moral aspect to consider the child's well-being. Still, the primary responsibility lies with the parents-to-be to make the best decision for their family.\n"
