It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the parents-to-be are considering refusing the child because of potential disabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic and not for profit in their country, the legal framework might be different from commercial surrogacy. I should check if the laws in their jurisdiction allow termination or refusal in such cases. Also, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might have legal implications, especially if it endangered the fetus.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents are facing a dilemma. They didn't anticipate the health issues and feel unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with Down syndrome and spina bifida. Their concerns about being caregivers are valid. However, they also mention feeling upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life,\" which adds another layer. The surrogate's actions might have contributed to the child's condition, but it's not clear if that's the case. Alcohol and smoking can increase the risk of certain birth defects, but Down syndrome is typically due to genetic factors, not lifestyle choices.\n\nThe parents might be struggling with guilt and fear. They might be considered selfish for not wanting a child with disabilities, but it's their right to consider their readiness. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, especially if she wasn't supposed to engage in harmful behaviors. The fact that she broke down and admitted stress complicates things; maybe there's an issue with support systems in place for surrogates.\n\nI should also consider the child's future. If the parents back out, who would take care of the child? The surrogate might not be able to care for it, so there could be legal and emotional consequences. The parents might be in a difficult position where they feel they can't handle the responsibilities, but the surrogate's negligence might make it harder to find another option.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's tricky. The parents' decision not to proceed could be seen as callous, but if the surrogate's actions contributed to the risks, it's a different scenario. However, the parents have a right to make decisions about their family. They might also be in a legal grey area regarding termination or refusal. The key points are the surrogate's actions, the parents' preparedness, and the legal implications of ending the surrogacy.\n\nOverall, while the parents' decision to refuse the child might be legally possible, especially if the surrogate breached the agreement, ethically it's a complex situation. They might not be in the wrong if the surrogate's actions were negligent, but there's a strong argument that they're being selfish by not accepting the child despite the challenges. The final answer might depend more on the legal context than the ethical one, but the user is asking for a moral judgment.\n"
