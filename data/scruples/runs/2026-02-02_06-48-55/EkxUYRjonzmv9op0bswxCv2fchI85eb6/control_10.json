It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing their unborn child via surrogacy. The parents had a genetic test that showed a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida, and the surrogate has been using substances. They're worried about becoming caregivers and not being ready for that, so they're thinking of not taking the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal context. The post mentions that surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's altruistic. In such cases, the legal framework might differ from commercial surrogacy. I know in some places, even in altruistic arrangements, the surrogate might have certain rights, but the couple might also have the right to know if the baby has severe conditions. However, the main issue here is the parents' intention to refuse the baby once born. \n\nThe parents' reasons: they're unprepared for the lifelong commitment of caring for a child with significant health issues. They might feel overwhelmed, which is a valid emotional response. But is it wrong? Well, every parent might have unexpected challenges, and the decision to continue a pregnancy after knowing the risks is personal. However, the baby would still be their biological child, and they have a responsibility once it's born. \n\nThe surrogate's actions of smoking and drinking during pregnancy are concerning. That could potentially affect the baby's development further. The parents might be upset because the surrogate's behavior could have contributed to the child's health issues. But the core question is about the parents' right to refuse the baby. \n\nIn surrogacy agreements, there might be provisions about termination if certain conditions are found. But since they are in the second trimester (5 months pregnant), termination options might be limited legally. If they proceed with the birth but then refuse the child, what happens? Do they have the right to? Or does the child automatically become the surrogate's? \n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. The parents are facing a significant life change and might be feeling scared. However, once the child is born, it's their legal and moral responsibility to care for it. Refusing the child could leave the surrogate with a child she didn't plan on keeping, which is also problematic. \n\nBut the parents might not have known about the surrogate's substance use beforehand. The surrogate was supposed to be altruistic but engaged in harmful behavior. Maybe the parents are justified in feeling the surrogate wasn't responsible, which adds to their decision. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether refusing the baby is ethical or legal. If the surrogacy contract doesn't allow for termination, the parents might be in a difficult position. They could be considered the child's legal parents, so not accepting the child might not be an option. \n\nAlso, the parents' admission that they're not ready for the caregiving role might be seen as a failure in commitment. But considering the unexpected circumstances, maybe it's understandable. However, the child is already being brought into the world, and the parents can't just walk away. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards yes (A) because regardless of the challenges, the parents have a responsibility once the child is born. But there's the aspect of the surrogate breaking the agreement by using substances, which complicates things. \n\nBut the main question is about the parents' right to refuse. If they're the legal parents, they can't just refuse the child. The surrogate might have to take responsibility, but that's not the parents' call. Therefore, maybe the parents are in the wrong for even considering it. \n\nAlternatively, if the surrogacy contract allows for termination due to medical conditions, the answer could be different. But the post doesn't mention that. It just says they're not sure what their options are. \n\nSo the parents might not be in the wrong if they're following legal avenues, but if they're trying to walk away without proper legal steps, they could be. However, the ethical aspect is that once the child is born, they can't just refuse it. So perhaps the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they have a duty to their child now, and not being ready doesn't negate that responsibility. Also, the way they phrase \"toying with a life\" might be seen as irresponsible themselves.\n"
