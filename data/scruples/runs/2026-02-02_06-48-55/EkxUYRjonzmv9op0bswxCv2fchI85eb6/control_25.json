It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that they went through surrogacy because their wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now pregnant, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Plus, the surrogate has been smoking and drinking. The couple is considering not taking the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws can vary, but in this case, it's altruistic and not for profit. The couple might have a legal right to terminate the pregnancy, but that's a big decision. There's a question about their responsibility towards the surrogate. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be harmful to the baby, which the couple might not have known about. But they're also making a choice based on the baby's potential health issues.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple is facing a tough situation. They weren't prepared for the possibility of caring for a child with significant needs. The surrogate's behavior adds another layer of complexity. But is it wrong to consider their own limitations? Some might argue that every child deserves a chance, but others might see the couple's perspective that they're not equipped for the lifetime commitment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the surrogate's responsibility. If she breached the agreement by using substances, maybe the couple has grounds to reconsider. However, the surrogate's mental health and stress might be factors too. They broke down, so maybe there was underlying pressure or not enough support.\n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, so they're in a holding pattern. They're conflicted between their personal readiness and the surrogate's actions. The key here is whether their decision to back out is seen as selfish or a responsible choice given the circumstances. Different people might have different views, but legally and ethically, it's a nuanced issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a difficult decision based on their own capacity to care for the child and the surrogate's undisclosed actions.\n"
