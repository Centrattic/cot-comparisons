It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about surrogacy. The couple had a hard time conceiving and found a surrogate through an altruistic program since for-profit surrogacy is illegal. The surrogate is five months pregnant with their biological child. Then they had an amniocentesis that showed a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. Now, the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and is unsure about their options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy agreements can vary, but since it's altruistic, maybe there are specific legal terms in place. The couple might have the right to make decisions based on the baby's health, but this is a big decision. They're worried about being seen as insensitive, but they feel overwhelmed by the potential responsibilities of raising a child with disabilities.\n\nThe surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are concerning because those can affect the baby's health. The couple might feel that the surrogate's behavior has compromised the pregnancy, which adds to their stress. However, the surrogate is under stress and used these as coping mechanisms. It's a tough spot for everyone involved.\n\nEthically, the couple's right to make decisions about their child's future is a factor. They may not have anticipated the challenges of caring for a child with significant needs. But then again, bringing a child into the world with disabilities and then deciding not to take responsibility could be seen as selfish. However, the surrogate's actions might also impact the situation, as her behavior could have contributed to the complications.\n\nLegally, they need to check the surrogacy agreement. If the contract allows termination or if there's a clause about unexpected circumstances, that might guide their options. If not, they might need to involve the agency or seek legal advice. The surrogate's rights and responsibilities are also part of this, especially since she broke the terms by using substances during pregnancy.\n\nEmotionally, the couple is struggling with guilt and fear. They might feel they're failing their future child but also worried about being judged. The surrogate is also in emotional distress after being discovered. The child's well-being is a key concern here\u2014whether terminating the pregnancy is in the child's best interest or if another option like adoption is possible.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the surrogacy agreement doesn't cover termination, the couple might not have the legal right to refuse the child. However, if they have the right, their decision could be seen as a personal choice based on their capacity to care. The ethical dilemma is balancing their rights with the child's needs and the surrogate's responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong if the legal terms allow for termination and they're making a considered decision based on their ability to care for the child. But if there's no legal option, they might not be in the wrong for not wanting to proceed, depending on the circumstances. However, the surrogate's actions complicate things. Ultimately, the answer likely hinges on the legal framework of the surrogacy agreement and the ethical stance on parental rights versus responsibilities.\n"
