It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering refusal of the child conceived via surrogacy. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple tried for years to have a child, and due to medical issues, they went through surrogacy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant with their biologically related child. They had an amniocentesis showing a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida. Then the surrogate admitted to drinking and smoking during pregnancy, which is a problem. Now they're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure about their options.\n\nSo, the main points here: medical issues with the baby, surrogate's health risks (drinking/smoking), and the couple's feelings about being caregivers for a child with significant needs.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by country and state. The user mentions it's altruistic and for-profit is illegal. So they might be in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is regulated but not commercial. They need to check their specific laws. Legally, they might still have options, but it's a complex area. They should consult their surrogacy agency and legal counsel to understand if they can terminate the pregnancy or if the surrogate has rights. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally.\n\nEthically, the couple is facing a tough decision. They didn't expect this situation and are worried about the long-term impact of raising a child with these conditions. They also feel the surrogate endangered the child. However, the surrogate might have had her own struggles, leading her to smoke and drink. The couple might feel justified in their decision, thinking they're protecting the child from potential harm due to the surrogate's behavior and considering their own ability to care for the child.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are a problem. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy are harmful and could have affected the baby's health. The couple might be upset because the surrogate wasn't taking proper care of the child they entrusted to her. However, the surrogate might have her own reasons for this behavior, like stress or lack of support, which could affect how the situation is viewed morally.\n\nThe couple's decision to not want the baby isn't just about the diagnosis but also the surrogate's negligence. They might believe that the child is better off not being born into a situation where the surrogate didn't care for it properly, especially if they can't guarantee a good life as caregivers. But others might argue that life is valuable regardless of circumstances and that they should find a way to support the child.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the surrogate's well-being. She might be under stress and broke down in the meeting. They need to consider her rights and well-being too. If they proceed to terminate, it affects her as well. They might be seen as inconsiderate if they don't support her through this, but if the surrogate put the baby at risk, that could shift the moral balance.\n\nIn terms of being \"wrong,\" the couple isn't choosing to harm the baby but are reevaluating their readiness. However, some might see it as abandoning the child they created, especially since it's biologically theirs. Others might understand the complexity of their decision given the unforeseen challenges and the surrogate's actions.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the couple's responsibility, the surrogate's role, the baby's potential well-being, and their own capacity to care. Legally, they might have options, but morally, it's a gray area. They could be seen as acting in their own best interest and the baby's, considering the surrogate's negligence and the challenges of raising a child with disabilities. On the other hand, some might argue that they should have accepted the situation, given that surrogacy is inherently risky and they knew the possibility of complications.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the couple's decision is seen as selfish versus realistic. If they are making an informed choice based on their ability to care for the child and the surrogate's negligence, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're dismissing the child's life solely based on disabilities, that's more controversial. Since they are reacting to both the medical issues and the surrogate's actions, it's a mix. But given the context, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong because they are considering the child's best interest and their own capacity to care, especially after the surrogate's failure. But I need to check if the question is about legal wrong or moral. The question is \"in the wrong,\" which is moral. So I need to decide based on that.\n"
