It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, unexpected health issues in the fetus, and the surrogate's behavior.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant, and the amniocentesis shows high chances of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which are harmful during pregnancy. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure if they can refuse it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the couple's decision based on the baby's potential health issues and the surrogate's actions. The question is about whether they're wrong for not wanting to proceed.\n\nLegally, this depends on the surrogacy laws in their country. Since it's altruistic and not for profit, there might be no contractual obligations, but laws vary. The couple might have rights to terminate, especially if the surrogate violated the agreement by smoking and drinking, which affects the child's health.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. Choosing not to have a child with disabilities is a personal decision. Down syndrome and spina bifida require significant care, and the couple might feel unprepared. However, others might argue that life is valuable regardless of disabilities. The surrogate's actions also play a role here\u2014her behavior could be seen as negligent, which might support the couple's decision.\n\nThe couple is concerned about being insensitive, but they're also reacting to new information and the surrogate's actions. They might be considering the child's future well-being as much as their own capacity to care for a child with special needs.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong isn't straightforward. Legally, they might have grounds, especially if the surrogate breached the agreement. Ethically, it's a tough call between personal choice and the child's rights. But since the question asks for a clear answer between A and B, and considering that the couple made a difficult decision based on new circumstances and the surrogate's actions, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue they should take responsibility regardless, making it a close call. Given the surrogate's misconduct and the unexpected health issues, B seems plausible.\n"
