It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, and the couple is considering refusing the child after finding out about potential disabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The couple tried for years, faced medical issues, and used a surrogate in a place where surrogacy is altruistic. The surrogate is now 5 months pregnant. The baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which adds another layer.\n\nThe main question is about whether the couple is wrong for not wanting the baby anymore. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider legal aspects first. Since their country doesn't allow surrogacy for profit, maybe there are specific laws about termination or refusal. If they agreed to surrogacy, do they have the right to refuse the child? If the surrogate drank and smoked, that's a problem for the child's health, but does that affect the couple's rights?\n\nEthically, the couple is worried about being lifelong caregivers for a child with significant needs. They didn't plan for this and aren't ready. However, they might have obligations to the child, regardless of the situation. The surrogate's actions (substance use) might make them question her suitability, but that's a different issue.\n\nThe couple's reasons for not wanting the child are based on their ability to care for it. But once a child is born, parents can't just walk away, unless there's legal grounds. They might need to involve child services if they can't care for it. Also, the surrogate's actions could lead to legal consequences for her, which might affect the child's placement.\n\nThe user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If they decide not to take the child, are they abandoning it? That could be seen as wrong because the child has a right to be cared for. However, the couple might not be legally responsible if the surrogacy agreement doesn't bind them to the child if certain conditions arise. But without knowing the exact legal terms, it's hard. \n\nAnother angle: the couple's right to reproductive autonomy. They might feel they have the right to not have a child they're unprepared for. But once the child is born, they can't just leave them with the surrogate. They might need to make other arrangements, like adoption, but that's complicated in surrogacy cases. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, which might give the couple grounds to terminate the surrogacy. If the agreement had clauses about substance use, that might be a factor. But if they didn't report it yet, maybe they should go through the agency to address it.\n\nEmotionally, the couple is struggling and feeling conflicted. They might be seen as not ready, but they are also dealing with unexpected challenges. The key is whether they have a legal or ethical obligation to take the child regardless. If they don't, and the child is taken away, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they abandon the child, that's definitely wrong.\n\nIn summary, without knowing the legal specifics of their surrogacy contract and local laws, it's hard to say definitively. However, ethically, they might not be in the wrong if they can provide for the child's needs through other means, but legally and morally, they might have obligations. The surrogate's actions complicate things further. If they proceed to refuse the child without proper legal steps, they could be seen as wrong, but if they follow the correct procedures, maybe not. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) if they act within legal bounds, but the answer might require more info.\n"
