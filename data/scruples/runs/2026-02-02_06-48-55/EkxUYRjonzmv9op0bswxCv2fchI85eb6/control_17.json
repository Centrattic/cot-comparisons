It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Will I Be the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate, and now they're considering refusing the baby after finding out about potential disabilities and the surrogate's substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Surrogacy laws vary by country, but the user mentioned it's altruistic and for profit is illegal. That might mean the surrogate isn't being paid beyond expenses, which is a key point. The couple might have legal rights to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is using substances, especially since that could harm the fetus. However, the surrogate's disclosure of drinking and smoking after the fact complicates things. Did they know this before agreeing to carry the pregnancy? If the surrogate lied or hid this, the couple might have grounds for legal action.\n\nThen there's the issue of the pregnancy's health implications. The couple is worried about Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida, which would require significant care. The question is whether they're allowed to terminate or refuse the child based on that. In some jurisdictions, parents can terminate if the fetus has severe abnormalities, but that's ethically contentious. Also, the surrogate's behavior (smoking and drinking) might lead the couple to seek termination, which could be legally permissible if it's proven that the substances pose a risk.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the couple's feelings are valid. They didn't anticipate the child's needs and are concerned about their readiness. However, the decision to terminate or refuse the child after the surrogate's misconduct needs to consider the surrogate's rights too. If the couple proceeds, they might be seen as callous for not wanting the child due to disabilities, but if the surrogate's actions endangered the baby, they have a responsibility to protect the child.\n\nThe legal angle is crucial here. If the surrogacy contract allows the intended parents to terminate if the surrogate engages in harmful behavior, then the couple might have a valid case. Without knowing the specific laws in their country, it's hard to say for sure, but the fact that surrogacy is altruistic suggests there might be more protections for the surrogate. However, the surrogate's substance abuse could be a factor in allowing termination.\n\nAlso, the couple hasn't reported to the agency yet, which might be a problem. They need to go through proper channels to address the surrogate's actions. The ethical dilemma here is whether the couple is being responsible by considering the child's well-being (if the surrogate's actions harm the fetus) or if they're making a selfish decision based on the child's potential disabilities.\n\nIn some places, parents can't legally terminate a pregnancy just because of fetal abnormalities unless there's a medical reason. If the child is viable, the couple might have to carry the pregnancy to term, unless the surrogate's actions are deemed to have endangered the fetus. So, the key factors are the legality of termination in their jurisdiction, the surrogate's disclosure of substance use, and the terms of the surrogacy agreement.\n\nOverall, the couple's decision is complex. They're in a tough spot, but if the surrogate's behavior is proven to be harmful and that's allowed under the surrogacy laws, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their main issue is the child's disabilities, that's a more sensitive area. So the answer might hinge on the legal framework and the surrogate's actions. Since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be either A or B depending on these factors. But given the information provided, the couple's concerns are partially justified if the surrogate's actions are illegal or harmful. Therefore, the answer might be B (they are not in the wrong) because they have valid legal and ethical reasons based on the surrogate's misconduct and the potential risks to the child.\n"
