It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, a medical issue with the baby, and the surrogate breaking the agreement by using drugs and alcohol.\n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because of medical issues. They had an amniocentesis that showed Down Syndrome and spina bifida. Now the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which are harmful to the fetus. The couple is considering not taking the baby, but they're unsure if they're being insensitive.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic in their country, they might not have a legal agreement that allows termination. The surrogate's actions could be a breach of the surrogacy agreement, especially if she was supposed to avoid harmful substances. The couple might have a right to know about this, and the surrogate's disclosure could be late.\n\nBut the couple is also facing a difficult decision. They didn't sign up for a child with disabilities and are worried about the lifelong commitment. However, they have a right to be informed about the surrogate's behavior that affects the child's health. The ethical dilemma is whether their decision is selfish or a valid consideration of their readiness.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are definitely problematic. She used substances that could harm the baby, and this might be a reason for the couple to reconsider. However, they also have to think about the surrogate's well-being and the legal implications of terminating the pregnancy. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the couple might not be responsible for the surrogate's actions, but they might be at fault if they didn't address the surrogate's health issues earlier. However, given the circumstances, their concern for the child's health and their own readiness is understandable. The key is whether their refusal is a valid response to the surrogate's breach and the medical risks.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on the surrogate's actions and their own preparedness, not just the baby's condition. The surrogate's behavior is a significant factor here.\n"
