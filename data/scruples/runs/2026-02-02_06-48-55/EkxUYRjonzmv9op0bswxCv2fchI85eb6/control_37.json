It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the WIBTA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. Surrogacy is altruistic, so no financial incentive. The surrogate broke the agreement by using substances, which is risky for the baby. The couple is now facing a potential disability scenario they weren't prepared for. They're considering not accepting the child, which raises ethical and legal questions.\n\nThe main issues here are the surrogate's actions versus the couple's responsibility. The surrogate's behavior could endanger the fetus, which might contribute to the birth defects. However, the couple might also feel they were set up for an unexpected situation. Legally, in many places, especially with altruistic surrogacy, the laws might be less clear than commercial ones. The couple might have the right to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is breaching the agreement by using substances. However, if the pregnancy is already at 5 months, termination options might be limited depending on local laws.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is complex. They might feel they aren't equipped to care for a child with such needs, which is a valid concern. However, the surrogate's actions could be considered a breach of trust, which might absolve the couple of some responsibility. But if they proceed to reject the baby, what happens to the child? They might need to find another way to care for it, which raises questions about their responsibility even if the surrogate failed.\n\nI should also consider if the couple is in the wrong for not wanting the child. They could be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the child's life, but their concerns about being caregivers for a lifetime are real. However, the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation, so the wrong isn't entirely on the couple. The answer might depend on the legal framework and how the surrogacy agreement was structured. If the agreement allowed for termination in such cases, the couple might be within their rights. If not, they might face legal challenges.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision isn't straightforward. They have valid concerns and the surrogate's actions were problematic. Whether they are in the wrong depends on the legal terms of the surrogacy and their actions in response. Since the surrogate broke the agreement, the couple might not be in the wrong. However, rejecting the child after this point could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a complicated scenario. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful about the nuances here.\n"
