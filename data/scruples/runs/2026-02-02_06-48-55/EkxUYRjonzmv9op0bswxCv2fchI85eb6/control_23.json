It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple using a surrogate due to medical issues. The surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Surrogacy laws vary, but in some places where it's altruistic, the surrogate might have certain rights. The couple's right to terminate the pregnancy could depend on the terms agreed upon in the surrogacy contract. If they didn't include clauses about substance use or medical conditions, it complicates things.\n\nEthically, the couple's concerns are valid. They might feel unprepared for the challenges of raising a child with special needs. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be seen as harmful, possibly affecting the fetus. The couple's decision to not proceed might be influenced by the surrogate's behavior, which complicates the moral standpoint.\n\nThe couple's emotional state is also a factor. They might feel pressured or overwhelmed. But choosing not to continue the pregnancy could be seen as abandoning the child, which raises ethical questions about responsibility.\n\nAlso, the surrogate's well-being is important. If she's under stress, she might need support. However, her actions (substance use) might have contributed to the situation. The couple's reaction is understandable, but they need to consider the legal and ethical implications of their decision.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a tough call. The couple isn't acting out of malice but out of a desire to prepare and be responsible. However, they might have obligations to both the child and the surrogate. Without legal clarity, their decision could be seen as self-serving. But given the circumstances, their feelings of being unprepared are valid. So, maybe the answer isn't straightforward, but the options are A or B. The user wants a single answer. Considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their concerns are legitimate, but it's a complex situation.\n"
