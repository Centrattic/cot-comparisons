It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic, but she's been using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy. The parents found out the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and Spina Bifida. They're considering not taking the baby, but they're unsure if that's the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic in their country, maybe there are laws about termination or the surrogate's rights. If the surrogate is breaking the agreement by using substances, that might be a problem. But I'm not sure how strict the laws are here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The parents wanted a child but now face a situation where they might not be prepared for a child with disabilities. They also feel the surrogate violated the trust by using drugs. Is it selfish to back out when the child is not theirs? But they might be responsible for the child regardless. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions could have harmed the baby, so maybe the parents have a right to be concerned.\n\nThe surrogate's well-being is another angle. If they terminate, what happens to her? She might have legal recourse. The parents are in a tough spot between their expectations and the surrogate's actions. Also, the parents might be considering the long-term care needed for a child with disabilities, which they're not ready for. But is it right to abandon the child because of that? Maybe they need to explore options like adoption or support services instead of termination.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are wrong for not wanting the baby anymore. If they decide to proceed with termination, they might be seen as irresponsible or heartless. However, if the surrogate's actions compromised the baby's health, maybe they have valid reasons. But they should have discussed these possibilities beforehand. The parents might have a right to back out if the surrogate breached the agreement, but legally, it's complicated.\n\nIn the end, it's a mix of legal, ethical, and personal factors. The answer isn't straightforward. The parents might be in the right if the surrogate violated the terms, but they also need to consider the child's future. Since the options aren't clear-cut, it's possible neither side is entirely at fault. But the user is asking for a yes/no answer based on the scenario. Given the surrogate's misconduct and the parents' lack of readiness, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's ambiguity.\n"
