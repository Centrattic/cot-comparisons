It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking, and the couple found out their unborn child might have Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. They were referred to an altruistic surrogate since it's illegal for profit in their country. Now, midway through the pregnancy, the surrogate admitted to substance use, which poses risks to the baby. The couple is considering refusing the child, even though they're aware of the potential disabilities.\n\nThe main ethical points here are: 1) The couple's right to terminate the pregnancy if they're not prepared for a child with special needs. 2) The surrogate's actions and their implications. 3) Legal and ethical responsibilities in surrogacy agreements.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, especially where surrogacy is altruistic, the legal framework might not be as clear as commercial surrogacy. If the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) are harmful, the couple might have grounds to consider termination. However, the couple's decision to refuse the child based on the child's potential disabilities raises ethical concerns. It could be seen as discriminatory or as a valid personal choice based on their readiness to care for a child with special needs.\n\nThe surrogate breaking the agreement by using substances might be a legal issue. If the surrogacy contract includes clauses against such behavior, the couple might have legal recourse. However, the couple's decision to not proceed with the birth after this revelation could be justified if the surrogate's actions endangered the child's health. But if the couple's primary issue is the disabilities, that's more about their personal choice rather than the surrogate's conduct.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, some might argue that the couple is responsible for the surrogate's well-being and the child's rights. Terminating the pregnancy could be seen as ending a potential life, which some find unethical regardless of disabilities. Others might support the couple's right to make decisions based on their capacity and willingness to care for a child with special needs.\n\nThe legal aspect is crucial. If surrogacy laws in their country allow for termination under such circumstances, the couple might have a legal basis. But if the laws don't, they could face legal challenges. The couple's hesitation to report the surrogate might indicate they're aware of legal uncertainties.\n\nIn summary, the couple's decision is complex. They're dealing with both the surrogate's actions and their own preparedness for a child with disabilities. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the legal framework and ethical perspectives. If the surrogate violated the agreement, the couple might not be in the wrong. However, if the refusal is solely based on the child's potential disabilities, it could be seen as ethically questionable, though legally permissible in some places.\n"
