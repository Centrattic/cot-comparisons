It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, and there's a conflict between the intended parents and the surrogate. The key points are the discovery of Down Syndrome and spina bifida in the fetus, and the surrogate admitting to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of terminating a pregnancy after a surrogacy, especially when the surrogate has broken the agreed terms. The intended parents are facing a significant change in their life plans due to the potential disabilities of the child. They also mention that the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could have affected the pregnancy, which might be a breach of the surrogacy agreement.\n\nSurrogacy agreements, especially altruistic ones, often include clauses about the surrogate's health behaviors. If the surrogate violated those terms, the intended parents might have legal recourse. However, the legal aspects can vary by jurisdiction, so it's unclear if they can terminate the surrogacy.\n\nEthically, the intended parents are dealing with the reality of unforeseen circumstances. They might feel they are not prepared to care for a child with significant needs. At the same time, the surrogate's actions raise questions about her responsibility. The intended parents' decision to not proceed could be seen as a reasonable response to the surrogate's misconduct and the new information about the child's health.\n\nHowever, some might argue that life should be valued regardless of circumstances, and terminating the pregnancy could be seen as abandoning a potential child. Others might support the parents' right to make decisions based on their ability to care for the child, especially given the surrogate's non-compliance with the surrogacy terms.\n\nConsidering all factors, the decision isn't black and white, but the surrogate's actions and the unexpected disabilities complicate the situation. The intended parents might not be in the wrong if they can demonstrate that the surrogate's behavior and the child's health issues are valid reasons to reconsider the surrogacy, especially if there were contractual terms violated.\n"
