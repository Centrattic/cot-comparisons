It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, unexpected medical issues with the baby, and the surrogate's behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The couple has been trying to have a child for years, and due to medical issues, they opted for a surrogacy arrangement. The surrogate is now five months pregnant. They had an amniocentesis showing a high risk of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking, which adds complications. The couple is considering not proceeding with the pregnancy, and they're unsure if they can refuse the baby. They\u2019re also worried about being seen as insensitive.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the person asking the WIBTA question) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, surrogacy agreements are complex. Since it's altruistic and illegal for profit, the legal framework might not be as clear. The surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could affect the child's health, which might influence the couple's decision. However, the couple might not have legal grounds to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate is carrying it to term. \n\nEthically, the couple might be seen as reconsidering their decision due to unexpected circumstances. They're facing a significant life change with potential long-term caregiving. On the other hand, the surrogate's actions could be seen as irresponsible, but that doesn't automatically justify the couple's decision to refuse the baby. \n\nThe couple hasn't reported the surrogate yet, which might indicate they're still processing the situation. They might feel conflicted between their responsibility to the child and their own preparedness. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal obligation for the couple to accept the child despite the risks. If the surrogacy contract doesn't allow termination for such reasons, then the couple might be within their rights to not proceed if allowed, but if they can't terminate, their decision might be ethically questionable. \n\nAlso, the surrogate's behavior is a red flag. If the surrogacy agreement didn't specify no alcohol and tobacco use, the couple might have legal recourse against the surrogate. However, that's separate from whether they can refuse the child. \n\nThe couple's main concern is being prepared for the child's needs. They admit they're not ready for the caregiving role. That's a personal choice, but does that make them wrong? Some might argue that once a pregnancy is underway, the parents have a responsibility. Others might say that people have the right to reconsider when new information arises. \n\nThe key points are: legality of termination, the surrogate's actions, and the couple's preparedness. If they can legally terminate, then B (not wrong). If not, maybe they're in a difficult position. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, considering the ethical side, some might say they're not in the wrong for wanting to reassess their situation, especially given the surrogate's negligence. However, others might see them as avoiding responsibility.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The surrogate's actions are a significant issue, but the couple's decision to not proceed could be seen as a way to protect the child from potential harm (if the surrogate's behavior affects the child's health). However, the child's life is still valuable. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A or B. The user is asking for a judgment based on the scenario. Since the couple is facing unexpected challenges and the surrogate's actions complicate things further, it's a complex situation. However, the act of refusing the child could be seen as ethically questionable, but not necessarily \"wrong\" because they're making a tough decision based on new information and their ability to care for the child. \n\nAlternatively, if they have a legal right to terminate due to the surrogate's actions or the baby's condition, then B. If not, then maybe A. But the scenario doesn't specify legal options. The user might be seeking an ethical judgment rather than a legal one. \n\nEthically, some might argue that once they've gone through the surrogacy process, they have a responsibility to the child, even with disabilities. Others might say that the couple has the right to make decisions based on their capacity to care. The surrogate's actions might shift some blame to her, but the couple's decision is still a factor. \n\nOverall, considering the ethical dilemma and the complexity, the answer might be B (not wrong) because they're dealing with unforeseen circumstances and the surrogate's actions. However, there's a counterpoint that they're avoiding a responsibility they knew could exist when choosing to have a child via surrogacy. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they're not acting unlawfully and are making a difficult choice, then B. If they're breaking a contract or acting irresponsibly, then A. The scenario doesn't give enough legal info, so maybe the ethical stance is B.\n"
