It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who went through surrogacy because the wife has medical issues. The surrogate is now pregnant, and there's been an amniocentesis showing a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. The couple is considering not taking the baby and are unsure about their next steps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user mentioned that surrogacy is altruistic because it's illegal for profit in their country. So, the surrogate isn't getting paid beyond expenses. The key issue here is whether the couple has the right to refuse the child now that the pregnancy is at 5 months. In some jurisdictions, once the pregnancy is underway, especially with an altruistic surrogacy arrangement, the intended parents might have certain rights, but it can vary. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) might also complicate things legally if it's proven that her behavior harmed the fetus.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The couple is facing a significant life change if they have a child with Down syndrome and spina bifida. They might feel unprepared for that long-term commitment. However, the surrogate's behavior raises questions about her responsibility. She's breaking the trust of the arrangement by using substances during pregnancy, which could affect the child's health further. \n\nThe couple is also dealing with the emotional impact of the medical news. They might feel betrayed by the surrogate's actions, which adds to their stress. They haven't reported the surrogate yet, possibly because they're still processing the information and considering their options. \n\nNow, the main question: Are they in the wrong for considering not taking the child? On one hand, they have a right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the child's well-being and the surrogate's rights come into play. If the couple refuses the child, the surrogate might have to carry the pregnancy to term and then give up the child for adoption, but that depends on local laws. \n\nSince surrogacy laws vary, but the user mentioned it's altruistic, maybe the legal framework allows the intended parents to back out under certain circumstances, especially if the surrogate's actions jeopardize the child's health. The surrogate's admission could be a factor in their decision-making process. \n\nThe couple's hesitation to act might stem from fear of being seen as insensitive. However, their primary responsibility is to themselves and each other, but they also have a duty to the child's best interests. If the surrogate's actions pose a risk, they might need to take legal action to ensure the child's safety, which could involve terminating the pregnancy if possible, but that's a different issue. \n\nIn summary, the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to proceed if they can legally and ethically justify it based on the surrogate's actions and the medical conditions. They might be in a difficult position where they have to weigh their own preparedness against the child's needs. The surrogate's behavior complicates her claim to the child, possibly shifting responsibility to the intended parents. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
