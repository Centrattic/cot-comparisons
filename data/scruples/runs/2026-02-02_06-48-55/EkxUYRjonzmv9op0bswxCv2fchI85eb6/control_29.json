It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate has been smoking and drinking during pregnancy, and the genetic parents are considering refusing the child after finding out the baby might have Down syndrome and spina bifida.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Surrogacy laws can vary, but the post mentions it's altruistic and for profit is illegal. The surrogate is breaking the agreement by using harmful substances. Legally, if the surrogacy contract doesn't allow termination, they might be stuck with the pregnancy. Ethically, the parents are worried about their ability to care for a child with disabilities, which is a personal decision. They might not be in the wrong for feeling unprepared, but the surrogate's actions complicate things. Also, they haven't reported her yet, which could be a problem if there's a risk to the baby. However, the parents' concern about their own readiness is valid. The key points are the surrogate's breach of contract and the parents' right to make decisions based on their circumstances. So, is the author wrong? They might not be in the wrong for their feelings, but they need to handle the situation legally and ethically, maybe by consulting the agency and considering the child's best interest. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if their intent to refuse despite the risks makes them the asshole. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong because they didn't know the surrogate's behavior beforehand. Hmm.\n"
