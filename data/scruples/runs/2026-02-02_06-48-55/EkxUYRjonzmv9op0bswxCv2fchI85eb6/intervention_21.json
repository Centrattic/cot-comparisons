It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong when considering terminating the pregnancy due to Down syndrome and spina bifida, and because the surrogate admitted to substance use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The couple went through a lot to have a child via surrogacy, which is altruistic in their country. They discovered the baby might have significant disabilities and the surrogate's behavior could affect the child's health. The couple is conflicted about whether they can refuse the baby now. \n\nOn one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and their future. Raising a child with such conditions is a huge responsibility, and they might feel unprepared. They also mention the surrogate's actions as a reason for their distress, which adds another layer of ethical concern about the surrogate's responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's potential rights and their quality of life come into play. Even if they have Down syndrome and spina bifida, the child has a right to life. The surrogate's actions do raise questions about her responsibility, but the couple might feel they can't control that now. \n\nLegal considerations are also important. Since surrogacy for profit is illegal, the legal framework might not be as clear. They might not have the right to terminate the pregnancy at this stage once the surrogate is pregnant. They also need to consider the surrogate's well-being and the legal consequences of their actions.\n\nThe couple's emotional state is valid\u2014they're under stress and perhaps feeling betrayed by the surrogate. However, their decision hinges on the child's potential disabilities, which could be seen as discriminatory. But it's also about their ability to provide the necessary care. \n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. The couple isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a personal decision based on their capabilities and the unexpected circumstances. However, they have a responsibility to explore all legal options and consider the surrogate's situation. The key is whether they're acting in bad faith or out of genuine concern for their future and the child's well-being. Since they're considering the impact and are distressed about the surrogate's actions, it's a complex situation where they might not be the \"assholes\" but need to proceed carefully.\n"
