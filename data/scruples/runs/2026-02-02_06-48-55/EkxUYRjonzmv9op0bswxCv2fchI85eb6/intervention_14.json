It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. They found a surrogate through an altruistic agency. Now, the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe author is considering not wanting the baby anymore and is unsure if they're the bad guys. They're worried about becoming caregivers for life and aren't ready for that. Also, they feel upset that the surrogate \"toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since surrogacy is altruistic where they are, the laws might not allow them to terminate the pregnancy now that the surrogate is five months along. There might be specific legal contracts in place that dictate what happens in such cases. If the surrogate was supposed to follow certain health guidelines and she violated them, maybe the couple has grounds to terminate the agreement legally, but that's a big maybe.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The couple's decision is based on the baby's potential medical needs and their own readiness. On one hand, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. On the other hand, the baby's life is at stake, and terminating the pregnancy would end that life. Also, the surrogate's actions\u2014smoking and drinking\u2014are risky and could impact the baby's health, which complicates things. The surrogate might have a responsibility here too, but the couple might still be within their rights to reconsider if the surrogate breached their agreement.\n\nThe author mentions they were not thrilled about Down syndrome and spina bifida. Some might argue that wanting to avoid the challenges of raising a child with disabilities isn't inherently wrong, especially if they feel unprepared. Others might see this as discriminatory, but that's a deeper ethical debate.\n\nThe surrogate's actions are another point. If she knew the risks of her behavior and still chose to engage in harmful activities, that could affect the couple's decision. However, she's also a person under stress, and breaking down during the meeting shows vulnerability. The couple's response to her actions might influence public perception. If they're focusing on the surrogate's negligence as a reason to reject the baby, that could be seen as harsh, but if they're considering the baby's best interests, maybe not.\n\nLegally, the couple might not have the option to refuse the child now, especially if the surrogacy contract doesn't include provisions for such scenarios. They might have to go through legal channels, which could be complex and affect the surrogate's well-being too.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the couple might be seen as prioritizing their own preparedness over the child's rights, which could make some people think they're in the wrong. However, others might empathize with their situation, recognizing the significant life changes that come with raising a child with special needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer isn't straightforward. The author's position is influenced by legal, ethical, and personal factors. If the couple is within their legal rights and the surrogate violated terms, they might not be in the wrong. But if the decision is purely based on the child's potential disabilities without considering the surrogate's responsibilities, it could be seen as ethically questionable. The key points are the legality of their options and the surrogate's adherence to the agreement.\n"
