It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves surrogacy, a medical issue with the fetus, and the surrogate's actions. \n\nFirst, the couple went through surrogacy because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. They used an altruistic surrogate in a country where surrogacy for profit is illegal. Now, the baby has a high chance of Down Syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore. The author is questioning if they're the \"assholes\" here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider ethics, legal aspects, and emotional impact. Surrogacy agreements vary by location, but since it's altruistic, there might be less legal binding. However, the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) could be a breach of the agreement, especially if the contract prohibits harmful behavior. The couple might have the right to terminate the pregnancy if the surrogate violated terms.\n\nHowever, the couple's decision is based on the child's potential disabilities. That's a sensitive area. It's their right to make medical decisions about their pregnancy, but there's a moral aspect of not wanting a child with disabilities. It's not necessarily wrong to prioritize their own readiness, but it's a tough call. The surrogate's actions are definitely problematic, which complicates things. \n\nThe couple might also have legal options if the surrogate's behavior endangered the fetus. But the main issue is whether they're at fault for considering termination. Since the surrogate broke the agreement, the couple might not be the ones in the wrong. They're reacting to a breach and unforeseen circumstances. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a lot to unpack here.\n"
