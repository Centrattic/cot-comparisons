It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering refusing the child they conceived via surrogacy. The situation involves a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitting to smoking and drinking.\n\nFirst, the surrogacy is altruistic, meaning the surrogate isn't being paid. The parents were aware of the surrogacy process and the surrogate's role. Now, the baby has potential disabilities, and the surrogate has broken the agreement by using substances during pregnancy. The parents are conflicted about whether they can refuse the child now.\n\nThe parents' main concern is their readiness to care for a child with such needs. They feel the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation. But legally, in altruistic surrogacy, the intended parents usually have the final say, especially if the surrogate hasn't followed medical guidelines. The parents might have a right to make this decision based on the surrogate's behavior and the child's health.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. They have a right to their own life choices and the capacity to care for their child. However, terminating a pregnancy at 5 months could be a big decision. The surrogate's actions complicate matters because she violated the agreement, which might affect her rights. The parents might not be in the wrong here because they're considering their ability to raise the child and the surrogate's role in the pregnancy's health issues.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on the legal aspects and the surrogate's agreement. If the surrogacy contract allows the parents to terminate due to the surrogate's non-compliance, then the parents aren't in the wrong. But if the contract doesn't address this, it's more ambiguous. However, given the surrogate's actions and the potential for harm, the parents might be justified in their decision.\n"
