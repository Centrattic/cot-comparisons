It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a surrogacy arrangement where the surrogate was supposed to be altruistic. They found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida, and the surrogate admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. Now, the couple is considering not wanting the baby anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, laws around surrogacy agreements can vary, especially if it's altruistic. If the surrogate is not being paid, there might be fewer legal protections for her, but the couple might still be bound by the agreement they made. However, if the surrogate broke the terms by using substances during pregnancy, that could impact the agreement. But the couple also has their own rights and responsibilities.\n\nThe couple's decision to potentially refuse the child is based on the child's potential medical conditions. They feel unprepared to be caregivers for a child with significant needs. This raises the question of whether they have a right to terminate the pregnancy or walk away, especially since the surrogate's actions might have contributed to the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the couple made a commitment, and the surrogate might have expected that commitment regardless of the outcome. But the surrogate's actions (smoking and drinking) were against medical advice and could have affected the baby's health. The couple might argue that the surrogate's negligence played a role in the complications.\n\nHowever, the couple's main issue is the baby's health, not the surrogate's actions\u2014unless they can prove that her behavior directly caused the conditions. Down syndrome is a genetic condition, not caused by alcohol or smoking, though spina bifida can be influenced by folate levels, which might be affected by alcohol. But it's not a direct cause.\n\nEthically, the couple's decision is a personal one. They might feel they can't provide the necessary care, but walking away could burden the surrogate with an unwanted child. They might be seen as abandoning the baby, especially if the surrogate is now emotionally invested. However, if the surrogate's actions were a breach of the surrogacy agreement, the couple might have legal grounds to reconsider.\n\nIn terms of the surrogate, she's in a vulnerable position. She might have emotional ties to the baby now, and her actions could complicate legal proceedings. If the couple terminates the pregnancy, the surrogate might face health and emotional consequences.\n\nLegally, without a contract, it's unclear. If the surrogacy is altruistic and there's no legal agreement, the couple might still be considered the legal parents, and the surrogate is merely the carrier. But if the surrogate acted against medical guidelines, that could affect her legal standing.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing the couple's right to parent the child they envisioned against the surrogate's actions and the child's well-being. The couple might be seen as making a selfish decision, but they're also considering their ability to care for a child with significant needs. On the other hand, the surrogate's negligence could be a factor in their decision.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the legal framework and ethical stance. If the surrogacy agreement was clear and the couple followed proper procedures, they might have valid grounds. However, if the surrogate adhered to the agreement and the couple is now backing out due to unforeseen circumstances, they might be seen as the ones in the wrong. Given the scenario, the author's decision to potentially refuse the baby could be viewed as morally questionable, even if they have valid reasons.\n"
