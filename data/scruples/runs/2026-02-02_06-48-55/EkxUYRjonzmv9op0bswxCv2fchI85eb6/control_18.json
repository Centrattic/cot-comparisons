It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who used a surrogate because the wife couldn't carry a pregnancy. Now, they found out the baby has a high chance of Down syndrome and spina bifida. The surrogate also admitted to smoking and drinking during pregnancy. They're considering not wanting the baby anymore and are unsure about their next steps.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The question says surrogacy for profit is illegal there, so it's altruistic. That probably means the surrogate isn't being paid, just receiving expenses. Legal rights might be different in such cases. If the surrogate is the biological mother or not? Wait, no, the baby is biologically the couple's, so the surrogate is carrying it. So legally, once the pregnancy is established, the surrogate's rights might come into play. But since it's altruistic, maybe the legal framework allows for termination if certain conditions are found? Or maybe the couple has the right to decide after knowing the baby's condition.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The couple argues that they didn't anticipate the baby's needs and aren't prepared to be caregivers for someone with disabilities. They also express frustration that the surrogate was smoking and drinking, which they see as toying with a life. But the surrogate was stressed and using those as coping mechanisms. Is that a valid reason for the couple to back out? On one hand, they might feel pressured by the unexpected situation. On the other, they knew surrogacy is risky and maybe should have considered potential health issues. \n\nThe surrogate's actions (substance use) could be a point. If the couple didn't know about that until now, maybe they had the right to be informed. The surrogate breaking down and admitting to it might affect the couple's decision. They might feel betrayed, especially if the surrogate's behavior could have affected the baby's health. But the couple still has a choice here. \n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting the baby. Arguably, they have the right to make decisions about their family and future. They might not be able to adequately care for a child with those conditions, and it's not a case of discrimination, but rather a personal choice. However, some might argue that they have a responsibility once they've committed to surrogacy. Also, the surrogate's situation needs to be considered. If the baby is born with these conditions, she might have to give it up, which could be traumatic for her. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's welfare. If the couple can't provide the necessary care, maybe the child should be placed with others. But that's complicated, especially if the surrogacy agreement doesn't cover such scenarios. Legally, if the couple can terminate the pregnancy due to the fetus's health, they might be within their rights. But if they can't, they might have to go through with the birth and then make a decision. \n\nI need to remember that this is a hypothetical scenario, and real-life legal and ethical implications can vary. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the couple's reasons\u2014unpreparedness and the surrogate's actions\u2014it's a tough call. They might not be in the wrong if they can legally terminate, but if they proceed with termination without legal grounds, maybe they are. However, the question is about moral wrong, not legal. Ethically, some might say they're being realistic about their capabilities, while others might see it as abandonment. The surrogate's actions might also affect public opinion on the matter. \n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on the couple's right to autonomy versus the rights of the fetus and the surrogate. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's a nuanced issue. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if they're making a personal choice based on their ability to care for the child, but some might argue they should have considered these possibilities beforehand. The surrogate's behavior complicates things, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the couple of responsibility. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong.\n"
