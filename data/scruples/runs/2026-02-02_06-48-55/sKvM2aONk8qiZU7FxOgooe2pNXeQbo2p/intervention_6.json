      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one, and the author is now wondering if they made a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the friend clearly expressed not wanting a party, even though they might have said it before. The author decided to go ahead anyway, even though the party is at the friend's house, which could make things awkward. The author mentions they've been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend had explicitly stated they didn't want a party, so the author should have respected that. Even if the friend previously said they didn't mind, the latest communication was clear. On the other hand, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, not realizing the friend's feelings. However, since the friend made it known again today, the author should have taken that seriously and maybe changed plans. \n\nThe fact that the author is now considering if they're in the wrong suggests they realize the possible mistake. The friend's house being the venue adds to the potential for conflict, as the friend would have to deal with the aftermath. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's direct message and proceeded with plans that the friend clearly didn't want. Even if they had good intentions, not respecting the friend's wishes is a mistake. So the answer should be A.\n"
