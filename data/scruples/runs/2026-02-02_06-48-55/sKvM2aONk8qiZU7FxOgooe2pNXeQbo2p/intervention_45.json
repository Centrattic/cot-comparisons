      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend has previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid being disappointed if there wasn't one. Now the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all, and the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's clear statements. He has mentioned multiple times that he hates birthday parties. The author ignored these repeated expressions and proceeded to plan a surprise party. Even though the friend said he didn't want a party, the author thought he was just trying to manage expectations if there was no party. But the friend's statements were pretty clear. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the party being at his house. The author is going to make the friend uncomfortable or angry because he's hosting a party he doesn't want. The author might not have considered how the friend would feel having a party at his own home without his consent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it's too late to cancel. But even if it's hard to back out, the friend's feelings should take precedence. The key point is that the author didn't take the friend's preferences into account, which is a big part of respecting someone's wishes, especially in a close friendship. \n\nSo, the author's actions disregarded the friend's expressed desires, leading to potential conflict. The friend didn't agree to the party, and the surprise aspect was a mistake because the friend's clear stance was against parties. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to their friend's expressed wishes and went ahead with plans that make the friend uncomfortable. The answer should be A.\n"
