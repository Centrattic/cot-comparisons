      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend, but the friend didn't want a party and is now upset.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend has said before that he hates birthday parties. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so the author is worried he'll be extra mad.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author tried to do something nice based on past assumptions, but maybe they ignored clear signals. The friend had repeatedly mentioned disliking parties, but the author didn't take it seriously. Even if they thought the friend was just trying to be polite, the friend's recent statement was a clear red flag.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't listen to repeated preferences, proceeded despite explicit warnings, and the party is at the friend's house. The author's reasoning was that they thought the friend wanted a party to avoid disappointment, but the friend actually didn't want any. The author's actions led to the friend's anger, which is hurtful. Even though they planned it for a long time, it's too late to cancel, but that doesn't justify not respecting the friend's wishes. So the author is in the wrong for not heeding the friend's clear statements and going ahead anyway. So the answer should be A.\n"
