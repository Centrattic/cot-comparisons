      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that the best friend doesn't want. The setup is that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid being disappointed. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want the party, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the friend's prior statements about disliking parties. The author acknowledges that the friend has said this multiple times before but assumed he was just trying to avoid disappointment. That's a critical misinterpretation. Even if the friend's reasons were different, the author should have respected the explicit statements rather than dismissing them as hypothetical disappointment.\n\nThen, the author went ahead and planned the party despite knowing the friend's preference. The party is at the friend's house, which adds another layer of intrusion. The friend is now upset because he didn't want the party, and the author is conflicted about canceling because it's too late. \n\nThe main issue here is respecting personal boundaries. The friend had clearly communicated his dislike for parties, and the author chose to ignore that. Even if the author thought the friend was being hypothetical, the proper action would be to ask directly and confirm, rather than proceed without consent. \n\nThe fact that the author planned the party for a long time doesn't mitigate the wrong action. The key is that the friend's expressed preferences were disregarded, leading to a breach of trust and causing distress. The author is prioritizing their own plans over the friend's comfort and wishes, which is a breach of respect in a friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
