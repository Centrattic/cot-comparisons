      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw a surprise party without considering their friend's explicit dislike of such events is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend clearly stated multiple times that he hates birthday parties. The author might have misunderstood, thinking their friend was just being modest or didn't want to hurt feelings. But the friend made it clear he wouldn't be happy if there was a party. The author proceeded anyway, even though the party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential for conflict. \n\nPlanning a party takes time and effort, but if the guest of honor is against it, that's a red flag. The author should have respected their friend's wishes instead of ignoring them. Even if the friend had a change of heart, it's the author's responsibility to check in and confirm. Since the friend was explicit in their dislike, the author's actions were inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
