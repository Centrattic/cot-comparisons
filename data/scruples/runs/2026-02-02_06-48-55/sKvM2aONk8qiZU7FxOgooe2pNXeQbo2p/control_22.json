      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend had expressed multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties, the author didn't take that into account, planning a party at the friend's house without considering his feelings. The author is now planning to go through with it despite knowing the friend is upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nThe friend's prior statements about disliking parties were clear. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend's recent message was explicit: he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal because he has to deal with it there. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel. But that doesn't excuse ignoring the friend's clear wishes. Surprise parties can be great, but if someone explicitly says they don't want them, then proceeding is inconsiderate. The author didn't respect the friend's preferences, which is a key point in the AITA context.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for not listening to the friend's repeated dislikes and going ahead with the party despite knowing he was upset. The main issue is respecting the friend's boundaries and preferences, which the author didn't do. The fact that it's a surprise might add to the problem because the friend didn't have a chance to voice his opposition before the party happened, but the author should have taken the friend's past statements seriously.\n"
