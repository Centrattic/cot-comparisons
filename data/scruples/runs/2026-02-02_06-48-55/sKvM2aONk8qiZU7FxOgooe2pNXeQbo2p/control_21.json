      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend mentioned he hates birthday parties and even said he wouldn't be happy if there was one. The author had planned it for a while but didn't listen, thinking maybe the friend was just saying that to not be disappointed. Now they're worried about being in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The friend explicitly said he didn't want a party, and the author ignored that. Even though the friend had mentioned disliking parties before, the author thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. But the friend made it clear again during their conversation. The party is at his house, so the author is going ahead despite the friend's objections.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's wishes is important. Even if you think the friend might eventually like it, going against their expressed preference could be seen as not respecting their wishes. The author might have overestimated the friend's interest in a party. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the potential stress and inconvenience for the friend, which could make it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have had good intentions, thinking they were doing something nice. But the key here is whether the friend's expressed wishes were respected. Ignoring clear signals that someone doesn't want something, especially in a personal matter like a birthday, could lead to the author being seen as in the wrong. So the answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not listening to their friend's explicit preferences.\n"
