      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend said they don't like parties and would be mad if there was one. \n\nFirst, the friend has expressed before not liking birthday parties. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now the friend is clearly stating they don't want a party. The party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation worse because the friend will have to be there against their will.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and consent. The author planned the party without considering the friend's explicit wishes. Even though they had planned it for a long time, the friend's current stance is clear. The author didn't check in after the initial mention, assuming the friend was just being polite. That assumption led to ignoring the friend's feelings.\n\nSurprise parties require the person to be unaware, but in this case, the friend is aware and unhappy. The author is going ahead despite knowing the friend's feelings. The friend's discomfort is valid, so the author didn't show respect for their wishes. Even if the party is too late to cancel, pushing forward without the friend's consent is problematic. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's clear statement and forced a celebration the friend doesn't want. Answer A.\n"
