      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend not wanting one. The friend clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house too, so he's in a position to be really upset.\n\nThe user thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but the friend actually hates birthday parties. The user planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel. So the question is, is the user in the wrong?\n\nWell, the friend had already expressed multiple times that he hates parties. Even if the user thought he was just saying that, it's still a clear indication. The user should have respected the friend's wishes. Throwing a party despite knowing the dislike seems inconsiderate. The fact that the party is at his house makes it even worse because it's his space and he's being forced into a situation he really dislikes. \n\nEven though the user put effort into planning, that's not a valid excuse if they ignored the friend's clear preferences. The key here is respecting the friend's boundaries. So yeah, the user is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
