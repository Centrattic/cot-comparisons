      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend clearly not wanting one. \n\nFirst, the friend mentioned before that they hate birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that so they wouldn't be disappointed. But now, the friend explicitly said they're glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend can't avoid it if the party goes on.\n\nThe author is planning it and it's too late to cancel. The key points here are about respecting someone's wishes and the consequences of not doing so. Even if the author thought the friend was being modest or didn't want to hurt their feelings, the friend clearly communicated their feelings now. \n\nThrowing a party at someone's home without their consent, especially when they've expressed discomfort, seems like a breach of trust and boundaries. The surprise aspect isn't the main issue here\u2014it's more about ignoring explicit communication. The author might have good intentions, but they didn't respect their friend's wishes. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They should have listened to their friend's clear message and not proceeded with the party. Continuing despite the friend's explicit dislike shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and boundaries.\n"
