      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that they threw a surprise party for their best friend, but the friend didn't want it and is now upset. The friend had mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now the friend is mad, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend had expressed dislike for birthday parties multiple times, but the author chose to ignore that. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the problem because the friend will have to deal with the aftermath and the surprise. The author was planning it for a long time, but it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the main issue here is that the friend clearly stated their preferences, and the author didn't take that into account. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend's actual feelings were clear. The author's actions disregarded the friend's expressed wishes, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, respecting someone's preferences, especially when they've been clear about them, is important. Even if the author had good intentions, not respecting the friend's wishes could be seen as a mistake. However, maybe there's a nuance where the author thought the friend was trying to be humble or didn't want to hurt the author's feelings. But the friend's explicit statements should be the main factor here. \n\nSince the friend is now upset and the party is at their house, the author's actions have caused harm despite their intentions. In AITA scenarios, intentions matter but so do the consequences and the consideration of others' feelings. The fact that the friend's preferences were repeated and the author ignored them points towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
