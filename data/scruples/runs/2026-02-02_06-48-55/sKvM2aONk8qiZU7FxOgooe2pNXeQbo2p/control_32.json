      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The friend has expressed multiple times that he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but now the friend is clearly upset and says he would be mad if there's a party at his house. The author has been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author ignore clear indications from the friend about his preferences? Even though the friend said he hates parties before, the author didn't take it seriously and assumed he was just being modest. But now, the friend has made it clear he doesn't want the party. \n\nSurprise parties can be nice, but they require consent from the person they're for. If the person doesn't want it, it's not a good idea. The author knew the friend's stance but went against it. Hosting a party at the friend's house without his consent adds to the problem because it's his space and he's not okay with it. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being kind by planning a surprise, but respecting the friend's wishes is more important. The friend's clear statement today shows he's not okay with it, so the author is in the wrong for not listening and proceeding anyway.\n"
