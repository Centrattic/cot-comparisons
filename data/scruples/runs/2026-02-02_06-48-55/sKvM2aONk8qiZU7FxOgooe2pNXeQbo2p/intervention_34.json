      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend, but the friend doesn't want a party and would be mad if there is one.\n\nFirst, the friend has expressed multiple times that he hates birthday parties. The author thought he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. But the friend made it clear again today, specifically saying he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so the author is going through with it despite this.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party? The user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the friend's repeated expressions of dislike for parties. Even if the author thought the friend was just being humble or not wanting to disappoint others, the friend made it clear again recently. The author continued planning even when they had a direct statement. The fact that the friend is the host here is important because it's his home and his comfort is key. \n\nSurprise parties can be stressful, and if the person being surprised doesn't want it, it's a problem. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but respecting the friend's wishes is more important. The fact that it's too late to cancel is a consequence, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for not respecting the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the author should have listened to the friend's clear statements. Even if the friend previously said he hated parties, the author should have taken it seriously. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
