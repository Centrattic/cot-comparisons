      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset about the party happening at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's clear past statements. If he's repeatedly said he hates parties, even if he thought he was just trying to avoid disappointment, the author should have taken those comments seriously. Surprise parties require consent, and the friend didn't give that. The author assumed wrongfully that the friend would be okay, which is a mistake. Even though they were excited and planned for a long time, the friend's feelings should take priority. The party is at his house, so the author is making him uncomfortable in his own space. So yes, the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's expressed preferences and proceeded without his consent. The answer is A.\n"
