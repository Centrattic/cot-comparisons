      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend now says he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal.\n\nFirst, the friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. But the friend actually didn't want a party and made that clear recently. The author ignored that and is going through with it because it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm. Even if the friend had said he didn't want a party, maybe the author should have respected that. Surprise parties are supposed to be a surprise, but if the person explicitly expressed not wanting one, especially multiple times, it's possible the author should have taken that more seriously. The fact that the friend was clear now makes it worse. The author might have thought they were doing a good thing, but not listening to the friend's expressed wishes could be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, the party is at his house, so the friend is stuck there. That's a lot of pressure. So the author might be in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's feelings and preferences.\n"
