      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend said they hate birthday parties. The friend also mentioned they'd be mad if there was a party, and it's at his house.\n\nFirst, the user planned the party and thought the friend was just saying they didn't want a party to avoid being disappointed. But the friend actually hates them. The user didn't listen and is going through with it because it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, did the user make a mistake by not considering the friend's feelings? The friend explicitly stated they don't like parties, which the user ignored. Even though the friend might have said it before, the user didn't take it seriously. Now the friend is upset, which the user caused. The user should have either not planned the party or talked to the friend before proceeding. Since they didn't, they're in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
