      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, who later said he didn't want a party because he hates them. The friend even mentioned he would be mad if there was one, which the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend had said before that he hates birthday parties. But the author thought maybe he said that just to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend clearly states he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is now questioning if they should cancel, but it's too late.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend had previously expressed dislike for parties, the author ignored those warnings, and now the friend is upset. Even though the author thought the friend was just trying not to be disappointed, the friend made it clear he didn't want a party. By not respecting his friend's wishes, the author is causing the friend distress. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, especially with close friends, respecting each other's boundaries is important. Even if the author had good intentions, not heeding the friend's clear preferences could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the friend is now angry and the party is at his house makes the situation worse because it's intruding on his space and causing him to be upset.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong. They didn't listen to their friend's explicit wishes and proceeded with something that's making their friend unhappy. Even if there was confusion earlier, the recent conversation made it clear, so the author should have adjusted their plans.\n"
