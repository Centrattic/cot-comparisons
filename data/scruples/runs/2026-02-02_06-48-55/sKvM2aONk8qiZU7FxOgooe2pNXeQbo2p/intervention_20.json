      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but when they asked the friend what he's doing for his birthday, the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so it's a problem. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points here. The author's intention was good\u2014they wanted to do something nice for their friend. However, the friend clearly expressed his dislike for parties, which the author might have overlooked. The friend even said he would be angry if there was a party, and the event is at his home, making the situation more problematic because the guest of honor is upset and has to deal with the aftermath, even if the party is at his place.\n\nThe author mentions that they've been planning this for a long time and it's too late to cancel. But the main issue here is respecting the friend's expressed wishes. Even if the friend said he hates parties before, the author should have taken that into account. Maybe the friend changed his mind or was more serious this time. The author might have misinterpreted the friend's previous statements as just being polite or not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, but the friend clearly communicated his feelings in this specific instance.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to do something nice, and maybe they thought the party would make the friend happy despite his past comments. But the friend's direct statement that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one suggests that the author didn't listen to his clear wishes. The friend's comfort and preferences should take precedence here, especially since the party is at his house. Forcing a party on someone who doesn't want it can be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the planning effort.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's explicit wishes. The friend's feelings and desires are more important than the effort put into planning. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
