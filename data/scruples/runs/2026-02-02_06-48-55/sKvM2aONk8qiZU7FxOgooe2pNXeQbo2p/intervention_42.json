      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The key points here are that the author planned a surprise party for their best friend, but the friend explicitly said they don't like birthday parties and would be mad if there was one. The author had previously thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had mentioned hating parties before, but the author dismissed those statements, thinking they were just trying to manage expectations. However, when directly asked, the friend clearly stated he didn't want a party and would be angry. The party is at his house, making the situation worse because he's stuck there.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's failure to listen to explicit requests. Even if the friend had been vague before, the recent conversation was clear. The author might argue they wanted to make the friend happy, but the friend's explicit statement should have taken precedence. Planning a party despite knowing it's unwanted shows a lack of respect for the friend's preferences. The author's justification of \"it's too late to cancel\" doesn't mitigate the wrongness because they should have heeded the friend's clear wishes earlier.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. They didn't take the friend's feelings seriously, leading to a situation that would upset the friend. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
