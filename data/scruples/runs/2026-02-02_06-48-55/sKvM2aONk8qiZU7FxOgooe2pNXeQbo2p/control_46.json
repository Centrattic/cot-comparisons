      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. So, the person planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the planner thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is clearly upset and would be mad if there's a party, especially since it's at his house.\n\nHmm, the key points here are that the friend had told the planner multiple times he didn't like parties, but the planner ignored those statements. Even though the friend might have said that to avoid being disappointed, the planner should have taken those statements seriously. They were planning for a long time and now it's too late to cancel. The party is at his house, which makes the situation worse because the friend has to be there and can't just leave. \n\nSo, the planner didn't listen to the friend's clear preferences. Even if the friend said he didn't mind, the planner should have respected that. Surprise parties are about the person being surprised, but in this case, the friend would be genuinely upset. The planner's actions are causing distress to the friend, which isn't a good outcome. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's expressed wishes, leading to a situation where the friend is forced to be in a place he's uncomfortable. The answer should be A.\n"
