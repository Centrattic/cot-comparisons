      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend when the friend clearly didn't want it. The friend said he hates parties and didn't want one, but the person didn't take it seriously, thinking maybe he just didn't want to disappoint them. Now they're stuck with planning it and can't cancel.\n\nHmm. So, first, the friend had expressed dislike for birthday parties before. The author might have known this but ignored it. Even when the friend directly said he would be mad if there was a party, the author still went ahead. That's a problem. The party is at his house, so the friend is in a tough spot. The author didn't listen to clear signals. Even if the friend had said he was okay with it, the author still went against his wishes. Planning a party is a big commitment, but if the person it's for doesn't want it, it's not right. The answer is probably A. They should have respected the friend's wishes instead of assuming he was lying. Surprise parties can be nice, but when the person doesn't want them, it's inconsiderate. The author is in the wrong.\n"
