      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The author is planning a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but the friend has expressed before that he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend explicitly said he wouldn't want a party and would be mad if there was one, especially since it's at his house. The author is going ahead with the party despite this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend has a history of stating he dislikes parties, but maybe the author thought the friend was being modest or wanted to avoid pressure. Then, the friend made it clear he doesn't want a party. The author might have ignored a clear refusal, even though planning is already done. \n\nThe main issue here is about respecting someone's wishes. Even if the author thought they were doing something nice, if the other person explicitly said they don't want it, especially multiple times, the author should have listened. The fact that the friend said he would be mad if there was a party is a strong indicator that this is against his wishes. \n\nSurprise parties require keeping secrets, and if the person being surprised clearly states they don't want a party, the organiser should respect that. The author might have dismissed the friend's previous statements as not serious, but now that it's clear, proceeding would be ignoring those boundaries. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's discomfort or anger. The author might have overstepped by not acknowledging the friend's clear feelings now, despite past misinterpretations. Even if it's too late to cancel, the author's actions are causing harm, which is the main point in AITA questions. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's current explicit wishes, even though there were previous hints. The friend's direct statement should have been the clear signal to stop.\n"
