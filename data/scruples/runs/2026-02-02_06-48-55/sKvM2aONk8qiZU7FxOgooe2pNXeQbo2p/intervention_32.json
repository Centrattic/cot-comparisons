      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a surprise birthday party at the friend's house. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend clearly says he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is conflicted because they've been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's previous statements about disliking parties and the current explicit statement that he doesn't want a party. The author didn't listen to those warnings, assuming maybe the friend was just being modest or wanted to avoid disappointment. But the friend made it clear he's not okay with it now.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Surprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the person liking surprises. Since the friend had already expressed dislike for parties, the author should have respected that, even if they thought the friend was just being polite. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem because it's his space, and the friend would be uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they thought the friend might be saying he hates parties to avoid disappointment, but that's an assumption. The friend's clarification today was direct, and the author is still proceeding. That seems like ignoring the friend's current wishes. Even if the party is too late to cancel, the author should have considered the friend's feelings and maybe found another way to celebrate without the party.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's explicit wishes and proceeded with something the friend clearly didn't want. The answer is A.\n"
