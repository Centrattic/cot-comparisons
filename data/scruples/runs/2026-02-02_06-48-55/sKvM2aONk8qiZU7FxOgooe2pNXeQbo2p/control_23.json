      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party.\n\nThe situation is that the author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday. The friend had previously said he hated birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, when the author asked what the friend was doing for his birthday, the friend expressed that he wouldn't be happy if there was a party, especially since it's at his house. The author is now conflicted because they've been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the friend has a history of disliking parties, the author ignored those previous statements, and the friend is now upset. The author is wondering if they're wrong for not listening and going ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was aware of the friend's preferences. The story mentions the friend said he hated birthday parties \"many times before,\" but the author thought he was just trying not to be disappointed. That seems like a misunderstanding on the author's part. The friend wasn't trying to hide his feelings but was clear, and the author misinterpreted those statements as a way to manage expectations.\n\nThen, the friend explicitly told the author today that he would be mad if there was a party. The author is now planning to go through with it despite this. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's potential discomfort or anger because he has to host a party he doesn't want.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they've been planning it for a long time and can't cancel now. But the main issue here is respecting the friend's expressed wishes. Even if the author thought the friend was trying to avoid disappointment, the friend has clarified now that he's against it. Continuing to proceed without considering the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's feelings and clear communication are important here. Ignoring someone's explicit statement about not wanting a party, especially when they've had previous conversations about it, shows a lack of respect for their boundaries. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't listen to their friend's wishes, leading to a situation where the friend is upset despite being clear.\n"
