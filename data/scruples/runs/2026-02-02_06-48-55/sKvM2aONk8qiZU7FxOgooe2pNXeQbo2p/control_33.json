      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who planned the surprise party is in the wrong. They had a best friend's birthday coming up and decided to throw a surprise party. The friend said he didn't want a party and if there was one, he'd be mad, especially since it's at his house. The person planning it knew the friend had said he hated birthday parties before but thought maybe he was just being modest or didn't want to disappoint.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting the friend's wishes and prior statements. The friend had expressed multiple times he hates parties, so maybe the person planning it should have listened. But they thought maybe he was just saying that. However, the friend was clear in the latest conversation that he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The planner didn't take that into account and went ahead with planning. \n\nNow, is that the wrong thing to do? Well, surprise parties can be tricky because they're supposed to be a surprise, but if the person has repeatedly stated they don't want them, and then the planner ignores that, even after the friend explicitly says he doesn't want it, that seems like a problem. The planner might have misread the friend's previous comments as just being shy or not wanting to seem ungrateful, but when the friend clearly states his opposition, the planner should respect that. Also, since the party is at his house, it's on his turf, which could add to the frustration. \n\nI think the planner made a mistake by not listening to the friend's clear wishes, especially after he made it known again. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
