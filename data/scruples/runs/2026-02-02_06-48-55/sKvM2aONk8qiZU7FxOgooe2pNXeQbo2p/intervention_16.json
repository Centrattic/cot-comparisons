      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend despite the friend having previously expressed dislike for parties. The friend now says he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, especially since it's at his house.\n\nFirst, the author planned a surprise party, assuming the friend was just saying he didn't want a party to avoid disappointment. The friend had said he hates birthday parties multiple times before, but the author didn't take it seriously. Now, the author is conflicted because they've already planned it and are too late to cancel.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend clearly communicated his preferences before. Even if it was a surprise, the author should have trusted those statements. A surprise party can be great, but if the person doesn't want a party at all, it's a problem. The fact that the friend is upset now because he didn't want a party shows the author didn't respect his wishes. Also, the party is at his house, making it even more awkward. The author didn't ask for permission or confirm the friend's current feelings, even though the friend had expressed dislike before. So, the author didn't listen to their friend's clear preferences, leading to the friend's anger. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
