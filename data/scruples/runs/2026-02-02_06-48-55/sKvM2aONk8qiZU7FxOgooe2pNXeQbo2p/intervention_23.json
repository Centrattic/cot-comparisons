      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend's previous statements about hating birthdays. \n\nFirst, the friend has clearly expressed multiple times that he dislikes birthday parties. The author, however, thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. That's a common misunderstanding, but the friend's recent message was pretty clear: if there's a party, he'll be mad. The party is at his house too, which adds to the potential for conflict.\n\nNow, the author has been planning for a long time and it's too late to cancel. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not listening. The key points here are respect for the friend's wishes and the impact of the action. Even if the intention was good, deliberately going against someone's explicit preferences, especially when they've mentioned hating something, can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe fact that the friend is a close one (best friend) makes it even more important to heed their feelings. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but if the friend is genuinely upset, then the action, while well-intentioned, was not considerate of the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, even though it's a surprise and the author might have thought they were helping, not respecting the friend's stated preference and going ahead anyway seems to be in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
