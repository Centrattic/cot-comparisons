      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, their best friend's birthday is coming up, and they planned a surprise party at his house. The friend said he hates birthday parties and if there was a party, he'd be mad. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong for not listening and going through with the party.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The author mentions the friend has \"hated birthday parties\" multiple times before. The friend even explicitly said that if there was a party, he'd be mad. The party is at his house, which adds to the problem because the guest of honor is now in charge of the event and might feel trapped. \n\nEven if the author thought the friend was just trying to manage expectations, it's still important to clarify. The friend made it clear that parties aren't his thing, so the author should have respected that. Planning a party without the person's consent, especially when they've expressed strong preferences against it, seems like a breach of trust. The fact that the party is at his house makes it worse because it could make him uncomfortable in his own space. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not canceling because it's too late might be valid in terms of logistics, but that doesn't negate the friend's feelings. The main issue is not the effort put into planning but whether the friend actually wants it. The author might have assumed they were doing a nice thing, but ignoring the friend's explicit wishes shows a lack of respect for his boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they went against the friend's clear stated preferences and didn't seek proper consent, leading to a situation that could cause the friend distress.\n"
