      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend. The friend didn't want a party and expressed that clearly, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the party is at the friend's house, and the friend is going to be mad.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times. The author should have taken that as a strong hint. Even if the friend might have been hoping for a party, the clear statements against it should have been a red flag. The author didn't confirm the friend's wishes again, assuming maybe the friend was being humble or wanted to avoid hurt feelings. But in doing so, the author went ahead with the party without proper communication.\n\nSurprise parties can be a good idea when the recipient actually wants them. The friend made it clear he didn't. The author's decision to proceed despite this could be seen as ignoring the friend's expressed preferences. Even if the party is already planned, the fact that it's at the friend's house makes it more personal and intrusive. The friend's reaction is likely to be strong because it's not just any location.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But that's a bit of a stretch. If someone repeatedly states they don't want a party, it's more reasonable to respect that rather than assume they're lying. The author's actions show a lack of communication and respect for the friend's boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to their friend's clear preferences and proceeded with the party despite knowing it might upset him.\n"
