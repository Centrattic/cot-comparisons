      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing an unwanted party. The situation is that they planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but when they asked the friend about his plans, he clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid being disappointed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the author knew the friend didn't like parties, continued to plan one anyway, and now the friend is upset. Even though the author had already planned it and it's too late to cancel, they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, did the author make a mistake? Well, the friend had expressed his feelings multiple times about disliking parties. The author might have overlooked those signals, thinking maybe the friend was just making excuses. But when the friend directly stated he would be mad if there was a party, that's a clear warning. The author chose to ignore that and proceed, which could be seen as not respecting the friend's wishes. Even if the party is already planned, the intention to go ahead despite knowing it would upset the friend is problematic. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to do something nice. Maybe they thought the friend would appreciate the effort. However, the friend clearly communicated his preference. So the author didn't listen to explicit feedback. In relationships, especially with friends, respecting their expressed preferences is important. Even if the author thought the friend was being modest, the direct statement should have been taken seriously. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong for not listening to the friend's clear wishes and proceeding with the party despite knowing it would upset him.\n"
