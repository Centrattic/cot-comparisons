      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw a surprise party without considering their friend's feelings is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend repeatedly said he hates birthday parties, but the organizer thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset because the party is happening at his house, which adds to the problem.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and respect. The friend had clearly expressed his dislike for parties multiple times. Even if the organizer thought the friend was just being modest or trying to set low expectations, ignoring those clear statements shows a lack of attention to the friend's preferences. Planning a surprise party despite knowing the friend's feelings is a breach of trust and respect. \n\nSurprise parties can be nice, but they rely heavily on the person's willingness to have one. Since the friend didn't want it and is now furious, the organizer didn't honor his expressed wishes. The fact that it's at his house makes it even worse because he's forced to host something he's against. \n\nThe organizer might think they were doing something nice, but the friend's repeated statements should have been a clear sign. The main issue here is not misunderstanding but ignoring the friend's feelings. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party despite the friend's clear objections.\n"
