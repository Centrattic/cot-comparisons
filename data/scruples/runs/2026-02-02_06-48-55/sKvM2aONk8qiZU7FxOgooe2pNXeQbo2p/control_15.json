      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that their best friend's birthday is coming up, and they planned a surprise party at his house. The key point here is that the friend has expressed before that he hates birthday parties. But the user thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. However, when they talked today, the friend clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. \n\nNow, the user is conflicted because they've been planning this for a long time and it's too late to cancel. The question is if the user is in the wrong by not listening and going ahead with the party.\n\nLet me break this down. The friend has a history of disliking parties, and even though he might have said it before, the user didn't take it seriously. The friend explicitly told them today that he doesn't want the party. So even if the user thought he was just saying that before, he made it clear now. \n\nThe user's action is not respecting the friend's expressed wishes. Even if they had good intentions, organizing a party at the friend's house without considering his feelings and preferences could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's house is the location, so having a party there against his will would make him uncomfortable or upset. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned that it's too late to cancel, but that doesn't excuse the decision. If they knew earlier that the friend didn't want a party, they should have respected that. The fact that they continued despite the friend's clear communication today suggests they didn't take his feelings into account properly.\n\nSo, the user's mistake was not listening to the friend's repeated preferences and not checking in more thoroughly. Even though it's a surprise, surprises can be problematic if they conflict with someone's wishes. The friend's right to have his preferences respected is important in a friendship. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's feelings, leading to a situation where the friend is likely to be upset.\n"
