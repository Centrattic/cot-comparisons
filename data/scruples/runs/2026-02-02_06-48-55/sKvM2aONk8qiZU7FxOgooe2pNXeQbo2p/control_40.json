      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all, and the author is planning to go through with it despite knowing this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are that the author was aware of the friend's dislike for parties but still proceeded with planning. Even though the friend had said it before, the author dismissed those statements as just a way to not be disappointed if there was no party. That seems like a misinterpretation. The friend clearly communicated his preference not to have a party, and the author didn't take that seriously enough. \n\nSurprise parties require some level of deception because the friend is supposed to be unaware. However, the friend's explicit statement today about not wanting a party and being mad if there was one is a red flag. The author should have respected that and canceled. The fact that the party is at his house makes it even more personal, and the friend's discomfort would be justified. \n\nThe author argues that it's too late to cancel, but that's more about their own effort than the friend's feelings. The main issue is not considering the friend's feelings and oversteering the plan despite clear indications of disinterest. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
