      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The author planned a party, but the friend clearly said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has mentioned before he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the author is considering whether to proceed with the party despite the friend's explicit wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend explicitly stated he doesn't want a party, and he's made that clear multiple times. The author, however, didn't listen and went ahead with planning it. The party is at the friend's house, so it's a big issue because the friend will be there and probably upset.\n\nThe main issue here is respecting the friend's wishes. Even if the author thought the friend might be saying he didn't want a party to avoid disappointment, the friend's recent statement was clear and direct. The author should have prioritized the friend's expressed preferences over their own assumptions. Planning a party at this stage is too late to cancel, but that doesn't excuse proceeding against the friend's clear wishes. The author's actions could lead to hurting the friend's feelings and damaging the friendship. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's explicit requests, even if they thought they were doing something nice. The mistake was not communicating properly and not respecting the friend's feelings.\n"
