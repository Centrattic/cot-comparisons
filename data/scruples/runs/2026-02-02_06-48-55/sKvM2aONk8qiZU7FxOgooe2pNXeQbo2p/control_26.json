      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned the surprise party is in the wrong. The situation is that they threw a party for their best friend's birthday, but the friend expressed not wanting a party. The key points here are the friend's previous statements and the current situation.\n\nFirst, the friend has said before that he hates birthday parties. The planner thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. But now, when the party is planned, the friend is clearly upset. The planner is asking if they're at fault for not listening and going ahead with the party despite the friend's wishes.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the planner should have respected the friend's expressed preference. Even if the planner thought the friend was being hypothetical, the friend made it clear this time. The planner might have misinterpreted past statements, but the current communication was explicit. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's discomfort. \n\nThe planner might argue they had good intentions, but intention vs. impact matters here. The friend is clearly upset, which suggests the planner should have listened. The fact that the party is already planned and can't be canceled now doesn't absolve the planner of responsibility. \n\nAlso, in friendships, respecting boundaries is important. Even if the planner thought they were doing something nice, not considering the friend's clear current feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A (in the wrong) because they ignored the friend's direct expression of not wanting a party, even if they had planned it for a while.\n"
