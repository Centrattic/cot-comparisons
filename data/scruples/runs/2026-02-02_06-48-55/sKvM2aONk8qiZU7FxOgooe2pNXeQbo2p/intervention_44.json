      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing a surprise birthday party despite their best friend expressing dislike for parties.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person planned a surprise party at their friend's house. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just trying not to be disappointing if there was no party. However, when they talked today, the friend clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is too late to cancel now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The friend's preferences were communicated multiple times. The author might have dismissed those preferences as the friend trying to be polite. But when the friend directly stated his opposition, the author still went ahead. Even though the party is already planned, the friend's current stance is clear. The author didn't take the friend's feelings into account, which could lead to the friend being upset. \n\nThe responsibility here lies in respecting the friend's wishes. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying things before, the recent conversation was explicit. Continuing with the party despite that might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
