      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person plans a surprise birthday party for their best friend at the friend's house. The friend mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the planner thought he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend is upset and says he would be mad if there's a party. The planner is wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party.\n\nHmm. Well, the friend clearly expressed dislike for birthday parties multiple times. Even though the planner thought maybe he was just trying to avoid disappointment, the friend's direct statement now is that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so he has control over it. The planner didn't check in again after those previous statements, assuming the friend's feelings were just hypothetical. \n\nBut the key here is that the friend explicitly told them he's against the party. The planner ignored that and went ahead. Even if they thought they knew the friend's preferences, the friend made it clear now. So by not respecting his current wishes, the planner is overstepping. The fact that they've been planning for a long time and it's too late to cancel doesn't excuse not listening to the friend's clear stance. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't respect the friend's expressed feelings and proceeded despite knowing the potential for conflict. Even if the intention was good, the outcome is causing harm, which makes it their fault.\n"
