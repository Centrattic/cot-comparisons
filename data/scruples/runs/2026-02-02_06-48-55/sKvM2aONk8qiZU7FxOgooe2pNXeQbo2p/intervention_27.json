      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a surprise birthday party at the friend's house. The friend had mentioned before hating parties, but the author thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. Now, when they talked again, the friend clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is planning to go ahead with the party despite this.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting boundaries and communication. The friend had expressed his dislike for parties multiple times. The author might have thought the friend was just saying that, but the friend now clarifies he's not okay with it. Even though the author has been planning it for a long time, the friend's current explicit statement should be a red flag. \n\nThe key issue is that the author is not respecting the friend's current wishes. Even if the party is at the friend's house, by proceeding, the author is disregarding the friend's feelings. The friend might have felt disrespected or not listened to. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, which makes sense because the friend's explicit refusal should be honored. The author's insistence despite knowing the friend's feelings is the problem here. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
