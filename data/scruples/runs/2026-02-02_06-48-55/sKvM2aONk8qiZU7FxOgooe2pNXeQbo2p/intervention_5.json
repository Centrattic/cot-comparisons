      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The author planned a party without the friend's explicit approval, even though the friend had mentioned multiple times he doesn't like parties. The author might have ignored those clear indications. Even if the friend was being \"nice\" by not pushing back, the author should have respected his stated preferences. \n\nSurprise parties can be a good idea if the person actually wants them, but in this case, the friend made his dislike known. The author's reasoning that the friend just said he hates parties to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one is a bit of a stretch. It's more likely the friend was being honest, and the author didn't take that seriously. \n\nAlso, since the party is at the friend's house, that adds to the stress and possible intrusion. The author might have overstepped by not checking in more thoroughly. The fact that they've been planning for a long time doesn't excuse not listening to the friend's clear preferences. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's wishes despite previous warnings.\n"
