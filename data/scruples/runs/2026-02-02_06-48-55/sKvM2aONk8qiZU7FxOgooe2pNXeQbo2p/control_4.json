      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend not wanting one. The friend clearly said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but the friend actually meant it.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about respecting someone's wishes. The friend had expressed multiple times that he doesn't like parties, but the author ignored that and went ahead. Even though the author had planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel, the main issue is whether they should have listened to their friend's preferences.\n\nIn relationships, especially with close friends, communication is important. If someone explicitly states their preferences, even if you think they're just being modest or trying to avoid hurt feelings, you should probably take them seriously. The author might have misunderstood the friend's previous comments, but the friend was clear in the recent conversation. \n\nSo the author's action was based on their assumption that the friend was just trying to manage expectations. However, the friend clearly stated they didn't want a party and would be angry. The author's decision to proceed despite that seems to disregard the friend's expressed wishes, which could lead to conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's explicit statement about not wanting a party. Even if they thought otherwise before, the recent conversation should have been a clear sign to stop or at least have a conversation. So, answer A makes sense here.\n"
