      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday, but when they asked the friend, he said he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend had mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault for not listening and going ahead anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had previously expressed dislike for parties, but the author might have dismissed it as him not wanting to let them down if there was no party. However, the friend clearly stated his preference this time, being specific that he doesn't want a party and would be upset. The party is at his house, which adds to the problem because it's his space and he's not on board. The author has already planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. Surprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the recipient not knowing. But if someone has consistently expressed a dislike for such events, the friend should have taken that into account. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying he didn't want a party, the friend's recent explicit statement makes it clear he does not want it. The fact that the party is at his house is a big factor because it's his home, and he's not comfortable with the idea. The author is proceeding despite knowing this, which could lead to the friend feeling disrespected or not heard. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have good intentions, wanting to make the friend feel celebrated. They might have ignored the friend's previous statements, thinking the friend would be okay with it. But the friend's recent clarification is a strong indicator that he doesn't want this. The author's decision to go ahead could be seen as disregarding his current wishes, which is a breach of trust and respect for the friend's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's direct and clear refusal. Even if they had ignored past comments, the friend's recent statement should have been a clear sign. Proceeding with the party against his explicit wishes is a mistake.\n"
