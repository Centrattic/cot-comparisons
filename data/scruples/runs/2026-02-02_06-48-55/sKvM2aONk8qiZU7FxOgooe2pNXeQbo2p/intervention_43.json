      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The author planned a party for their best friend's birthday, but the friend expressed not wanting a party. The friend mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times, but the author thought they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the party is at the friend's house, and the friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had clearly stated multiple times that they don't like birthday parties. The author, however, thought the friend was just saying that to manage expectations if there was no party. The author went ahead and planned the party despite these clear statements.\n\nThe friend's statement was explicit: they said they're glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author ignored these direct warnings. Even though the author had been planning for a long time, the friend's feelings and preferences were clear. The surprise party is at the friend's house, which adds another layer because the friend has to be present, making the situation more awkward and potentially hurtful.\n\nThe main issue here is respecting the friend's expressed wishes. The author didn't listen to the friend's clear communication, which led to the friend being upset. While the author might have thought they were doing something nice, they disregarded the friend's feelings. The friend's dislike for parties was not a new revelation; it was mentioned multiple times. The author should have taken that seriously instead of dismissing it as just a hypothetical scenario.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative because the friend felt disrespected. The author's actions led to the friend's anger, which is a significant consequence. The fact that it's too late to cancel doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for not respecting the friend's wishes.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not listening to the friend's clear expressions of dislike for parties and proceeding with the party against their wishes. The answer should be A.\n"
