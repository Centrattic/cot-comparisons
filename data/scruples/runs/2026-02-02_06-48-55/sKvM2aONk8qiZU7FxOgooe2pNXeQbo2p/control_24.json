      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned a surprise party for their best friend is wrong for not heeding the friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned multiple times that he dislikes birthday parties. The person planning the party thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was, especially since the party is at his house.\n\nThe key points here are prior communication and the friend's clear current stance. The planner didn't take the friend's past statements seriously enough. Even though they had a conversation where the friend made it clear, the planner is going ahead with the party, which is at the friend's house. This situation shows a lack of respect for the friend's expressed wishes, leading to a potential conflict. The planner's actions could cause harm to their friendship by ignoring the friend's feelings. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
