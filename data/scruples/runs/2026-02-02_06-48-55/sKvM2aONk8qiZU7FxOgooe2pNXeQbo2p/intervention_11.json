      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but the friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the author is caught between going ahead with the party they've planned for a long time or canceling it, but it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether the author ignored clear warnings from their friend. The friend stated he doesn't want a party, and he's made this known multiple times. The author, however, decided to proceed, thinking the friend might have been insincere before. \n\nIn terms of social norms, a surprise party without the person's consent, especially when they've expressed disinterest, can be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have assumed that the friend was just being modest or wanted to avoid disappointment, but the friend's statements were clear and repeated. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds another layer because the friend is in their own space and might feel even more uncomfortable or betrayed.\n\nAnother angle is the effort the author put into planning. They've been working on this for a long time, which they mention as a reason not to cancel. But when someone's direct wishes are ignored, the effort might not justify the outcome. The friend's feelings here are paramount. If the party goes ahead and the friend is upset, the author might end up damaging the friendship over a misunderstanding.\n\nI should also consider if there's a way to salvage the situation. Maybe the author could still adjust the plans, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The act of proceeding despite clear opposition indicates a lack of respect for the friend's preferences. Even if the author's intention was good, the execution was flawed. The friend's right to have their wishes respected is important here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's explicit wishes. The key point is the friend's clear communication and the author's failure to honor that, leading to potential harm to the friendship. So the answer should be A.\n"
