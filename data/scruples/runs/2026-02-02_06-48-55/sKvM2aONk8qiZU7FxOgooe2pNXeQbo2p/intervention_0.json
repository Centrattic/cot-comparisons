      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party at their friend's house despite the friend expressing dislike for parties. The key points here are the friend's previous statements about hating birthdays and the author's decision to proceed.\n\nFirst, the friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties. The author, however, thought those comments were just to avoid disappointment if there was no party. But the friend clarified today that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, which complicates things because the friend might have to deal with it.\n\nThe author planned this for a long time and thinks it's too late to cancel. But the main issue is respecting the friend's wishes. Even if the author thought the friend was being polite, the friend clearly stated his feelings now. It's a situation where the friend's preferences should be prioritized, especially since it's his house and his birthday. The author didn't listen to the friend's explicit statement and is going ahead, which could lead to a hurtful situation. So, the author is in the wrong for not heeding the friend's direct input and proceeding despite knowing the potential for conflict.\n"
