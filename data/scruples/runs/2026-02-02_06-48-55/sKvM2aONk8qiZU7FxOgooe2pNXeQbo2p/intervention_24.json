      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party when their best friend clearly didn't want one. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at his house. The friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there wasn't a party. Now, when they talked privately, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be very mad if there was one. The party is already set, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for not canceling.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The friend had mentioned not liking parties before, but the author didn't take that seriously enough. Even though the friend said he didn't want a party, the author proceeded anyway, planning it for a long time. Now, the friend is upset and will be even more so if the party happens.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they ignored clear signs and direct communication from their friend. Even if the friend had a history of saying he didn't want parties, the author should have respected that preference. Planning a surprise party without considering his feelings and boundaries shows a lack of respect. Also, the party is at his house, which makes the situation worse because he's forced to be there. The author should have listened and maybe opted for a different way to celebrate. So, the answer is A.\n"
