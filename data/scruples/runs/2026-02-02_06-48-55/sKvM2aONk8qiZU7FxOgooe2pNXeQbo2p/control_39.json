      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend saying he doesn't want one. \n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend clearly stated he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, even though the party is at his house.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend previously expressed dislike for parties, the author ignored those feelings, and the party is at the friend's house which adds to the friend's potential anger. The author also says it's too late to cancel, which shows they're sticking with the plan despite the friend's current stance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's clear statements now indicate he doesn't want the party. Even if the author thought the friend was just being modest before, the recent conversation changes things. The author should have respected the friend's current wishes. Throwing the party against his explicit request seems inconsiderate, especially since it's at his house. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
