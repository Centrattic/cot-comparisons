      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party when their best friend explicitly said he doesn't want one.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned before disliking birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now, the friend clearly states he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so that's a big issue.\n\nThe author planned this for a long time but it's too late to cancel. The key points here are: the friend's explicit statement against parties, the fact that the party is at his house, and the author not heeding clear warnings. Even if the friend had said it before, the recent direct communication should have been a red flag.\n\nRespecting someone's wishes, especially about their own home and comfort, seems important. The author might think they were doing something nice, but ignoring clear boundaries is a problem. Even if the intention was good, the outcome is likely to cause hurt. So yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
