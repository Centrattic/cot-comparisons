      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend clearly not wanting one. The key points here are that the friend has mentioned hating birthday parties before, and now he explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The author didn't listen and is going ahead with the party they've planned for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's preferences. If the friend has expressed multiple times that they don't like parties, even if the author thought it was just to avoid disappointment, it's still a red flag. The friend's recent statement is clear and direct. The author should have taken that seriously. The fact that the party is at the friend's house makes it even more intrusive because the friend will be forced to deal with it there, which could make them really upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, maybe thinking the friend would appreciate a surprise. But the friend made it clear they don't want it, so continuing despite that shows a lack of respect for the friend's wishes. The author's justification that it's too late to cancel might not excuse the decision, especially since they knew the friend's feelings early on. \n\nSo, the main issue is respecting the friend's expressed wishes. Even if the intention was good, the action was inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
