      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the person planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but when they asked the friend what he was doing, the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so he'll be there, and the friend has mentioned hating birthday parties before. The person is now wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party, even though it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author ignored clear signs from their friend about disliking parties. The friend has stated multiple times before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so the friend can't easily leave, which could make the situation uncomfortable or hurtful.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the friend might be trying to avoid disappointment, so they proceeded. But the friend's recent statement seems more direct. The question is whether the author should have taken that into account. Even if the party is already planned and can't be canceled, the author is still going against the friend's clear wishes. This could be seen as inconsiderate, as the friend doesn't want the attention or celebration. Surprise parties can be stressful, especially if the person isn't prepared for it. The fact that the friend is already upset and the party is at his house adds to the problem because he can't escape it. \n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't realize how much the friend dislikes parties. But considering the friend has mentioned it multiple times before, it's hard to argue that the author wasn't aware. The key point is that the author didn't listen to the friend's recent direct statement, which was a clear sign. Even if they had good intentions, the outcome could be negative for the friend. The author might be in the wrong because they proceeded despite the friend's explicit wishes. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
