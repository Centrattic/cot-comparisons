      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise party for a best friend, but the friend expressed disapproval.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But when they talked today, the friend clearly didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one, especially since it's at his house.\n\nThe author has been planning for a long time and it's too late to cancel. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not listening.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's prior statements and the recent confirmation. The author should have taken the prior statements seriously. Even if the friend said he didn't want a party before, the author should have respected that. Maybe the friend meant it. The author might have ignored clear signs and went ahead anyway, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the party is at the friend's house makes it worse because it's violating the friend's space and wishes. So the author probably is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
