      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The author planned the party at the friend's house, but the friend clearly said they hate birthday parties and would be mad if there was one.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and respect. The friend has expressed multiple times that they dislike parties, but the author thought they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. But the friend actually meant it and the party is at their house now. The author is now considering whether they're at fault for not listening and proceeding anyway.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not taking the friend's previous statements seriously. Even if the friend might have been trying to avoid letting the author down before, the author should have confirmed their feelings more directly. Planning a party at the friend's house without ensuring their comfort is a big oversight. Also, the fact that the friend is now upset and the party is at their home adds to the problem because it's their space being used without their consent for something they don't want.\n\nThe author's reasoning that they thought the friend didn't mind is a stretch. If someone repeatedly says they hate something, it's reasonable to believe they mean it. The author's decision to go ahead despite the friend's explicit statement today shows a lack of respect for their feelings. Even if it's too late to cancel now, the initial action of planning without confirmation was wrong. So, the answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
