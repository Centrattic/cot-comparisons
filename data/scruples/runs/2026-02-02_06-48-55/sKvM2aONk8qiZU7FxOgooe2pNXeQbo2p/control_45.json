      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted party. The situation is that they planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at his house, but when they asked him about it, he expressed that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're worried about going ahead with the party they've planned for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned a surprise party without confirming properly. The friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party. Even though he's mentioned before that he hates parties, the author thought he was just trying to be humble or not set expectations. But here, the friend was clear this time. The party is at his house, so it's a significant location, and the friend's discomfort is directly related to the event being held there.\n\nThe moral aspect here is about respecting someone's wishes, even if you think they're just being modest. If the friend has expressed his dislike for parties multiple times, the author should have taken those into account. Even if the author thought the friend might be saying that to avoid being disappointed, the direct statement today was a clear indication. The author didn't take that seriously and is now planning to proceed anyway.\n\nAnother point is the effort invested. The author has been planning for a long time and finds it too late to cancel. But the friend's current explicit statement overrides previous planning. The harm caused by making the friend uncomfortable at his own home is more significant than the effort put into planning. Also, the surprise element being at the friend's house makes it even more intrusive since the friend isn't expecting it and might feel pressured.\n\nSo, the author didn't respect the friend's current wishes despite knowing his past preferences. The fact that the friend is now clearly against it, the author's decision to go ahead shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
