      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party without considering their friend's explicit request not to have one.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties multiple times. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. But the friend then confirmed today that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so he's in a position to be upset about it. The author is now planning it and can't cancel now.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend clearly expressed his dislike for parties, the author didn't listen, and the party is now going ahead despite the friend's wishes. Even if the author thought the friend was just being modest before, the latest communication was clear. The author should have respected that. The fact that it's at the friend's house adds to the potential for the friend to feel disrespected. The author's actions ignored the friend's feelings and preferences, which is a breach of trust and consideration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
