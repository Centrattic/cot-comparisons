      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. Let me break this down. The friend has previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointing them if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is upset and the author is considering going ahead with the party even though it's at his house.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about respecting someone's preferences. The friend clearly expressed his dislike for birthday parties multiple times. The author, however, didn't take that seriously and continued planning. Even though the author had been planning for a while and it's too late to cancel, the main issue is whether they should have respected the friend's stated wishes. \n\nSurprise parties are tricky because they involve doing something without the person's consent. If the person has repeatedly said they hate them, then organizing one without considering their feelings is a problem. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but the friend's autonomy and comfort are more important. It's possible the friend meant it sincerely and the author misinterpreted it as a way to not hurt feelings. However, the friend's recent statement seems to confirm that he really doesn't want a party, and the author is now going against his explicit wishes. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, not listening to the friend's clear statements about disliking parties, especially when the friend is directly involved (hosting the party at his house), shows a lack of respect. The author should have either had an open conversation to clarify or chosen a different way to celebrate without making the friend uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
