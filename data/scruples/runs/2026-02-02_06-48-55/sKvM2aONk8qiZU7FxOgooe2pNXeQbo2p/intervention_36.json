      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted party. The situation is that they planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but when they asked him directly, he said he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend had mentioned before hating parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author went ahead and planned a party despite the friend's previous statements. Even though they asked again and got a clear \"no,\" they still decided to proceed. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential for the friend being upset because it's his own place. \n\nSo, the main issue here is consent. The friend explicitly said he didn't want a party. The author should have respected that. Even if the friend had mentioned hating parties before, the author should have taken those statements seriously. The fact that the friend clarified again when asked directly makes it even more clear. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by ignoring their friend's clear wishes. Planning a surprise party without considering their friend's feelings is inconsiderate. The answer here is probably A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't listen to their friend's preferences, leading to a situation where the friend would be upset. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it's too late to cancel, but that's not an excuse. They should have checked in again or adjusted plans if necessary. The fact that they knew the friend didn't want it and still went through with it shows they didn't respect the friend's wishes. So yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
