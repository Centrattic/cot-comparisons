      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party without considering their friend's feelings.\n\nFirst, the friend explicitly mentioned not wanting a party. The author knew their friend had said that multiple times before. But they thought maybe their friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. However, the friend clarified today that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend has expressed dislike for birthday parties before, the author ignored those clear signals, and now the friend is upset. The author might have thought they were being thoughtful by planning a surprise, but they didn't take into account their friend's clear feelings. Even though the party is already planned and hard to cancel, the main issue is not respecting the friend's wishes. So, the author is likely in the wrong here because they disregarded their friend's preferences despite knowing them. The answer should be A.\n"
