      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The friend didn't want a party and even said he'd be mad if there was one. The author thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment if there was no party. But the friend clearly stated he hates parties, so the author should have taken that into account.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the friend's previous statements about disliking parties. The author mentions that the friend has said he hates birthday parties multiple times. Even if the friend might have been trying to manage expectations, the author should have listened to that preference. The surprise party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential for the friend feeling violated in his own space. \n\nAlso, the author is planning to go ahead with the party despite knowing the friend's feelings. The fact that it's too late to cancel doesn't excuse the decision to proceed without considering the friend's wishes. The author's assumption that the friend was just saying he didn't want a party to avoid disappointment isn't a valid reason to ignore clear statements. \n\nIn social situations, respecting someone's stated preferences is important. Even if the author thought they were acting out of goodwill by planning the party, the friend's autonomy and comfort should take precedence. The surprise aspect adds pressure because the friend can't opt out, which is another layer of being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't listen to the friend's explicit wishes and proceeded with a plan that the friend would find upsetting. That makes the author at fault here.\n"
