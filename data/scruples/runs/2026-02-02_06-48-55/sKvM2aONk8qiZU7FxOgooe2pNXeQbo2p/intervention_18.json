      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party, even though he's mentioned disliking parties before. The author thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment but now realizes it was a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key points: The party is at the friend's house, and the friend is upset. The author didn't listen to their friend's clear statement. Even though the friend had mentioned hating parties before, the author ignored that and kept planning. Surprises can be tricky, especially when someone has repeatedly expressed their dislike for them. The friend now says they would be mad if there was a party, so the author's actions are directly causing distress. \n\nThe main issue here is respecting boundaries. Even if the friend had previously mentioned not wanting parties, the author should have taken those statements seriously. The fact that the friend confirmed their dislike again today adds weight to their request. The author's reasoning was that maybe the friend didn't want to disappoint others, but that's an assumption. It's not the friend's responsibility to clarify their feelings if they've already communicated them clearly. \n\nAlso, the party being at the friend's house makes it more intrusive. The author is using the friend's space to host a party that the friend didn't want, which can be stressful for the host. The friend might feel trapped in their own home during the event. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's too late to cancel, but that's more about their own inconvenience rather than the friend's feelings. The friend's well-being should be prioritized over the effort put into planning. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author didn't consider the friend's clear wishes and proceeded regardless. That shows a lack of respect for the friend's autonomy and preferences. Even if the intention was to celebrate, the method was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for not heeding their friend's explicit request and for causing them distress. The correct answer would be A.\n"
