      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, who explicitly said they don't like parties. The friend mentioned they would be mad if there was a party, and the party is at his house. The author had been planning it for a long time and now can't cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend has expressed multiple times that he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But the friend clarified today that if there's a party, he'll be angry. The party is at his house, so the author is going ahead regardless.\n\nSurprise parties can be a hit or miss. Even if the author thought they were doing something nice, they didn't check in with the friend properly. The friend's clear statement should have been a red flag. The author might have ignored the friend's preferences, assuming they were just being humble. But the friend made it clear he didn't want any party. The author's actions could lead to the friend being upset, which is not ideal. The fact that the party is at the friend's house makes it even more intrusive because the friend's home is being taken over for an event he doesn't want. The author might be in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's direct wishes, even if they had good intentions. Planning it for a long time doesn't excuse not respecting the friend's feelings now. So, the answer is A.\n"
