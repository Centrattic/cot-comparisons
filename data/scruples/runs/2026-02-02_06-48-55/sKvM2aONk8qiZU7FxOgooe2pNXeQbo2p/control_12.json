      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend doesn't want.\n\nFirst, the friend clearly expressed before that he hates birthday parties. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but now the friend is explicitly telling them they're glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at the friend's house, which complicates things because it's their space. The author has been planning for a long time and can't cancel now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author ignore clear indications from the friend? The friend said multiple times they hate parties, and now he's specifically saying he'd be mad. Even if the author thought the friend was just being humble before, the latest conversation makes it clear. Planning a party in this situation seems to go against the friend's wishes. Also, holding it at the friend's house means the friend has to deal with it in their own space, which could be really uncomfortable. The author's justification is that they thought the friend was lying to avoid disappointment, but the friend's recent statement contradicts that. The author is proceeding despite this, which might be inconsiderate. So, yes, the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't listen to the friend's clear preferences and are causing distress.\n"
