      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend, but the friend didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend had mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now the party is planned, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author had previously known the friend didn't like parties but thought he was just saying it to not be disappointed. The party is at his house, so the friend would be upset being there. The author is now considering if they're in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend's feelings are clear now\u2014directly stating he's glad there's no party and would be angry if there was one. The author might have ignored clear signs. Even though the friend had mentioned disliking parties before, the author might have misinterpreted past statements. But now the friend has explicitly said he doesn't want a party, so the author's decision to go ahead despite that seems like they're not respecting the friend's current wishes. \n\nThe key here is whether the author should have listened to the friend's direct statement. Even if the author thought the friend was joking or trying to avoid disappointment before, the friend now made it clear. Ignoring that could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem because the friend would be forced to be there. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they ignored the friend's explicit wishes. Even if they had good intentions, not respecting someone's current feelings about their own birthday is a mistake. The author should have canceled the party when the friend made it clear.\n"
