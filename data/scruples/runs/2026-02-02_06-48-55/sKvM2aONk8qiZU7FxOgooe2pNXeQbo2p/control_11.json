      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday. The friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so the friend would be especially upset. The author knew the friend had said he hates parties before but thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and going ahead with the party.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend explicitly stated his dislike for parties, the author ignored those statements, and the party is at his house. The author is now concerned about causing upset. The question is whether this is an instance of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole).\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's wishes, especially a close friend, is important. Even if the author thought the friend might be lying about wanting a party to be polite, the friend was very clear in his most recent message. The fact that the friend is upset enough to express that he would be \"mad af\" if there was a party suggests that the author overrode his friend's clear boundaries. \n\nEven if the party is already planned and hard to cancel, the author should have respected the friend's expressed wishes. Surprise parties can be nice, but when the person explicitly says they don't want one, it's a violation of their autonomy. The best friend's house is also a private space, and hosting a party there without the host's consent is a big deal. \n\nSo, the author didn't listen to their friend's clear communication, leading to the friend's distress. Even if the intention was good, the action disregards the friend's preferences and personal space. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
