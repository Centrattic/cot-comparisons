      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend even though the friend said they wouldn't want it. The friend has previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the person assumed the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset, and the party is at his house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the friend made it clear he doesn't like parties, the person ignored that, and the party is at his home. The friend is now angry. Even though they planned it for a long time, it's too late to cancel. \n\nI think the person is in the wrong because they didn't listen to their friend's preferences. The friend had explicitly stated his dislike for parties before, and even though the person thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, they should have respected the expressed feelings. Using the house for the party without the owner's consent adds to the problem. The surprise might have been a good intention, but the friend's wishes were clear. So the answer is A.\n"
