      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend when the friend clearly didn't want one. The friend had mentioned before not liking parties, but the author assumed the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset because the party is at his house and he's mad.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the friend had expressed disliking birthday parties multiple times. The author didn't take those statements seriously, thinking maybe the friend was just trying to avoid being disappointed if there wasn't a party. But the friend actually meant he didn't want a party at all. The author went ahead with planning a party despite knowing the friend's preferences, even though it's too late to cancel now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author should have respected the friend's known wishes. Since the friend had clearly stated before that he hates parties, even if the author misinterpreted the reason, the author still went against the friend's expressed preferences. Even if the author thought the friend was just being modest or trying to avoid disappointment, the friend's actual feelings were clear. Throwing the party regardless of the friend's stated dislike shows a failure to listen and respect the friend's wishes, which is the crux of the issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's explicit preferences and proceeded with a plan that the friend specifically did not want.\n"
