      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The key points here are the friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties and now explicitly saying he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The writer planned the party despite these clear indications.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned multiple times before that he hates birthday parties. Even if the writer thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, those are strong signals. Then, when the writer asked directly what the friend was doing for his birthday, the friend clearly stated he's glad there's no party and would be angry if there was one. That's pretty explicit. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend's discomfort is compounded by the location. \n\nThe writer knew about the friend's dislike but still went ahead with the party. Even though they might have thought the friend was just being humble or didn't want to seem ungrateful, the friend's recent direct statement should have been a clear sign. The fact that it's too late to cancel is a practical issue but doesn't absolve the writer of responsibility. \n\nConsidering the friend's feelings and respecting their wishes is important in a friendship. The writer's actions, while well-intentioned, disregarded the friend's expressed preferences, leading to potential hurt and anger. So, the writer is in the wrong here because they didn't listen to a clear and direct refusal from their friend.\n"
