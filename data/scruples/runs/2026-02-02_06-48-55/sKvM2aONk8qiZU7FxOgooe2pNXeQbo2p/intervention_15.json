      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The key points here are the friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties and the current situation where the friend explicitly says he doesn't want a party. The author planned it for a long time and now it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's past expressions. The author mentions that the friend has said he hates birthday parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. That's a common misunderstanding\u2014thinking someone is being modest or wants to avoid hurt feelings. However, the friend clearly stated this time that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. Even though the party is at his house, the author proceeded anyway.\n\nThe main issue here is respecting the friend's wishes. If someone explicitly states they don't want a party, especially after previous indications, it's reasonable to expect that honoring their wishes is important. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but the friend's explicit refusal should take precedence. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the potential for the friend feeling disrespected or betrayed because it's his space.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the author's actions. They wanted to make the friend happy, but misinterpreted the friend's past comments. However, the final statement from the friend was clear, so not listening to that shows a lack of attention to his current wishes. The argument could be made that the author was trying to be thoughtful, but the outcome is that they ignored the friend's explicit request, which is a mistake.\n\nIn terms of social norms, surprising someone with something they've repeatedly said they don't want, especially when it's personal and at their home, is generally seen as inconsiderate. The author might have overestimated their knowledge of the friend's preferences and underestimated the friend's feelings on the matter. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's clear current wishes despite the planning involved.\n"
