      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw a surprise party without considering their friend's wishes is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one, but the author didn't listen because they thought the friend was just trying not to be disappointed. Now they're planning to go ahead with the party despite knowing the friend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's clear communication. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The author should have taken that seriously. Even if the friend had a history of saying they don't want a party, the author should have respected that. The key point is that the friend directly stated they didn't want it, so the author's decision to proceed despite that is problematic.\n\nNext, the author mentions it's too late to cancel. But that's not a valid excuse. If the friend is clearly against it, the author should have tried to cancel or at least check if the friend's stance had changed. The fact that they didn't listen and are now going through with it shows a lack of respect for the friend's preferences.\n\nAlso, the surprise party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential for making the friend uncomfortable or angry. The author prioritized their own plans over the friend's feelings, which is a red flag. True friendship involves respecting each other's boundaries, even if it's something you wanted to do for the other person.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author thought they were doing something nice, but in this case, the friend's clear communication should have taken precedence. The author's assumption that the friend was just trying not to be disappointed is a misinterpretation of the friend's actual feelings. So the author didn't take the necessary steps to confirm if the friend's feelings had changed, leading to a breach of trust.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they ignored their friend's expressed wishes and proceeded with the party regardless, which could harm their friendship.\n"
