      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about throwing a surprise party for a best friend's birthday. The friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party, and the author is planning to go through with it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's previous statements. If he said multiple times that he hates birthday parties, that's a clear signal. The author might have dismissed those comments, thinking the friend was just being modest or didn't mean it. But if the friend actually meant it, then the author didn't take his preferences seriously. That's a problem because respecting someone's wishes is important, especially in a close friendship.\n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's discomfort. If the friend is forced to host a party he doesn't want, he might feel even more upset. The author also mentions that it's too late to cancel, but that doesn't mean they should go through with it. Maybe there's a compromise, like changing the party to a private event or doing something else instead. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have good intentions, thinking they're doing something nice for their friend. But intentions don't matter if the action causes harm. The key here is whether the author listened to their friend's expressed preferences. Since they didn't take the friend's feelings into account and are proceeding despite knowing the friend's dislike for such events, it's more likely the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they ignored their friend's clear preferences and are proceeding without considering his feelings, which is disrespectful.\n"
