      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend when the friend didn't want it. The key points here are that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there wasn't one. The author planned the party for a long time and now it's too late to cancel. The friend is upset and doesn't want a party at his own house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was negligent in not taking the friend's previous statements seriously. The friend clearly expressed dislike for parties multiple times, but the author dismissed those as hypothetical. Surprise parties can be tricky because they're supposed to be a surprise, but in this case, the friend's preferences were known. The author should have double-checked or at least been more cautious, especially since the friend has a history of disliking such events. \n\nEven if the author had good intentions, the execution might have been flawed. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the conflict because the host is now being forced into a situation he didn't want. The author's assumption that the friend might have been lying about not wanting a party could be seen as not respecting his friend's true feelings. \n\nSo, the main issue is respecting the friend's wishes versus the author's intention to do something nice. The author might have overstepped by not considering that the friend's past statements were genuine. Even if the party is already planned, the damage is done, and the author's actions disregarded the friend's expressed preferences. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
