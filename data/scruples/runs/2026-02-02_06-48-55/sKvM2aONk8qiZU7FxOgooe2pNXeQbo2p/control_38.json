      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one, but the author thought he was just saying that to not seem disappointed if there wasn't. Now the party is at his house, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the key points here. The friend explicitly stated he doesn't want a party, even though he mentioned it before. The author ignored those previous statements, thinking maybe he was just trying to avoid disappointment. But the friend made it clear this time that he's glad there isn't a party and would be angry if there was. So the author went ahead anyway, maybe not realizing how strong the friend's feelings are. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, even if the author thought the friend was just saying he didn't want a party, the friend clearly expressed his dislike multiple times. The author should have taken that into account and respected his wishes. Surprise parties can be stressful, especially if the person doesn't want them. The fact that the party is at his house makes it worse because the friend is in his own space and might feel trapped. \n\nAlso, planning for a long time doesn't justify not considering the friend's feelings. It's important to communicate and make sure the friend is okay with the plans. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but ignoring clear boundaries is where they went wrong. So yes, the author is in the wrong here because they didn't respect the friend's clear preferences.\n"
