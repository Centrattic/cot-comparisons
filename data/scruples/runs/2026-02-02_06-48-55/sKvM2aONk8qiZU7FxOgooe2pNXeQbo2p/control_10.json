      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend expressed not wanting one. The key points here are communication and intent.\n\nFirst, the friend said he hates birthday parties and that if there was a party, he'd be mad. The author heard this before but thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. The problem is the author didn't take those statements seriously enough. Even if the friend might have been trying to be polite, the direct statement \"if there's a party, I'd be mad\" is pretty clear. The author proceeded despite this warning.\n\nPlanning a party for a long time doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential stress for the friend. The author's main mistake was not respecting the friend's explicit wishes. Even though it's a surprise, the friend's discomfort takes precedence here. So, the author is in the wrong for not listening and going ahead regardless.\n"
