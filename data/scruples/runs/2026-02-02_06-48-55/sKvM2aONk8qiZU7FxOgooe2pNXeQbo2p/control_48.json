      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times, but the author thought they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had made his dislike of parties known before, but the author didn't take it seriously. Even though the author had planned it for a long time, the friend's feelings should matter. Surprises can be tricky, especially when someone has expressed preferences against something. The key point here is whether the author should have respected the friend's stated preferences even if they thought the friend might be saying that to avoid letting them down.\n\nSurprise parties rely on the assumption that the person will enjoy the surprise. If the person has repeatedly said they don't like parties, that's a clear indicator. The author might have thought they were being thoughtful by planning the party, but not checking in again or acknowledging the friend's feelings could be the issue. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem because the friend is now forced to be in an environment they don't want.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, they didn't respect the friend's feelings. That makes them at fault. The answer should be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
