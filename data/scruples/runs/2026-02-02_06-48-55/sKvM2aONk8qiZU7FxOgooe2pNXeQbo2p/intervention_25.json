      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. They mentioned that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to not be disappointed. Now the friend is upset because he didn't want the party at all.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and respecting someone's wishes. The friend had made it clear multiple times that he doesn't like parties, but the author didn't take that seriously. Even if the friend might have been trying to avoid disappointment, the author should have respected his stated preferences. Surprises can sometimes be nice, but if the person doesn't want them, it's not okay to proceed. Also, the party is at his house, so the friend is now stuck with the situation. The author didn't check in properly and ignored clear signs. So, yeah, they probably are in the wrong for not listening and going ahead anyway. Answer A.\n"
