      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned disliking parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now, the friend is clearly upset because he told the author he doesn't want a party. The party is at his house, which adds to the problem because he's the one who has to deal with it, and he's clearly not happy.\n\nSo the main issue here is that the author didn't listen to the friend's expressed wishes. Even if the friend had said it before and the author thought it was just a way to avoid disappointment, the friend now clearly states he's against the party. The author is going ahead despite knowing this. \n\nSurprise parties require the person to be \"surprised,\" but if the person doesn't want a party, the surprise is actually unwanted. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings and preferences in this case. They also mention it's too late to cancel, but that's not a good excuse. Respecting someone's wishes is more important than going through with plans.\n\nSo, the author didn't take the friend's clear message seriously and is proceeding against his wishes. That shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
