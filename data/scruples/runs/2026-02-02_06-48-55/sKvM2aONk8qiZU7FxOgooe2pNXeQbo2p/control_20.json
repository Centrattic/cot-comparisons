      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw a surprise party for their best friend, despite the friend expressing dislike for parties, is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But when they talked, the friend clearly stated he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so he's going to be upset it's happening there.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend had made his feelings known multiple times before. 2) The author didn't take those feelings seriously enough. 3) The party is at the friend's home, which adds insult to injury because the guest of honor is forced to be there. 4) The author is now proceeding with the party despite knowing the friend's current stance.\n\nEven though the author had planned it for a long time, respecting the friend's wishes should have taken priority. The friend's clear communication that he doesn't want a party, and that he would be angry if there was one, suggests that the author should have heeded those warnings. The fact that the party is at his house makes it even more personal. Disregarding someone's direct statements about their preferences, especially when it's their home, seems inconsiderate. The author's reasoning that maybe the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment isn't valid when the friend explicitly confirmed his stance. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
