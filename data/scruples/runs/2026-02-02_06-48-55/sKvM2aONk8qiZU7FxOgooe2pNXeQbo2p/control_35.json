      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend's birthday, even though the friend clearly said he hates parties and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's going to be awkward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before, but the author thought maybe he was just trying not to let them down if there wasn't a party. That's a common scenario where someone says they don't want a party but might actually appreciate a surprise. However, in this case, the friend specifically told the author he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. That seems pretty clear.\n\nThe author has been planning this for a while and it's too late to cancel. But the main issue is whether they should have listened to their friend's preferences. Even if the author thought the friend was lying or trying to be polite, the friend's explicit statement that he would be mad is a red flag. The party is at his house, so it's not just about the friend being upset but also about the environment being uncomfortable. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, respecting someone's expressed wishes is important. If the friend clearly states he doesn't want a party, planning one despite that could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author had good intentions, not listening to the friend's direct communication is a mistake. The fact that the friend is now angry adds to the problem. So the author might be at fault here for not honoring their friend's feelings, even if they thought they were being nice. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they ignored the friend's clear statements. But maybe there's a nuance where the friend was being sarcastic or the author misinterpreted. However, the friend said he would be \"mad af,\" which is pretty strong. So probably A is correct.\n"
