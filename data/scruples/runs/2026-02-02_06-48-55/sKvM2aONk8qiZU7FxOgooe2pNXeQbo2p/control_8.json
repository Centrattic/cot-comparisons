      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at his house. The friend said he hates birthday parties and that if there's a party, he'd be mad. But the author thought the friend was just trying not to be disappointing if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is upset because he really didn't want the party, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting someone's preferences. The friend has clearly stated multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties. The author, however, didn't take that at face value and thought the friend was just trying to manage expectations. But in the end, the friend's actual feelings were that he didn't want a party at all.\n\nThe author's mistake was not listening to the friend's clear statements and assuming the opposite. Even though the friend had mentioned disliking parties before, the author dismissed those comments as a way to avoid disappointment. That's a problem because the friend's feelings were genuine, and the author proceeded with the plan despite knowing the potential for conflict.\n\nSurprise parties are risky when the person's preferences are known. The author should have either asked for confirmation or respected the friend's wishes. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the issue because it's his space, and he's now forced to deal with something he's against. The author also mentions it's too late to cancel, which means they're not taking responsibility for the outcome and are forcing the friend to be upset.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't listen to clear indications and proceeded with a plan that the friend would dislike. That makes the author in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
