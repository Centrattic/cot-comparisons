      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned the surprise party is in the wrong. The situation is that the best friend didn't want a party, but the planner went ahead anyway despite previous warnings.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The planner thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now, when the party is planned and the friend is clearly upset, the planner is wondering if they made a mistake.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the planner ignore clear signals from the friend? Even if the friend might have meant it differently before, the planner should have taken those statements seriously. Planning a party without confirming the friend's current feelings could be seen as not respecting their wishes. The friend is now angry because the party is at his house, which adds to the problem. The planner also acknowledges it's too late to cancel, but that doesn't change the fact that they went against the friend's expressed preferences.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the planner didn't listen to the friend's repeated dislikes. Even if there was a misunderstanding before, the friend's recent statement was explicit. The planner should have prioritized the friend's feelings over their own plans. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
