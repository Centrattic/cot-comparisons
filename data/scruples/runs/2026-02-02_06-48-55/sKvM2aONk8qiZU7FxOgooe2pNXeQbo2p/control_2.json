      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend didn't want a party and expressed that clearly, but the host thought they were just saying that to not be disappointed. Now, the party is at the friend's house, and the friend is upset. So, the main points here are about not listening to the friend's wishes, despite previous statements about disliking parties.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The host acknowledged that but thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. But the friend actually meant it and now is upset. So the host didn't take the friend's feelings into account, even though there were clear signs (previous statements) about not wanting a party.\n\nThe host started planning the party without confirming the friend's current feelings. Even though they asked, the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. That's pretty clear. The host is now refusing to cancel because it's too late, but the friend is going to be at his own house, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the host didn't respect the friend's boundaries and wishes. Even if they thought the friend was just saying it before, the friend made it clear this time. The host's actions caused the friend distress. Therefore, the host is in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party against the friend's explicit wishes. The answer should be A.\n"
