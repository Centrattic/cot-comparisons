      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author's best friend hates birthday parties but the author ignored that and went ahead with planning a party at the friend's house.\n\nFirst, the friend clearly expressed not wanting a party multiple times before. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but now the friend is explicitly mad. The party is at his house, so the friend has no choice but to be there if it happens. The author is planning it for a long time and thinks it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nKey points: The author ignored the friend's previous statements about disliking parties. Even after the friend directly said he would be mad if there was a party, the author still proceeded. The party is at the friend's home, which adds to the friend's distress. The author's reasoning was that the friend might have been trying to avoid disappointment, but that's not a valid excuse for ignoring clear preferences.\n\nEthically, respecting someone's wishes is important. The author should have listened to the friend's repeated dislikes and not forced a party he didn't want. The fact that the author went ahead despite knowing the friend's current feelings shows a lack of consideration. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
