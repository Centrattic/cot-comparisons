      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned a surprise party for their best friend is in the wrong. The friend didn't want a party and explicitly said so, but the planner didn't listen and proceeded anyway.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties. The planner might have dismissed those comments as the friend just being humble or not wanting to disappoint. However, when directly asked, the friend clearly stated he would be mad if there was a party. The planner still went ahead, even though it's too late to cancel now.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend communicated his dislike, the planner ignored that communication, and now the party is happening at the friend's house. The planner might have thought they were doing something nice, but ignoring the friend's explicit wishes is a problem here. Planning a surprise party without the person's consent, especially when they've already stated their preferences, can be considered inconsiderate. The planner should have respected the friend's wishes instead of assuming they were just being modest. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
