      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who planned the surprise party is in the wrong. The situation is that the person threw a party for their best friend, but the friend didn't want it and now is upset. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the planner thought they were just saying that to avoid disappointment.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the friend had a history of disliking parties, but the planner didn't take that into account. Even though the planning was done and it's too late to cancel, the friend is clearly upset now. The planner didn't check in properly and assumed the friend might have changed their mind or was just being modest. \n\nBut the friend was explicit in their current feelings when they said they were glad there wasn't a party and would be mad if there was. The planner should have respected that. Even if the friend had said it before, the latest conversation shows their current stance. The planner might have overruled the friend's explicit wishes, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the planner didn't listen to the friend's clear statement in their conversation. Even if the friend had previous comments that were ambiguous, the latest input was clear. The planner's assumption that the friend was lying or trying to avoid disappointment wasn't valid here. The friendship is important, and respecting the friend's current preferences should take priority. Therefore, the planner is in the wrong for not heeding the friend's direct message. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
