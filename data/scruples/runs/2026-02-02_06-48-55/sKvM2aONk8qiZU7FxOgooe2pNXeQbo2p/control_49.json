      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they threw a surprise birthday party for their best friend at his house, but now the friend is upset because he hates parties and said he would be mad if there was one. The writer planned it for a long time and feels it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before, but the writer thought the friend was just trying not to let the writer down. Now the friend is angry because the party is at his own house. The writer is wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party anyway.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the writer should have known not to plan a party despite the friend's previous statements. The friend clearly expressed his dislike for parties, even if he said he wouldn't be disappointed. The writer might have been trying to do something nice, but they ignored clear red flags. \n\nThe AITA subreddit usually looks at intentions and whether the person acted with malice or was negligent. The writer had the best intentions but didn't heed the friend's repeated preferences. Even if they thought they were doing something good, not considering the friend's clear aversion to parties could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's distress. The writer might not have realized that the party being at his house would make it worse. But since the friend explicitly stated he would be mad if there was a party, the writer should have respected that. \n\nEven though it's a surprise and the writer has planned it for a long time, the fact remains that they disregarded the friend's known preferences. This could be seen as a lack of communication and not taking the friend's feelings seriously. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
