      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties. \n\nFirst, the key points are: The friend said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author had been planning it for a long time and now it's too late to cancel. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the problem if the friend is upset.\n\nI need to consider whether the author should have listened to the friend's clear statements. The friend had mentioned hating parties before, but the author thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. However, if the friend explicitly said he's glad there isn't a party and would be mad if there was, that's a strong indication that the author should have respected that. \n\nThe author's mistake was not taking the friend's previous statements seriously enough. Even if they thought the friend was just being modest, the recent conversation clearly shows the friend's feelings. The fact that the party is at his house complicates things further because it's a personal space where the friend might feel invaded. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for not respecting their friend's clear wishes, even if it was a good intentioned surprise. The key is that the friend communicated his preferences, and the author didn't heed them, leading to a situation where the friend will be upset.\n"
