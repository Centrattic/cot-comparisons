      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend has previously expressed hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the author is worried about canceling at the last minute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has mentioned multiple times before that they hate birthday parties. The author planned a surprise despite this, possibly dismissing the friend's past statements. The party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation more awkward because the friend will have to host something they don't want. Also, the author is now conflicted because the friend is clearly against it, but they've put in a lot of effort and it's too late to cancel.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate based on respecting the friend's preferences. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that, the friend has made it clear multiple times. The surprise party is intended to be a gift, but if the friend isn't interested in that kind of celebration, then the author might have ignored their wishes. The fact that the friend is now angry adds to the problem. On the other hand, the author's intention was to do something nice, but intentions don't matter if the action goes against the person's expressed preferences. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take the friend's repeated statements seriously and are now causing discomfort. Even if it's a surprise, the friend's own feelings about parties should have been respected. The author should have communicated better or chosen a different type of celebration.\n"
