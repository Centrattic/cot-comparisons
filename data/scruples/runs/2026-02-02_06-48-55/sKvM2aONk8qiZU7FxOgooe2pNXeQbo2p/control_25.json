      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who organized a surprise party for their best friend is in the wrong. The friend had previously said they hate birthday parties, but the planner thought maybe they were just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now, the friend is upset and doesn't want the party, but it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had clearly expressed dislike for parties multiple times. The planner ignored those statements, thinking the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend is now angry because the planner didn't listen. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the planner should have taken the friend's previous statements seriously. If someone repeatedly says they don't like parties, even if they later act like they don't mind, the planner might be at fault for not respecting that. However, the planner might have thought they were doing something nice, thinking the friend would be happy. \n\nBut the friend is now upset, which means the planner didn't consider their feelings properly. Even if the friend was trying to avoid disappointment, the planner should have respected their stated preferences. Planning a surprise party when the person doesn't want it can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they had said so before. \n\nThe fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the problem because it's intrusive. The planner might have overstepped by not asking directly or checking in more thoroughly. So, the answer leans towards the planner being in the wrong because they ignored the friend's clear preferences despite being close enough to be best friends. That's a breach of trust and respect.\n"
