      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend's birthday, but the friend didn't want a party. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the person thought maybe he was just saying that to not be disappointed. Now the friend is upset because the party is at his house.\n\nHmm. So the user is asking if they did the wrong thing by not listening to the friend's previous statements. The key points here are that the friend clearly expressed his dislike for parties multiple times, but the user didn't take that seriously enough, thinking maybe he was just trying to avoid disappointment. The user went ahead and planned the party anyway, and now it's too late to cancel. The friend is really mad because it's at his house.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. Well, the friend explicitly stated he didn't want a party, even if it was just to avoid being disappointed. The user should have respected that. Even if the friend had said he might be disappointed if there was no party, the user should have asked for clarification. But since the friend had said he hates parties, it's a red flag. The user assumed the friend was just saying that, but that's not a valid excuse. The user's actions led to the friend being upset, especially since it's at his house. The user is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's clear preferences. So the answer should be A.\n"
