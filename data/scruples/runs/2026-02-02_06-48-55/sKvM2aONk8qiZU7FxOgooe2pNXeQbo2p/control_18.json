      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, despite the friend having expressed dislike for birthday parties before. The key points here are that the friend clearly stated he didn't want a party, even though the person had been planning it for a while.\n\nFirst, the friend mentioned several times that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. However, in their recent talk, the friend explicitly said he would be glad if there was no party and would be very mad if there was one. The party is at his house, which adds to the problem because the friend would be forced to deal with it.\n\nThe author knew about the friend's preferences but chose to ignore them, possibly because they were already planning and didn't want to cancel. The issue here is about respecting someone's wishes. Even if the author intended to make the friend happy, ignoring clear statements about not wanting a party seems like a breach of trust and respect. The fact that the party is at the friend's house makes it worse because the friend can't just leave the situation, which could cause more distress. So, the author probably did act inconsiderately by not listening to the friend's explicit wishes. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
