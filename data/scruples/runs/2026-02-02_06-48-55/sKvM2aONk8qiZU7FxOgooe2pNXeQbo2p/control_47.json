      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author had been planning it for a while and now it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend explicitly told the author he didn't want a party and would be angry. The author had previously thought the friend was just being humble or didn't want to disappoint. But now, with direct communication, the author still decided to go ahead. \n\nSurprise parties usually require the person not knowing, but since the party is at the friend's house and he's aware, it's a planned surprise. However, the friend made it clear he's against it. The author ignored this and proceeded. \n\nIn terms of friendship, respecting someone's wishes is important. Even if it's a well-intentioned gesture, not respecting a direct request can be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have thought they were being thoughtful, but the friend clearly stated his preferences. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded their friend's explicit wishes, even though they had been planning it. The harm caused by making the friend upset would outweigh the effort put into planning.\n"
