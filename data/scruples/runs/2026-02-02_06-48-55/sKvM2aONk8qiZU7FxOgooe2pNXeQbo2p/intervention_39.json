      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned a surprise birthday party without considering the friend's preferences is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times, but the planner thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's expressed wishes. If he explicitly said he hates parties, even if the planner thought he was just being modest, the planner should have listened. The key here is whether the planner considered the friend's feelings or not. The planner might have thought they were doing something nice, but if the friend clearly didn't want it, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation worse because it's his space. The friend might feel forced to host even though he doesn't want to. The planner might have overstepped by not checking in properly, even if they thought they were being considerate. \n\nEven though the planner has been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel, that doesn't excuse the initial oversight. The main issue is the lack of communication. Instead of assuming, the planner should have confirmed the friend's actual wishes, especially since the friend has mentioned his dislike before. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's expressed preferences despite multiple clear indications. The intention was good, but the action was misguided due to not heeding the friend's feelings.\n"
