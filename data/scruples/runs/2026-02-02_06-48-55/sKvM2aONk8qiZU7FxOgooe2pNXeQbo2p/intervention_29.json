      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend, but the friend didn't want it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend said he hates birthday parties and was glad there wasn't one. But the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're going ahead with the party despite the friend's clear statements.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. Well, the friend had expressed dislike for parties multiple times before, and the author knew about this. Even though the author thought the friend was just saying that to not be disappointed, the friend actually made it clear he'd be mad if there was a party. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend explicitly stated he didn't want a party, the author decided to go ahead anyway, and they're too late to cancel. So even if the author thought they were being considerate, they ignored the friend's explicit wishes. That seems like a mistake. The author should have respected the friend's preference, even if they thought the friend was just being humble. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
