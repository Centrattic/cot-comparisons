      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party at the friend's house. The friend didn't want a party but the author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is clearly upset, hates parties, and the author is going ahead with it despite the friend's explicit statement. The user thinks the author is wrong (AITA yes) but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author should have listened to the friend's previous statements. The friend mentioned multiple times they hate birthday parties, but the author assumed they were just saying that. That's a key point. If someone repeatedly states a preference, even if you think they might not mean it, you should probably respect that. The author's assumption that the friend would be okay with a party despite prior statements shows a lack of attention to the friend's expressed wishes.\n\nThen, there's the fact that the party is at the friend's house. That adds another layer of stress because the friend is forced to be in their own home during a party they don't want. It's not just about the party itself but also about the friend's comfort and autonomy in their space. The author might not realize that insisting on a party under these circumstances is disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is continuing with the party despite knowing the friend's current feelings makes it worse. Even if it's too late to cancel, the author is choosing to proceed, which could be seen as prioritizing their own plans over the friend's well-being. That's a sign of not considering the friend's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author had good intentions, thinking they were doing something nice for a friend. But intentions don't matter if the action disregards someone's clear preferences. The friend's feelings here take precedence over the author's efforts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't listen to the friend's repeated expressions of dislike for parties and ignored their latest explicit statement. The consequence is making the friend uncomfortable in their own home. That seems to be a breach of trust and respect. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
