      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and doesn't want a party, especially since it's at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author planned a surprise party without the friend's knowledge. The friend had expressed dislike for birthday parties before, but the author dismissed those statements, thinking the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment if there was no party. The friend now is clearly upset, and the party is too late to cancel.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should have listened to the friend's previous statements. Even if the friend said he hates parties, the author might have thought he was being generous. However, the friend explicitly said he would be mad if there was a party. The author's actions led to the friend's anger, which is a direct consequence. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a decision based on their own interpretation of the friend's statements. The friend's clear and recent statement indicates that the author should have respected that. Even if the author had good intentions, not considering the friend's explicit wishes shows a lack of respect for his preferences. \n\nSurprise parties are supposed to be a nice gesture, but they can backfire if the person doesn't want them. The author's main mistake was not verifying the friend's current feelings, especially after the friend had a history of expressing dislike for such events. Planning something so late that it's impossible to cancel now adds to the problem because the author is forcing the friend to deal with a party he didn't want, especially at his own home.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's clear and repeated preferences, leading to a situation where the friend is upset and the author is causing unnecessary distress. The fact that it's at the friend's house makes it even more problematic because it's invading the friend's space against his will. Therefore, the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
