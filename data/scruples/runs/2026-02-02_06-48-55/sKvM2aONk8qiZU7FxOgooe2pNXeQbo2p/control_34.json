      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties. The writer didn't take that seriously, thinking maybe he just didn't want to disappoint if there was no party. Now the friend is upset and the party is at his house, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's clear past statements about disliking parties, the writer's decision to proceed despite those warnings, and the fact that the party is at the friend's home. \n\nThe writer might argue that they wanted to make the friend's birthday special, but the friend's feelings are valid. Ignoring someone's expressed preferences, especially a close friend, could be seen as inconsiderate. The writer didn't check in properly and now is causing the friend stress. \n\nEven though the party is already planned and hard to cancel, the main issue is not listening to the friend's feelings. The writer should have respected the friend's wishes instead of assuming they were just being humble or wanted to avoid disappointment. \n\nSo, yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering their friend's clear preferences and pushing forward with the party.\n"
