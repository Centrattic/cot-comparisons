I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is getting married, gave their sister a plus one before she had a boyfriend. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talkative, and seems to mooch off her. The author decided to rescind the plus one and found a cousin to take that spot instead. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about whether the author has the right to exclude the sister's boyfriend. Weddings are personal events, and the author wants it to be intimate with close friends and family. But the sister feels the boyfriend should be there since they've only been dating six months. \n\nI need to consider etiquette and family dynamics. Usually, wedding guests are the couple's choice. If the author is paying for the wedding, they might have control over the guest list. However, the sister is a family member, so there's a personal relationship aspect. The sister might feel that the boyfriend is important to her, even if the family doesn't like him.\n\nThe author might argue that they want a comfortable environment and don't want someone who's disruptive. On the other hand, excluding a partner could be hurtful. The sister's threat to not attend is a strong reaction, but maybe she feels her partner's presence is important.\n\nI should also think about whether the author acted inconsiderately. They gave the sister a plus one before, but now rescind it. Even though they found a replacement, it's last minute, which might add stress. The sister's boyfriend being a negative influence is a point, but six months is a short time. Maybe the family's dislike is based on first impressions, and they might not fully know the boyfriend.\n\nAnother angle: is the author overstepping by excluding a family member's partner? Or is it their right to control the guest list? If the wedding is the author's event, they might have the right, but it could damage family relationships. The sister might feel disrespected, which could lead to a bigger rift.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing the author's desire for a good event and the sister's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if they prioritize their own event, but they need to consider the family relationship. However, the sister's threat to skip the wedding is a consequence the author should weigh. The answer is tricky, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to handle it carefully.\n"
