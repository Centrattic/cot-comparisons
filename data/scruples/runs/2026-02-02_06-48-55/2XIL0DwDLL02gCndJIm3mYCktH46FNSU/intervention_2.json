I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a 27-year-old man who's getting married and has decided to rescind his sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The original plus one was given when her ex was still around, so that's understandable. Now, the new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author doesn't want him there because they want an intimate wedding with close friends and family. They managed to get a cousin as a replacement to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not come.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants everyone at the wedding to be people he actually likes, especially since it's a small event. The sister, on the other hand, feels like she should be allowed to bring her partner. The key points here are about boundaries, family dynamics, and the right to make decisions about one's own wedding.\n\nWeddings are personal, and the couple usually sets the guest list. However, family relationships can get complicated. The author is prioritizing his comfort and the vibe of the event. The sister might feel that the relationship being 6 months is significant, but the author's dislike for the boyfriend is based on personal interactions. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if he's cutting off the sister over a partner she's with, but it's also about their own event.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to exclude someone based on personal dislike? How important is it to maintain family relationships versus personal preferences? The sister is threatening not to come, which could have long-term consequences. The author might be in the right if he's standing by his decision for his own event, but it's a delicate balance. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family expectations. But generally, the person whose wedding it is might have more say in the guest list. However, excluding a family member's partner could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the author did offer a replacement, which shows they tried to mitigate the financial issue. The sister's threat might be an overreaction. Still, the author is making a choice that affects a family member. It's a tough call. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because it's their event, but some might argue that family should come first. However, the sister's reaction is extreme, which might indicate that the author is justified. So maybe answer B.\n"
