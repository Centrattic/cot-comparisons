I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding. The sister's new boyfriend is disliked by the family for various reasons: unemployed, mooching, and talkative.\n\nFirst, the author gave the sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now the new guy is causing issues. The author wants to exclude him to maintain an intimate setting. They managed to get a cousin as a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening not to come if he isn't included, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nThe key points here are the author's rationale for the decision. They want the wedding to be close-knit and everyone there should be someone they enjoy. The sister is upset because she wants to bring her partner. But the author is prioritizing their own comfort and the event's dynamics. \n\nWeddings are personal events, and the hosts usually have the say in guest lists. The sister's reaction seems extreme, especially since the couple has only been dating six months. It's not unreasonable for the author to adjust the guest list to avoid family tension. However, cutting off a plus one last minute could be seen as harsh, even if there's a replacement. The sister's threat to miss the wedding complicates things, but the author's reasons are about their own event's atmosphere. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a call for their own event. The sister's reaction is more about her feelings, but the author has the right to set boundaries for their wedding. Answer B.\n"
