I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding. The situation is that the sister's new boyfriend is unpopular with the author's family, and they decided to exclude him, which led to the sister threatening to not come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is a major event, and the guest list is usually a personal decision for the couple getting married. The author mentions it's an intimate setting with close friends and family. The sister was given a plus one originally because of the previous boyfriend, but now the new one is problematic. The author finds the boyfriend's behavior annoying and not in line with the wedding's vibe.\n\nThe key points are: the author made a decision to remove the plus one, managed to fill the spot with a cousin to avoid financial loss, and the sister is now refusing to attend without her boyfriend. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nI should think about the following aspects:\n1. **Wedding Guest List Control**: The couple typically has the final say on who attends their wedding. It's their event, so they have the right to set the guest list according to their comfort and the event's nature.\n2. **Timing of the Decision**: The post mentions it's last minute, but the author adjusted the guest list by replacing with a cousin. So maybe the timing isn't the main issue here.\n3. **Relationship with the Sister**: If the sister is important, the author might have considered the impact of this decision. However, the author's reasoning is about comfort and the event's intimacy.\n4. **Sister's Reaction**: The sister is threatening not to attend, which is a significant consequence. Is her reaction justified? Maybe she feels her autonomy is being disregarded, but the author's stance is about their own event.\n5. **Circumstances of the Boyfriend**: The boyfriend being unemployed, mooching, and talkative are subjective judgments. The author is making a personal decision based on their perception.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and consequences. The author acted to preserve their own comfort and event's integrity, which is their right. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own event. However, there might be a middle ground, like discussing the issue with the sister first or finding another compromise. But the author did replace the plus one, so they tried to mitigate the problem. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is within their rights to control the guest list. However, some might argue that excluding a family member's partner could be harsh. But given the details, the author's reasoning is valid for their event.\n"
