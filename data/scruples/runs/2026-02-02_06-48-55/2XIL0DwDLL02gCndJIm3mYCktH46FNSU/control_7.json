I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a 27-year-old guy getting married and rescinded his sister's plus one because he doesn't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, weddings are personal events, and the author wants only close people. The sister originally had a plus one when she was with her ex, but after breaking up, the author waited to see who she'd bring. Now the new boyfriend is causing issues: unemployed, mooching, and talks too much. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place, so no money is lost. The sister is upset and might not come without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is responsible for managing the guest list, especially a destination wedding which can be expensive. They want an intimate event with close friends and family. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is trying to avoid a stressful situation. Also, they found a replacement, so the sister isn't left without a plus one, just not her boyfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels like her choice of partner is being policed. They've only been dating six months, so maybe it's a new relationship. The author might be overstepping by making a decision that affects her attendance. The sister's threat to not come shows how important her partner is to her, even if the author doesn't like him.\n\nBut weddings are usually the host's event. The author is paying for it and has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's negative traits could make the wedding uncomfortable for everyone. The author isn't excluding him just because he's the new guy, but due to specific issues. Also, the sister had a plus one before, so it's not like the author is being inconsistent. The cousin is a family member, which fits the close friends and family criteria.\n\nThe sister's reaction might be about feeling disrespected. But the author is managing the guest list, not interfering in her dating life. The key points are the author's right to control the event and the boyfriend's behavior. Since the author found a replacement, it's not purely about money. The sister can bring a cousin instead, which is still a plus one. So the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice.\n"
