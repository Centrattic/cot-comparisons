I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding plus one for the sister's boyfriend. The author, 27M, is getting married and decided to rescind the plus one for his sister's new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to attend if he's not invited. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms around weddings. Typically, the wedding couple has the final say on the guest list. They're the ones organizing the event and spending money, so they usually get to make those decisions. The sister was given a plus one initially, but when the boyfriend changed, the author decided to rescind it. They even found a replacement to avoid losing money. \n\nBut the sister is upset and considering not coming. The key points here are: the sister's boyfriend is unwanted by the immediate family, and the wedding is intended to be intimate. The author's reasoning is about keeping the guest list to close friends and family. \n\nHowever, the sister's reaction is a problem. If by rescinding the plus one, the sister is not attending, that complicates things. The author might be causing a rift with their sister. But is the author in the wrong? \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have the right to control their wedding guest list. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a valid concern. On the other hand, the sister might feel her autonomy is being taken away, especially since the relationship is new. But the author isn't banning the sister; just the plus one. \n\nThe answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they are managing their own event. However, the sister's threat adds a layer. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the optimal solution. So, the author's actions are within their rights, even if it causes conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
