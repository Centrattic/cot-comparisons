I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation is that the user is rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is intimate, only close family and friends. The sister was given a plus one initially because of her previous boyfriend, but after the breakup, they waited. Now the new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The user doesn't want him there, so they rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not attend without him.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Let's think about wedding etiquette. Typically, the hosts decide the guest list, especially for a destination wedding which is more expensive. The user's reasoning is that they want everyone attending to be people they enjoy, keeping it intimate. However, removing a plus one at the last minute can be seen as harsh, especially if the sister feels it's unfair. The sister is threatening to not come, which complicates things. Maybe the user could have talked to the sister first instead of rescinding without discussion? Also, the boyfriend's behavior is an issue, but is it the user's place to judge? \n\nOn the other hand, the user's right to set the guest list is important. If the presence of the boyfriend would make the wedding uncomfortable for them, they have a valid reason. But the sister's reaction is also a factor. Perhaps the user should have handled it differently, but the decision itself might not be wrong. The key is whether the user acted inconsiderately. They tried to find a replacement to avoid financial loss, which is thoughtful. The sister's threat to skip the wedding is a consequence the user might not have anticipated. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being inconsiderate or not communicating is often a factor. Here, the user might not be in the wrong because they have the right to their guest list, but they could have handled it better. However, the answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. In some views, rescinding a plus one without discussing might be inconsiderate. But the user's reasoning is valid. So the answer might be B (No), the user isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
