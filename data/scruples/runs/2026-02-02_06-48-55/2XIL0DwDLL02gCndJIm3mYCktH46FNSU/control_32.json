I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the writer rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The sister originally had a plus one, which was her ex-boyfriend, but after the split, a new guy came into the picture. The writer and their family dislike the new boyfriend: he's unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The writer decided to rescind the plus one and found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Weddings are personal events where the couple usually has the final say on the guest list. The writer is trying to keep it intimate, which is a common reason for limiting guests. The sister's boyfriend is not part of the immediate family, so the writer's decision to exclude him might be within their rights. However, the sister's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening to leave the wedding herself if her partner isn't included. That's a big deal because the sister is family, and the writer might not want to risk her not attending.\n\nBut the writer did offer a compromise by replacing the plus one with a cousin. That shows they tried to be considerate. However, the sister's threat is about her own attendance, which complicates things. The writer might be in a tough spot, but they have the right to set boundaries for their event. On the other hand, excluding someone close to a family member can cause rifts. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. They have the authority over their wedding guest list, but the sister's reaction is extreme. However, the boyfriend's characteristics (unemployed, mooching, talkative) are factors the writer might have valid reasons to dislike. The writer's main concern is about the wedding atmosphere, which is understandable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer not being in the wrong (B), because they have the right to decide who attends their wedding. The sister's threat is more about her own reaction than the writer's action being unjust. The writer tried to find a solution (cousin as replacement), so the issue is more about the sister's response than the writer's decision being wrong.\n"
