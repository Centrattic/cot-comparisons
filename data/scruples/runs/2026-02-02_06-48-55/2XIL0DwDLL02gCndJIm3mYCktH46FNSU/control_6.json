I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person is getting married and had given their sister a plus one initially because she was with her ex, who they liked. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talks too much, mooches off her. The author decided to remove the plus one and found a replacement. The sister is threatening to skip the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether rescinding the plus one is justified. The author's reasoning is that the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they can't stand there. The sister is upset because she's been with the boyfriend for six months, and she feels he should come.\n\nFrom a typical AITA perspective, people often consider the balance between personal boundaries and family relationships. The author isn't necessarily being mean; they're protecting their event. They even managed to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss, which shows consideration. On the other hand, the sister is using a threat to not attend, which is significant because family events are important.\n\nBut weddings are personal, and it's the author's right to decide the guest list. However, cutting off family access might have consequences. But the sister is an adult and could choose to bring the boyfriend at her own expense, even if he's not on the list. However, destination weddings can have strict guest limits, so maybe the plus one wasn't just about preference but about capacity.\n\nThe author's actions are about their comfort and the event's atmosphere. The sister's reaction is intense but not entirely unexpected. In many AITA cases, the person who makes a decision to protect their own space is often seen as not in the wrong, especially if steps are taken to mitigate issues. The sister's threat seems more about leverage than a reasonable request.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to set boundaries for their wedding. The sister's reaction is her problem, not the author's responsibility.\n"
