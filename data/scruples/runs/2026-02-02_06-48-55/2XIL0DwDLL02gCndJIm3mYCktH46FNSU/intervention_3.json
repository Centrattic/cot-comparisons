I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old man, rescinded his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he isn't included. The author's reasoning is that the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family, and the boyfriend is disliked because he's unemployed, talks too much, and seems to mooch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author gave the sister a plus one originally because of her ex-boyfriend, but when she got a new one, they didn't like him. The author made a decision to remove the plus one, even though it's last minute. The sister is now upset and might not come. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host (the author) has the right to decide who attends. However, there's the aspect of family. The sister is family, so cutting off her plus one might strain their relationship. But the author's main point is about maintaining an intimate setting. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern\u2014maybe it's valid that he would be a problem at the wedding. \n\nHowever, the sister's reaction is also notable. Threatening to skip the wedding is a big deal. But maybe she feels it's unfair for her partner to be excluded without discussion. The author didn't communicate this before making the decision? The post says they \"decided that we cannot stand her new boyfriend\" and then rescinded the plus one. Did they talk to the sister first? If they just made the decision without discussing, that could be a mistake. \n\nAlso, the sister's boyfriend has been in the relationship for six months, which isn't that long. But six months is enough to bring someone to a wedding. The author's justification is about the wedding's vibe. However, excluding a family member's partner could be seen as harsh. Even if the author has the final say on the guest list, the sister might feel disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did arrange for a cousin to take the seat, so there's no financial loss. That's a responsible move. But the sister's exclusion is a bigger issue. Maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister first, perhaps set some boundaries before the decision. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their concerns and just took the plus one away unilaterally. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had valid concerns about the boyfriend's behavior that could disrupt the wedding, then it's understandable. But the sister's reaction is also about her partner being excluded, which is a personal matter. The author has to balance their own comfort with family dynamics. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if someone is threatening to skip a family event because of another's decision, it's a tough spot. But the author might be seen as in the right if they have a good reason. However, the lack of communication and the sister's possible feelings of being disrespected could tip it the other way. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't discuss the issue with their sister before rescinding the plus one, leading to a potential family conflict. But if the author had a valid reason and the sister is being unreasonable, it might be B. But the sister is family, so their relationship is important. The author's action could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over family unity, which is a common AITA scenario. So probably A.\n"
