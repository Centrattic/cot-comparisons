I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the new boyfriend. The situation is that the sister had a previous boyfriend who was invited, but now she has a new one that the family doesn't like. The author decided to remove the plus one, causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they don't get along with there. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't included. The author found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider etiquette and fairness. Weddings can be personal events where the host has control over the guest list. However, rescinding a plus one for a close family member, especially last-minute, might be seen as harsh. The sister might feel that her relationship is being judged or dismissed. Even though the author has their reasons, the sister's response is about her own relationship choice. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's employment status and behavior are mentioned, but that's subjective. The author might believe these are valid concerns, but others might see it as unfair to exclude someone based on that. The sister's threat to not attend is a strong reaction, which complicates things. \n\nI think the author has a right to decide the guest list, but excluding someone because they dislike them, even if it's a sister's partner, could be seen as inconsiderate. It might create family conflict that overshadows the wedding. The author's priority is their own comfort, but they need to weigh that against their sister's feelings. Maybe a compromise was possible, but it's unclear. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. However, since the author made a unilateral decision without considering the sister's perspective, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the wedding is supposed to be intimate and the boyfriend is not part of their close circle, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer depends on how one values personal comfort vs. family relationships.\n"
