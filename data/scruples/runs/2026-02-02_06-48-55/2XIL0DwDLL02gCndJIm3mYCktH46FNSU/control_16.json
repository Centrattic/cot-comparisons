I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer (27M) rescinded their sister's (24F) plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is a destination event, which likely involves significant costs. The original plus one was given when the sister had a previous boyfriend. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The writer wants to maintain an intimate setting with close friends and family.\n\nThe key points here are: the writer made a decision based on their own comfort and the wedding's atmosphere. They found a replacement (the cousin) to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset because she feels the boyfriend should come, leading to a potential conflict over attendance.\n\nNow, considering common AITA scenarios, people often prioritize their own event's comfort. The writer isn't banning the sister but the boyfriend, which could be seen as reasonable if the boyfriend's behavior would disrupt the event. However, the sister's threat to not attend complicates things. The writer might be seen as overstepping if they didn't communicate concerns earlier or if the sister's inclusion is important for family harmony.\n\nBut on the other hand, the writer has the right to set boundaries for their own wedding. The boyfriend's negative traits (unemployed, mooch, talkative) are valid concerns for a small, intimate event. The writer acted to maintain their desired atmosphere and found a replacement, which is thoughtful.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The sister's boyfriend is her partner, so excluding him might be harsh. Also, the sister's threat to not attend could cause bigger issues. But the writer's intention is to avoid discomfort during the event, which is their right.\n\nIn many AITA cases, the person setting boundaries for their event is often seen as not in the wrong, especially if they handle it respectfully. The writer did find a replacement, showing consideration for costs. The sister's reaction might be disproportionate, but the writer's decision is about personal preference.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide the guest list for their wedding, especially for a plus one that was given conditionally based on the previous relationship. The key is that the writer made a choice to ensure their event is comfortable for them and their close ones, which is their prerogative.\n"
