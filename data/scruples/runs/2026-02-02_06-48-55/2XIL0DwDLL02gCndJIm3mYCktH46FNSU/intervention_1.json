I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is planning a destination wedding in the Caribbean. They originally gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend that the author's family doesn't like. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid losing money, and the sister is threatening not to come if he's not included. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the usual expectations around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are family events, and the couple often has some say in who attends, especially if it's a destination wedding which can be expensive and more exclusive. The author's reasoning is about maintaining an intimate setting. Plus Ones are typically at the discretion of the couple, and if the sister is attending, the boyfriend might not be the main issue. But the key here is that the author is removing the plus one after the sister has already found someone. \n\nHowever, the sister is now saying she won't come without her boyfriend. This complicates things. If the author removes the plus one, the sister might not attend, which could be hurtful. But is the author justified in their decision? The boyfriend is unemployed, possibly mooching, and very talkative. These are personal judgments, but maybe the author is overstepping. \n\nWait, the author says \"we\" (implying their family) don't like the new boyfriend. The sister might feel disrespected if her partner is not allowed. Even if the relationship is new, it's her choice to bring him. The author could have discussed the issue with the sister first instead of unilaterally rescinding the plus one. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wants to keep it intimate. Maybe the cousin is a better fit. But is the problem the sister or the boyfriend? The sister is being stubborn by threatening not to come. The author might have the right to set the guest list, but rescinding the plus one without communication could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn many cases, weddings are about the couple's preferences. The author might not be in the wrong if they made a decision to keep the guest list small. But the sister is a family member, so her absence could be a bigger issue. The timing is last minute, which might be rude. The author could have tried to address the concerns with the sister first, maybe express why the boyfriend's presence is an issue and see if there's a compromise. \n\nBut the boyfriend's behavior could be a valid reason. The author might be within their rights to not have someone who disrupts the event. However, the sister is also upset, which might be a consequence the author didn't consider. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the dynamics of their family. \n\nIn the end, the author made a decision without prior discussion, which could be seen as selfish. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's approach might be what caused the conflict. So, maybe the author is in the wrong in how they handled it, even if their reasoning is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
