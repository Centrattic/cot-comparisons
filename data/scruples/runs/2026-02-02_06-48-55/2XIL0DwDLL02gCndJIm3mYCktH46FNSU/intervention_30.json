I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if she can't bring him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother initially gave his sister a plus one when she was with her ex, who they liked. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, and seems to mooch off her, plus is very talkative. The brother doesn't want him at the wedding, so he rescinds the plus one, finds a replacement (his cousin), to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and says she won't attend without her boyfriend.\n\nThe main issue is whether the brother overstepped by removing the plus one. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for hosts to have some control over the guest list, especially if they're paying for it. The brother wants an intimate setting with close friends and family. The sister's boyfriend's behavior sounds problematic, so the brother might feel justified in wanting to exclude him.\n\nHowever, the sister is being asked to leave her partner out, which could be seen as a significant boundary. Even though the couple has only been together six months, the sister might feel that her partner is part of her life now, and excluding him is a personal slight. The brother's decision could cause a rift between siblings, which is a big deal.\n\nOn one hand, the brother has the right to set the guest list for his wedding. On the other, the sister is being asked to choose between her partner and the wedding. The timing is also a factor\u2014it's last minute, so the brother is trying to minimize costs by replacing the plus one with a cousin. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it fair to exclude someone based on personal dislike without a valid reason? The boyfriend's unemployment and mooching might be valid concerns, but that's subjective. The brother might have other reasons for not wanting him there. The sister's threat to not attend is a strong reaction, but if the wedding is a family event, maybe the brother is within his rights.\n\nI think the brother is not in the wrong because he's organizing the wedding and has the right to control the guest list. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the brother's actions could still be seen as overreaching by removing her plus one, which is a significant decision affecting her. However, given the context of the problematic boyfriend, it's a judgment call. The answer might lean towards the brother not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances.\n"
