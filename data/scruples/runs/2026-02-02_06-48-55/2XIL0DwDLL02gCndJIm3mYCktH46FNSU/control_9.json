I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding. The sister's new boyfriend is described as problematic: unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author wanted to keep the wedding intimate, and the sister is now threatening not to attend if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual rules around weddings. Typically, the person who is getting married has control over the guest list. It's their event, and they choose who attends. But there's also family dynamics to consider. The sister isn't being excluded; she's just losing a plus one. The author replaced the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which is thoughtful.\n\nThe sister's reaction is intense. Threatening not to come because her boyfriend can't attend might be overreacting. However, family relationships can be complicated. The author's reasoning is about maintaining an intimate setting and avoiding someone they disagree with. But is it fair to exclude someone because the family members don't like them, especially if they haven't done anything wrong?\n\nWait, the boyfriend's behavior is described as negative, but is that enough to justify exclusion? If the boyfriend is a valid concern (like being a mooch and talkative), maybe the author has a point. But the sister's reaction could be damaging. The author might be in the right for wanting a comfortable environment but might be causing a rift with their sister. However, the sister's threat is her own choice, and the author isn't forcing her to stay away.\n\nIn many cases, weddings are personal events, and the couple has the final say. So the author isn't in the wrong for choosing the guest list. The sister's reaction is her own issue. The answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
