I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding is in April, a destination one in the Caribbean. They gave the sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now that she has a new boyfriend, the family (immediate) doesn't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed, 31, and talks non-stop, making conversation hard. The author decided to cut him off, got a cousin to replace him to avoid losing money, but the sister might not come if he's excluded. The author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasoning and the potential consequences. The author is concerned about the wedding being intimate and not wanting people who are hard to get along with. The sister is upset because she feels the boyfriend should be included, even though they've only been dating for six months.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, typically, when giving a plus one, especially for a destination wedding, it's expected that the person attending brings someone they are committed to. But six months might be a bit short for that expectation. However, the author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. If the boyfriend is disruptive (unemployed, mooching, talks non-stop), then the author might have a valid reason to not want him there, given the intimate setting.\n\nBut is it fair to rescind a plus one at this late stage? The sister might feel that the invitation is still open, and the author is being unreasonable. The author tried to get a cousin to cover the cost, which might prevent financial loss, but the sister might feel it's about the principle. The author's right to set guest requirements for their wedding is important, but maybe the timing is an issue. If the sister had to make travel arrangements, she might be inconvenienced by the last-minute change.\n\nAlso, considering the sister's perspective: if they've been dating six months, she might see him as part of her life now. The author's immediate family not liking him could be a problem, but the decision is the author's. However, maybe there's a way to address the issues without excluding him. For example, setting boundaries on how much he talks or ensuring he's employed isn't necessarily their family's responsibility.\n\nSo, the author's action is about personal preference and the event's atmosphere. But is it fair to exclude someone based on their behavior that the author perceives as problematic? The boyfriend isn't part of the family, so the author might not have the right to judge his employment status or his conversational habits. However, if the author is inviting only close friends and family, they might have a right to set who they think is appropriate.\n\nBut the sister's threat to not attend is a big consequence. The author is trying to maintain an intimate setting, but maybe they should have communicated earlier about their expectations for a plus one. Now that it's last minute, rescinding the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reasons are reasonable. The boyfriend's unemployment and talkativeness are personal issues, but perhaps the author should have discussed their concerns with the sister first instead of unilaterally rescinding the plus one. The sister might feel that her new partner is being unfairly singled out, especially if the author had no issues with the previous plus one. Also, six months is a relatively short time in a relationship, so expecting him to be included might not be unreasonable.\n\nThe problem is the timing and the approach. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting someone disruptive at their wedding, but the way they handled it could be the issue. By not discussing it with the sister and making a unilateral decision, they might have overstepped. The sister's potential absence is a significant outcome, so maybe the author should have considered alternatives, like setting rules for the guest's behavior rather than removing the plus one.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, plus one policies can vary. Some weddings are strict, others more flexible. If the author's wedding is designed to be intimate, they might have the right to limit guests. But the sister was already invited, and the plus one was given. Changing it now could be seen as causing unnecessary stress. The author's solution to get a cousin to cover the cost is good to prevent financial loss, but the sister's emotional reaction is valid. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to set the guest list for their own wedding. However, the sister's feelings are hurt, and the author's timing and method could be problematic. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the author's decision to exclude the boyfriend, which is their right, but the sister's possible reaction is a consequence they need to consider. The author's reasoning about the plus one being for close friends and family could justify their decision. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
