I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend at their wedding.\n\nFirst, the wedding is the author's, so they probably have the final say on guests. They mention it's an intimate setting with close friends and family. The sister had a previous boyfriend they liked, but the new one is causing issues. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch, and is overly talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one and found a replacement (their cousin) to avoid financial loss. The sister is now threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to enjoy the wedding and maintain the intimate atmosphere. The sister being upset is a consequence. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the wedding is the author's event, so they have the authority to set the guest list. They made a last-minute change but covered the cost, which is thoughtful. The boyfriend's behavior might be disruptive. On the other hand, the sister may feel disrespected, especially since they'd been dating six months. The author's decision could damage their relationship with their sister. \n\nBut the key points are: the author's right to control their wedding, the sister's reaction being extreme (not attending), and the boyfriend's questionable traits. The author tried to mitigate costs by replacing him with a cousin. So, while it's a tough call, the author's main event and the guest list being their choice might mean they're not in the wrong. The sister's threat to not come is a bigger issue. So answer B.\n"
