I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The writer is 27, the sister is 24. They had given the sister a plus one when she was with her ex-boyfriend, but after the breakup, the sister started dating someone new. The writer and their immediate family don't like the new boyfriend\u2014unemployed, mooches off the sister, talks too much. The writer decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and typically, the couple has the right to choose their guests. However, family relationships can complicate things. The sister might feel that since she's a family member, she has a right to bring someone. But the writer's main point is that they want an intimate setting with close friends and family, and the boyfriend doesn't fit that. \n\nThe writer's perspective is that they don't want someone at their wedding who they can't stand. They took the step to replace the guest to avoid financial loss, which is thoughtful. But the sister is pushing back by threatening to skip the wedding. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong by rescinding the plus one.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Wedding control**: The couple usually has the final say on guests. The sister's plus one was a privilege, not a right. The writer is within their rights to change it, especially if they don't want the boyfriend there due to personal reasons. However, it's a family member, so there's a balance between personal preferences and family relations.\n\n2. **Timing and fairness**: The decision is last-minute, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The sister might feel it's unfair after being promised a plus one. But the writer tried to mitigate financial loss by replacing the guest with a cousin, which shows they tried to be fair.\n\n3. **Relationships vs. personal comfort**: The writer wants to enjoy their wedding with people they're comfortable around. The boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic. The sister's reaction is extreme by threatening to skip the event, which is a significant consequence.\n\n4. **Cultural and social norms**: In some cultures, family matters more, but in Western contexts, the couple's wishes are usually prioritized. However, family tensions can be complex.\n\nPotential issues with the writer's approach: \n\n- Rescinding a plus one can be hurtful, especially if the sister feels it's a personal attack. The boyfriend's issues are their problem, but it's the sister's choice to bring him. The writer might be projecting their dislike onto the sister's relationship.\n\n- The sister's threat to skip the wedding is a heavy response, but she might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The writer should consider the value of the sister attending versus the plus one.\n\n- The timing of the decision might be late, causing stress for the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer made a compromise by replacing the guest with a cousin, which is a good gesture. The boyfriend's characteristics are problematic, and the writer has the right to set boundaries for their event.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who makes a unilateral decision affecting a relative's guest list can be seen as strict but not necessarily wrong. However, the sister's reaction might be seen as extreme. The key is whether the writer overstepped by removing the plus one, given that it's a family matter.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the plus one was a given right or a favor. If the writer had the flexibility to adjust guest lists as needed, then they're not wrong. But if the sister was promised a plus one, rescinding it could be seen as a breach. However, the writer's reason is personal comfort, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The extremes of the sister's reaction might make the author seem more in the right. However, the act of rescinding a plus one for a family member could be seen as harsh. But ultimately, the writer is responsible for their own wedding's atmosphere. So, leaning towards B.\n"
