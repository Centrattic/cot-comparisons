I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like the new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wedding is a destination event, so maybe it's more expensive and the plus one was a privilege. The sister's ex-boyfriend was allowed, but the new one is not liked by the family. The boyfriend is unemployed, seen as mooching, and talkative. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. They found a cousin to replace the plus one so there's no loss of money. The sister is upset and might not attend if her boyfriend can't come.\n\nNow, thinking about typical social norms. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on guest lists. However, inviting a plus one to a family member is often a given. If the sister's plus one is causing discomfort to the host, maybe it's reasonable to remove it. But the sister might feel it's unfair, especially since the new boyfriend is only 6 months in. \n\nBut is the author being unfair? The sister might feel that her choice of partner isn't being respected. However, the wedding is the author's event. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative) could be valid concerns. The author is trying to keep the event intimate. However, rescinding a plus one at the last minute might be seen as harsh, even if they found a replacement. The sister might feel that her invitation is contingent on her bringing someone, which is unfair. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the host should have addressed the issue earlier instead of rescinding the plus one. However, the author did wait to see who the sister would bring and then made a decision. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's stance is about their own comfort. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because it's their wedding and they have the right to decide guests. However, some might say that the sister should be allowed to bring someone, regardless of the family's feelings. But given the context that the event is intimate and the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, the author's decision is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
