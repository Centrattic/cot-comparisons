I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author rescinded their sister's plus one to the wedding because they dislike her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening to skip the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The author mentions it's an intimate setting with close friends and family. The sister was given a plus one initially, but after a breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now, the new boyfriend is problematic: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author doesn't want him there, and they found a cousin to take his place to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and might not attend without him.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to control the guest list. If the plus one is causing discomfort to the host and their family, it's reasonable to remove them. The author did make an effort to replace the guest, so there's no financial loss. On the other hand, the sister feels that her relationship is being judged, and the boyfriend is only 6 months into the relationship. Maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier or communicated better. However, the sister's reaction of threatening not to attend is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate someone they don't want there. The key points are the author's right to the guest list and the sister's overreaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
