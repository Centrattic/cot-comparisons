I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (27M) rescinded their sister's (24F) plus one to the wedding because they dislike her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not attend if he can't come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The author had given the sister a plus one before, but when the sister started dating someone new, the author decided to rescind that invitation. The reasons given are that the boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author replaced the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and threatening not to come if the boyfriend is excluded.\n\nThe key points to consider: the author's right to control the guest list vs. the sister's feelings and her choice to attend with her partner. The sister has been given a plus one in the past, which the author now wants to revoke. The timing is last minute, which could be a problem. The sister's new relationship is only six months, which some might say is too new for a plus one, but that's subjective.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about the wedding being intimate with close friends and family. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern for the atmosphere. However, the sister's reaction suggests that the boyfriend is important to her, and excluding him might cause a bigger conflict. \n\nPotential arguments for the author: They have the right to their own wedding environment and can choose guests. The boyfriend's traits are problematic for the event's vibe. They found a replacement to cover costs.\n\nArguments against: The decision is last minute and could harm the sister's attendance. The sister might feel disrespected, especially if she's in a new relationship. The author might be overstepping by judging the sister's partner, even if it's for the wedding. It's possible the sister was relying on bringing her partner, and the author's decision is causing her stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal, so the host has control. However, the way the author handled it might be seen as dismissive of their sister's relationship. If the sister is willing to not attend because of this, it's a family issue that could have lasting effects. The author might not be in the wrong for controlling the guest list, but the handling could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister's decision to bring the boyfriend is her personal choice. The timing and the sister's threat to not come might indicate that the author's decision is causing more harm than good, but legally and in terms of wedding rights, the author is in control. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a strict wedding planning perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. But from a relationship and family respect perspective, there's a case where the author could be seen as overstepping. But since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but others might differ. The answer would depend on societal norms and how strict one is on guest list control vs. family dynamics.\n"
