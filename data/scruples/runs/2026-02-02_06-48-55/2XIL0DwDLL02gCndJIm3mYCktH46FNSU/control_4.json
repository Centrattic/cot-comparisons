I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is a guy getting married and he rescinded his sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not included.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the rules around wedding invitations. Usually, wedding guests are close family and friends. If the author gave his sister a plus one, that's typically for her partner or a close friend. But the sister has a new boyfriend now, and the author and their family don't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author wants to exclude him to keep the wedding intimate. \n\nBut the sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. So, is it fair for the author to rescind the plus one? \n\nOn one hand, weddings are supposed to be about the couple, and they have the right to control the guest list. If the boyfriend is causing issues or doesn't fit the intimate theme, the author might be justified. On the other hand, the sister is being excluded because of her partner, which could make her feel like the wedding is against her. But the author's main concern is enjoying the event with people they like. \n\nI should also consider if the sister was given a plus one as part of the original plan. If the previous boyfriend was included and now they're replacing him, maybe the author is within their rights. But the sister might feel that a new partner in a 6-month relationship deserves to be included. However, the author's reasoning is about their comfort and the intimacy of the event. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to have a comfortable guest list and the sister's reaction. The author isn't excluding the sister herself, just the boyfriend. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decide who attends their wedding.\n"
