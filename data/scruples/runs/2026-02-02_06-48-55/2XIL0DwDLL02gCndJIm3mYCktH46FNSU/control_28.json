I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (27M) is getting married and decided to rescind his sister's (24F) plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if he's not included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules about plus ones. Usually, plus ones are given to guests so they can bring someone they're close to. If the author gave the plus one to his sister, that's their decision. But now they want to rescind it because of their dislike of the boyfriend. The key points here are the timing (last minute), the sister's reaction, and the reason for rescinding.\n\nTiming is important. The wedding is in early April, and this is a destination wedding, which is more expensive and logistically complex. The author mentions they found a cousin to fill in so no money is lost, so they didn't leave a seat empty. But rescinding a plus one so close to the event might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister and boyfriend have already made plans.\n\nThe reason given is that the boyfriend is unemployed, talks too much, and is a mooch. But is that a valid reason? The author's personal dislike might be a factor, but weddings are about celebrating the couple, and it's their right to choose their guests. However, the sister's plus one is tied to her attendance. If the sister is threatening not to come, that's a big deal because losing a family member at a wedding could be more problematic than having someone they don't like.\n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship is six months. Some people might say it's too early for a plus one, but the sister might see it as important. The author's stance is about keeping the wedding intimate with close friends and family. But the boyfriend is the sister's partner, so excluding him could be hurtful.\n\nThere's a conflict between the author's desire for an intimate wedding and the sister's need to bring her partner. The author's right to set the guest list versus the sister's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to control the guest list, but the sister's threat to not attend is a consequence they might not want.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cases, family members might be allowed to bring someone even if the host doesn't like them, especially if it's a close relative. The author might have overstepped by rescinding the plus one, leading to the sister's anger. Alternatively, the author might be justified if the guest list is supposed to be intimate and the boyfriend's behavior is a concern.\n\nAnother angle: the author changed their mind after the relationship started. If they initially gave the plus one with the previous boyfriend, then when the new one came, they rescinded. The sister might feel that since the previous boyfriend was allowed, the new one should be too. The author's inconsistency might be an issue.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The author has the right to choose the guest list but might not have considered the sister's feelings enough. The sister's threat is a significant consequence. So, could the author be in the wrong for changing the decision last minute and causing the sister to possibly miss the wedding?\n"
