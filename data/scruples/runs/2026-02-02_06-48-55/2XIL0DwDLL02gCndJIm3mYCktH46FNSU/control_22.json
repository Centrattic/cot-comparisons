I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (27M) has rescinded their sister's (24F) plus one to the wedding because they can't stand her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wedding is a destination event in the Caribbean, which is probably expensive. The sister originally had a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend, but after the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative, dominating conversations. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid financial loss. The sister is now refusing to come if he's not invited, saying they've been dating six months.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context of weddings and guest lists. Typically, weddings are personal events where the couple has the right to set their guest list. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister is an invited guest, so she has a plus one by default. The issue arises when the plus one is someone the family doesn't like. The author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family, and they can't enjoy the event if this person is there.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels that her boyfriend should be allowed, even though they've only been dating six months. The author made a last-minute change, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but they did find a replacement to avoid financial issues. The sister threatening to not attend is a strong reaction, possibly because she feels her autonomy is being challenged.\n\nFactors to consider: The author has the right to control the guest list, but the sister is family. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern. The six-month relationship might be a point\u2014some might argue it's too short to bring to a wedding, while others might say if it's serious, it should be included. The author's actions are to maintain their desired atmosphere, which is understandable. However, the sister's threat to miss the wedding complicates things. The author might be seen as prioritizing their comfort over family, which could be viewed as harsh. But the sister's reaction is also extreme.\n\nPotential angles: The author isn't wrong because they have the right to their guest list. However, rescinding a plus one close to the event and causing a rift with a sibling could be seen as inconsiderate. The boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern, but the sister's refusal to attend might be disproportionate. The financial replacement helps, but it's a destination wedding, so maybe other people are already committed. The author might not be in the wrong, but they need to handle the sister's feelings carefully. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, weddings are personal, and the couple's preferences are usually respected. However, excluding someone close because of disapproval of a partner can create family issues. The author's stance is about maintaining the event's integrity, while the sister is asserting her right to attend with her partner. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set the guest list, especially if the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. However, the sister's reaction is extreme. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
