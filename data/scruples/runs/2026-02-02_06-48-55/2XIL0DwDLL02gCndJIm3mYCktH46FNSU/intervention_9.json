I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 27M, getting married in April. They gave their sister, who's 24F, a plus one to the wedding. Originally, the sister had a previous boyfriend who was more liked, but they broke up. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like. The author decides to rescind the plus one for the new boyfriend, even though they found a substitute (their cousin) to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and says she won't come if the boyfriend isn't included. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The wedding is the author's event, so they have the right to decide who attends. But the sister is a close relative, and the question is about the plus one. The sister's boyfriend is the issue. The author's reasoning is about wanting everyone at the wedding to be people they enjoy having there, especially since it's an intimate event. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't included, which complicates things.\n\nNow, thinking about the arguments for the author being in the wrong (A). One point is that the sister is attending, and the author is prioritizing their dislike of the boyfriend over the sister's attendance. The sister might feel that her relationship with the boyfriend is important, and the author is making a last-minute change that affects her. Also, the boyfriend hasn't done anything to disqualify himself, so the author's judgment is based on their family's dislike. Maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister first instead of making the decision unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's side (B) could argue that it's their wedding, and they should be comfortable with all guests. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. These are legitimate concerns for the author wanting to keep the event intimate and pleasant. The fact that they found a substitute (cousin) to avoid financial loss suggests they tried to make it right. They might feel that the sister's threat is unreasonable, as the sister can attend without the boyfriend.\n\nAnother angle is cultural or familial norms. In some families, the host (author) might have the final say on the guest list. But others might expect that immediate family members can bring a partner regardless. The sister's reaction could be seen as extreme, but also, maybe the author should have considered the sister's feelings more.\n\nAlso, the timing is last minute. The author might have realized the boyfriend is a problem too late, but they took steps to mitigate costs. The sister's threat to not attend if the boyfriend can't come is a significant consequence. The author might be causing a rift in the family for their own comfort, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are the author's right to control the guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. The sister's boyfriend is disliked but not necessarily a bad person. The author's reasons are subjective but valid. The sister's threat is a heavy price to pay. \n\nIn many cases, weddings are about the couple's preferences, so the author's stance is defensible. However, the sister's attendance is also a family matter. The author might be in the right by prioritizing their own comfort, but the sister might feel disrespected. It's a tough call. If the author had communicated better, maybe there's room for compromise. But as it stands, the author made a decision based on their own judgment, which is their right. However, the sister's reaction is also a factor. If the author values the sister's presence, maybe they should reconsider. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the right to control the guest list, then B (No) makes sense. If it's about family respect and last-minute changes, then A (Yes). \n\nI think the primary responsibility is on the host of the wedding (the author) to have a guest list they're comfortable with. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
