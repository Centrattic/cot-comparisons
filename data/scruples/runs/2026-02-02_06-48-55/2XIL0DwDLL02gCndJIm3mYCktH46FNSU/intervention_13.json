I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (27M) is getting married and had given his sister (24F) a plus one. The sister's previous boyfriend was okay, but now she's with a new guy they don't like. The author decided to rescind the plus one, causing the sister to threaten not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that they designed an intimate wedding with close friends and family and don't want someone they can't stand there. The sister feels the boyfriend deserves to be there since they've only been dating six months. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is the one making the final decisions about their wedding guest list, especially since it's their event and they covered the costs. However, the sister is being excluded from the event entirely because of the rescinded plus one. That's a big consequence for her. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author could argue that they have the right to choose their guests. The sister's response is extreme\u2014threatening not to attend if the boyfriend is excluded. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first or finding a compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her personal life is being judged. The boyfriend's issues (unemployed, talkative) are the author's personal opinions and might not be valid reasons, especially since they only date six months. The author is making a judgment based on their own preferences, which might be unfair. \n\nHowever, the core of the issue is the author's right to their wedding guest list. Even if their reasoning is flawed, they are within their rights to exclude someone. The sister's reaction is problematic too. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, excluding a relative's partner can be sensitive, but the author isn't excluding the sister herself, just the boyfriend. The sister is choosing to not attend over the plus one. The author might have handled it better by communicating earlier or perhaps allowing the sister to attend without the boyfriend. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to manage their guest list. The sister is overreacting by threatening to miss the wedding. However, some might argue that the author is being too judgmental about the boyfriend. But the key point is the right to exclude guests. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
