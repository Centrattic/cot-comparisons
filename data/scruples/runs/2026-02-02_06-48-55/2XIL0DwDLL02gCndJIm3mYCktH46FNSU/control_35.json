I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where the author, a 27-year-old male, has rescinded his sister's plus one to his destination wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not attend if the boyfriend isn't included. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author originally gave the sister a plus one when she was with her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding, so he rescinds the plus one and finds a cousin to take the spot. The sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend can't come.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that it's an intimate wedding with close friends and family, and he wants everyone at the wedding to be people he can enjoy. The sister has been dating this guy for 6 months. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the right to decide the guest list. But there's a family dynamic here. The sister might feel that her boyfriend is important to her, even if they've only been dating a short time. The author is prioritizing his comfort at his own wedding, which is understandable. However, rescinding a plus one so close to the event might be seen as last-minute and causing stress. Also, the sister might feel that her autonomy is being undermined, especially if she's an adult. \n\nBut the author did replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which is a thoughtful move. The issue is whether the author overstepped by removing the boyfriend. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, so he has control. On the other hand, the sister might feel her relationship is being judged or dismissed. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative) are subjective; others might find him fine. The author's family doesn't like him, but that's not the same as the person being bad. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being malicious; he just doesn't want someone who makes him uncomfortable. But the sister is making a stand, which complicates things. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family expectations. However, the author did act unilaterally without considering the sister's perspective. Maybe a middle ground could have been found, but the author decided not to invite the boyfriend. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's organizing the wedding and has the final say. However, some might argue that he should have discussed it more with his sister or found a compromise. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The sister's threat to not attend is a consequence, but the author's decision is about his own comfort in his event. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's managing his wedding guest list as he sees fit, even if it causes tension.\n"
