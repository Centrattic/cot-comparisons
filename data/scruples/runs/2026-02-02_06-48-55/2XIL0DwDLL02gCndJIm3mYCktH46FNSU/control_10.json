I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one. The situation is that the sister's new boyfriend is really disliked by the family, and they decided to exclude him from the wedding. The sister is now threatening to not come if he can't attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider wedding etiquette. Usually, the couple gets to decide who attends their wedding. They have the right to create a guest list that they're comfortable with. The sister's plus one was given originally because they liked her ex, but when the new boyfriend came in, they didn't like him. The author feels that the boyfriend is a problem\u2014unemployed, talkative, mooching. They even managed to get a replacement (the cousin) so no money is lost. \n\nBut the sister is upset and might not come. The question is whether the author is wrong in rescinding the plus one. On one hand, the couple's wedding is their event, and they should be able to exclude people if they feel it's necessary for their comfort. On the other hand, the sister is a family member, and cutting off her plus one might affect her attendance. The sister's threat to not come could create family tension, but the author wants an intimate gathering with close friends and family. \n\nI think the key points are the couple's right to the guest list and the sister's possible overreaction. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting everyone they invite to be someone they can enjoy. The sister should have considered that when choosing to bring someone to a family event. The answer probably leans towards the author not being wrong, but maybe there's a nuance in handling it more gracefully. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the handling. So answer B (No).\n"
