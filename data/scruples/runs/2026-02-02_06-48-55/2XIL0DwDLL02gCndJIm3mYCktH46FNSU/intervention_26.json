I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is getting married and had initially given their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The sister brought a new guy, and the author and their family don't like him. The author decided to take back the plus one and found a cousin to replace him to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze this. \n\nLet's consider the key points. The author's rationale is that they want the wedding to be an intimate event with people they enjoy. They feel the boyfriend isn't a good fit. However, the sister is upset because she's been with the boyfriend for six months and feels he should be there. \n\nWeddings are personal, and the host usually has final say over the guest list. But there's the aspect of family dynamics. The sister is being excluded from the wedding entirely if she can't bring her boyfriend. That's a big consequence. The author's action affects the sister's attendance. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? They might have valid reasons for not wanting the boyfriend there, especially if he's disruptive. But rescinding a plus one so close to the wedding and causing the sister to potentially not attend\u2014could that be too harsh? \n\nAlso, the timing is a factor. It's last minute, which adds stress. The author tried to mitigate financial loss by replacing the guest. However, the sister's threat to skip the wedding shows the impact of this decision on family relationships. \n\nIn many cases, family comes first, even with disagreements. If the author's main concern is enjoying their wedding, maybe they could have found another solution, like having a private conversation with the sister about their concerns before making the final decision. \n\nBut the author's responsibility is to their own comfort and the event's atmosphere. If they feel the boyfriend's presence would ruin the experience, they might have a point. Still, the sister's reaction is a significant consequence. \n\nIt's a tough balance. The author's actions are causing family tension. Maybe they should have considered the sister's feelings more before rescinding. But if the sister is unwilling to attend without her boyfriend, the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own event. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable given their goals for the wedding and if they handled it in a considerate way. They might not be in the wrong because they can set the guest list, but they might have mishandled the communication, leading to the sister's threat. However, the sister's reaction could also be seen as an overreaction. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key is whether the wedding should be a place where the host can feel comfortable, even if it means family members have to make adjustments. The sister's choice to not attend if her boyfriend can't is her decision, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate that.\n"
