I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe person is 27M, about to get married in April. They had given their sister a plus one for the destination wedding in the Caribbean. Originally, the sister's old boyfriend was the plus one because they liked him. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring next. Now, she's with a new guy, and the author's immediate family doesn't like him. The boyfriend is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative, making it hard to get a word in. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take the spot to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of family weddings and plus one policies. Usually, in weddings, guests are close friends and family. The author designed it as an intimate setting. The sister had a plus one before, but now the new boyfriend is problematic. The author's family doesn't like him for specific reasons: unemployed, mooching, and being loud. \n\nThe author's main point is that they want to enjoy the event, which is about their own wedding with close people. They took steps to avoid financial loss by replacing the plus one with a cousin. However, the sister is now threatening not to attend, which is a significant consequence.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n- The author's right to set boundaries for their own wedding. Weddings are personal events; the host can choose guests to ensure comfort.\n- The sister's right to bring someone she's in a relationship with, especially after being allowed a plus one before.\n- The suddenness of the decision\u2014last minute changes might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they tried to avoid financial loss.\n- The sister's potential feeling of being shamed or excluded, which could strain their relationship.\n- The boyfriend's behavior is an issue for the author's family; maybe the sister should have considered that before bringing him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Arguments for A (they are in the wrong) might be that excluding someone from a family event because of personal dislike could be seen as harsh, especially if the relationship is new (6 months). Also, the sister might feel her autonomy is being denied. \n\nArguments for B (they are not in the wrong) would focus on the author's right to have a comfortable event. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author has the right to set the guest list to maintain the intimate vibe they wanted. They also tried to handle it respectfully by replacing the plus one with a cousin.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some cultures, weddings are strictly about the couple's preferences, and in others, family might have more say. Since it's a destination wedding, which is more intimate and likely more controlled by the couple, the author's decision might be more acceptable. However, the sister's threat to not attend complicates things. If the sister doesn't come, that's a loss for the author as well. \n\nAnother point: the sister had a prior plus one with a previous boyfriend. The author's family liked that one. The current boyfriend is different. So maybe the author's family had reasonable concerns. The boyfriend's unemployment and behavior could be valid reasons to question his inclusion, especially in a small, close-knit event.\n\nBut the sister might feel that her personal life choices are being judged. The author is making a decision based on their own comfort, which is understandable, but it's a family matter. The sister is an adult, and the author might not have the right to dictate who she can or can't bring, even if it's their wedding. However, the wedding is the author's event, so they do have control over the guest list.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance between respecting the author's right to their own event and the sister's autonomy. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable if they're trying to maintain a comfortable environment. However, the way they rescinded the plus one at last minute might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they tried to mitigate the financial loss. The sister's reaction is also a consideration\u2014maybe the author should have discussed it earlier to avoid this conflict.\n\nBut the key is whether the author is actually in the wrong. If the author has the right to set the guest list, then they aren't in the wrong. However, if rescinding it last minute and causing a rift is considered wrong, maybe they are. The boyfriend's behavior is an issue, so the author's concern isn't unfounded. The answer might lean towards B (they are not in the wrong) because the author is managing their own event's atmosphere as intended.\n"
