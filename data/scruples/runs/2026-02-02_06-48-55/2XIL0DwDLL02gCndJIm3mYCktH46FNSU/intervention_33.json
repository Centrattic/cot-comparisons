I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. The author gave the sister a plus one before because they liked the ex, but after the new boyfriend came in, they don't like him and want to remove his invitation. The sister is threatening not to come if he isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is a big event, and the author designed it to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister's boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author tried to get a cousin to take his place to avoid extra costs. The sister is upset and says she won't come without him.\n\nNow, thinking about typical wedding etiquette. Usually, guests are allowed to bring a plus one, but sometimes there are restrictions. The author initially gave the plus one, so there's a prior agreement. The problem arises when the person the plus one is assigned to (the sister) objects. If the sister is threatening not to attend, that complicates things because family is usually expected to be there.\n\nIs the author's action fair? They might feel that the wedding should be enjoyable for everyone, so they don't want someone they don't like there. However, the sister is an immediate family member, and the author might be overstepping by removing her plus one. Also, the sister's boyfriend is her partner, so it's her choice who to bring. The author might be causing tension with a family member, which could be worse than the presence of the boyfriend.\n\nBut the author is also within their rights to set the tone for their own wedding. If the boyfriend is making others uncomfortable, maybe it's reasonable. However, the author should have discussed this with the sister earlier instead of rescinding last minute. The sister's threat to not come is a significant consequence. The author might not have considered the impact on family relationships.\n\nIn many AITA situations, family conflicts often result in a middle ground where both sides have some fault. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their concerns to the sister before making a decision, leading to a last-minute conflict. Also, taking away a plus one could be seen as controlling, especially if the sister is with her partner. However, the author's reasoning about maintaining an intimate setting could be valid. But the sister's presence at the wedding is more critical than the boyfriend's, so the threat of her not coming might force the author to reconsider.\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't address the issue with the sister earlier and made a unilateral decision. The sister's relationship with her partner is her choice, and the author's interference could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. It's a tough call. Some might say the author has the right to set the guest list, but others might say they shouldn't remove someone's plus one without discussing it. Considering the sister's threat, the author might have to give the plus one back to avoid losing her as a guest. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
