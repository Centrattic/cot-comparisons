I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a guy getting married and he's rescinding his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not invited.\n\nFirst, the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister originally had a plus one when she was with her ex, but now the new boyfriend is causing issues. The guy doesn't want the boyfriend there because he's unemployed, talks too much, and mooches. They found a cousin to take the spot so no money is lost. The sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend isn't there.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and inviting guests is typically the couple's choice. The sister was given a plus one initially, but that was with her ex. Now with a new boyfriend, if the family doesn't like him, the couple has the right to decide who attends. The fact that they waited until last minute and even found a replacement to avoid financial loss shows they tried to be considerate. However, the sister is now threatening to not come, which complicates things. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over his sister's feelings, but he's within his rights as the wedding planner. The boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern for an intimate event. The sister should have known that her plus one is subject to the couple's approval. The age of the boyfriend (31 being unemployed) isn't necessarily a problem, but the behavior issues are. The main issue is the sister's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a choice for his own wedding. Answer B.\n"
