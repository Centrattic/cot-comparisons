I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The author and their sister had a disagreement, and now the sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The wedding is the author's, so they have the right to decide who attends, especially since it's an intimate event. But the sister is being excluded from the wedding itself if she doesn't bring the boyfriend, which complicates things. The girlfriend feels that the boyfriend should be allowed, even though the author and family don't like him. The boyfriend has issues like unemployment, mooching, and being loud. \n\nThe author tried to mitigate the financial loss by getting a cousin as a replacement, so that's a nice touch. But the sister is now threatening to skip the wedding. The problem here is that the author is trying to maintain the intimacy of the event, but excluding the sister might end up causing her absence, which could be hurtful. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the wedding is their event, so they have the authority to set the guest list. However, removing someone's plus one can be a sensitive issue, especially with family. The sister might feel that her relationship choices are being judged, which can be a big deal. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's feelings, which could be seen as selfish. But on the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author wants a pleasant experience for everyone. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author is justified in excluding someone who could spoil the event. But taking away a plus one this close to the wedding and risking the sister's presence is a tough call. Maybe there could have been a better way to address the situation earlier, like talking to the sister and finding a compromise. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to their guest list. However, the way they handled it might be where the issue is. The sister feeling ostracized because of her boyfriend's exclusion is a valid concern. If the author values their sister's presence more, maybe they should reconsider. But if the boyfriend is genuinely making the event unpleasant, it's a different story. \n\nOverall, it's a tricky situation. The answer might hinge on whether the author's decision is about the guest's behavior or personal dislike. The author's reasoning seems to be about the guest's impact on the event, which could support their stance. However, the consequences on the sister's attendance make it more complex. \n\nI think the answer could be a mix, but the user wants a clear A or B. Since the author's main reasoning is about the event's atmosphere and they tried to make a replacement, they might not be in the wrong. But the sister's reaction shows the impact of the decision. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong for making that choice. So, probably answer B.\n"
