I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who rescinded their sister's plus one is in the wrong. The situation involves a destination wedding where the sister's new boyfriend is disliked by the family. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Wedding Guest List Control**: Typically, the couple hosting the wedding has the final say on the guest list. It's their event, and they get to decide who attends. The author might feel that including someone they don't like, especially in an intimate setting, disrupts their plans.\n\n2. **Timing of the Decision**: The rescinding is last-minute, which could be stressful for the sister. However, the author mentions that they found a replacement (the cousin) to avoid financial loss. That shows they tried to mitigate the problem.\n\n3. **Sister's Reaction**: The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't included. This is a significant consequence. The author's action affects the sister's decision to attend, which is personal and emotional for the sister. The sister might feel that her partner's presence is important to her, especially after only six months, which might be a sensitive period.\n\n4. **Reasons for Rescinding**: The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. These are valid concerns for the author, but they are subjective. Others might argue that the sister should handle her own relationship dynamics.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it fair to exclude someone based on personal dislike? The author isn't the boyfriend, so maybe they should focus on their sister's relationship. But it's a destination wedding, which is expensive and personal. The couple might feel they have the right to set the tone.\n\n6. **Communication and Compromise**: Did the author discuss this with the sister before making the decision? If not, that could be a point against them. The sister's threat to not come is serious; maybe there's a middle ground. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the best solution.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's right to control the guest list is on their side. However, the timing and the sister's reaction complicate things. But legally and traditionally, the couple does have the authority. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the sister is close and the exclusion is causing her to not attend, some might argue the author is being harsh. But the user is asking about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The key factors are the control over the event and the sister's autonomy in relationships. The author's decision is within their rights, so B is likely correct.\n"
