I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe person is a 27-year-old male getting married in April. They have a sister, 24F, who was given a plus one. Originally, the plus one was for her ex-boyfriend, but after they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now she's with a new guy who's 31, unemployed, and described as someone who talks a lot and doesn't let others speak. The author can't stand this new boyfriend and has rescinded the plus one, even arranging for a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to attend the wedding if her boyfriend isn't there, and they've only been dating six months.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on guest lists. The author is within their rights to decide who attends their wedding. However, the sister is close in age and part of the immediate family, so cutting off her plus one might affect their relationship.\n\nThe sister's reaction is a big factor. She's threatening not to come, which complicates things. The author might be prioritizing their comfort at the wedding over their sister's feelings. But is it fair to exclude someone just because they're not liked, especially if the sister is upset?\n\nThe boyfriend's traits are mentioned as unemployed, mooching off the sister, and being a poor conversationalist. While those are valid concerns, the author's intolerance might be personal. The sister's boyfriend hasn't necessarily done anything harmful, just traits the author finds annoying. It's possible the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the sister.\n\nAlso, the timing is an issue. The wedding is in April, and this decision is made last minute. The sister might feel this is unfair, especially since they had to replace the plus one with a cousin. The author tried to mitigate financial loss but didn't consider the emotional impact on their sister.\n\nAnother angle: the sister is defending her partner's right to attend because they've only been dating six months. It could be a test of commitment or that the sister wants to show her support for the new relationship. The author's decision might be seen as abrupt and hurtful, especially if the sister feels her partner is not the problem but just her choice of companion.\n\nHowever, the author has a right to their wedding experience. If they genuinely feel the boyfriend would ruin the event, they might have a valid reason. But is it worth losing a sibling over? The sister's potential absence could be a bigger loss than just having someone they dislike there.\n\nI need to weigh the rights and responsibilities here. The author's right to their guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her plus one. The sister's boyfriend is not part of the core family, so the author's decision to exclude him might be justified. But the sister's threat to leave complicates it. The author should have communicated this decision earlier, perhaps, and maybe found a compromise.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person in question acted unreasonably. If the author made a decision that causes family conflict, especially with a close sibling, they might be at fault. However, if the author is prioritizing their own comfort in a personal event, they might not be in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is a red flag, but that doesn't necessarily give the author the right to exclude him without considering the sister's perspective.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because they made a last-minute decision that could alienate a close family member without sufficient communication or compromise. The sister's reaction, while strong, might be a result of feeling disrespected. The author could have addressed the concerns earlier or found a middle ground, like setting boundaries with the boyfriend rather than excluding him entirely.\n"
