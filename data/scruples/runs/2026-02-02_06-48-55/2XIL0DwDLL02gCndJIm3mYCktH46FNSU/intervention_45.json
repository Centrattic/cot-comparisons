I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old guy, is getting married and had given his sister a plus one. The sister's new boyfriend, however, is causing issues. The author and his immediate family don't like him because he's unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. So the author decided to rescind the plus one, but the sister is now threatening to not come to the wedding unless the boyfriend is included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main argument is about wanting an intimate wedding with only close family and friends. The sister's boyfriend is part of her life, but he's only been in the relationship for six months. The author might feel that having someone who's not a close friend or family member at such an important event could be a problem, especially if they don't get along. But on the other hand, the sister is feeling that her partner should be included because she's bringing him along.\n\nThe key points to consider: Is it the author's right to decide who's invited to the wedding? Typically, a wedding is a shared event between the couple, so the author and his partner should have some say over the guest list. However, the sister is part of the family, and excluding her partner might affect her willingness to attend. The sister's reaction is a big factor here. If she's threatening to skip the wedding entirely because her partner isn't allowed, that's a significant consequence. \n\nIs the boyfriend's behavior really a problem? The author mentions that the boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. These are subjective judgments. The author and his family might not like the boyfriend for personal reasons, but that doesn't necessarily mean the boyfriend is problematic. Maybe the author is projecting his own discomfort onto the situation.\n\nAlso, the timeframe is a factor. The wedding is in early April, and the decision to rescind the plus one is last minute. The author managed to get a cousin to fill in, which helps with costs, but the sister is now upset. The author might be prioritizing the guest list over the sister's attendance, which could lead to a rift in the family.\n\nAnother angle: the sister has been in this relationship for six months. Shouldn't the author be more accepting, even if he doesn't like the boyfriend? Maybe the author is overreacting because the boyfriend is new, and the sister values his presence. The author's decision could be seen as being selfish, prioritizing his own comfort over his sister's attendance at his wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is about maintaining an intimate setting with people he truly enjoys. If the boyfriend's presence would make the event uncomfortable for him and his close family, maybe the author is justified in his decision. But does that outweigh the importance of the sister attending?\n\nIt's a tough call. The author might be in the wrong because the sister is a close family member, and excluding her partner could lead to her not attending at all, which would be a bigger issue. However, the author has the right to set boundaries for his wedding. The balance between family dynamics and personal preferences is tricky here. The author's decision might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister is upset. But if the boyfriend is genuinely problematic, then the author is making a hard decision to protect his event's atmosphere.\n"
