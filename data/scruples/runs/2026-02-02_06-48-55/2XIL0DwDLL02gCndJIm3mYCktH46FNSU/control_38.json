I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is getting married and had given their sister a plus one. The sister's new boyfriend is causing issues\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one and found a cousin to replace him. The sister is now threatening not to attend the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author argues it's an intimate event with close friends and family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for cutting the boyfriend from the guest list. \n\nI need to consider a few angles. Weddings are personal, and the host usually has final say over the guest list. The sister was given a plus one initially, but that's conditional. If the new boyfriend is problematic, the author might feel it's necessary to remove him. However, the sister's reaction is strong\u2014threatening to leave. That complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in many cases, the wedding host does have the authority to decide who's invited. The plus one was given as a courtesy, and if the guest is causing issues, removing them isn't inherently wrong. Especially since the author tried to find a replacement to avoid financial loss. \n\nOn the flip side, the sister might feel her autonomy is being disrespected. She's choosing to bring someone, and the author is imposing their dislike. But the author's main reason is to ensure the event is enjoyable for everyone. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author has the right to control the guest list. 2) The boyfriend's behavior could disrupt the event. 3) The sister's threat is a possible consequence, but the author isn't at fault for standing by their decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
