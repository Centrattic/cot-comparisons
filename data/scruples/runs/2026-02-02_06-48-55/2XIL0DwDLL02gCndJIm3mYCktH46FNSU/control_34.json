I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they dislike the new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wedding is intimate with close friends and family. The sister had a plus one initially given to her previous partner, who was liked. After a breakup, the sister got a new boyfriend that the author and their immediate family don't like\u2014unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take the spot to avoid losing money. The sister now threatens not to attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's main argument is about keeping the wedding intimate and only inviting people they can enjoy. The sister feels the boyfriend is her plus one and is important to her attendance. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, weddings are personal events, and the host has the right to set the guest list. However, the sister's plus one was rescinded after she started dating someone new, which might have been unexpected for her. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if it's causing a rift with the sister. But the sister's threat to not attend if the boyfriend isn't invited complicates things. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over family unity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a practical move to avoid financial loss by replacing the plus one with a cousin. The boyfriend's traits are problematic, and the author has a right to enjoy their own event. The sister's threat could be an emotional manipulation tactic. \n\nBalancing both sides: The author isn't inherently in the wrong for wanting to keep their wedding intimate, but rescinding the plus one so close to the event and causing potential family conflict might be seen as harsh. However, the sister's response of threatening not to attend is also problematic. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation. The main reason is that the wedding is the author's to plan as they see fit, and the sister's threat is a reaction to the situation. However, there's a possible middle ground, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author acted to maintain their desired wedding atmosphere, which is reasonable, I would go with B.\n"
