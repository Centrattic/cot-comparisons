I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 27-year-old man getting married, rescinded his sister's plus one for the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author originally gave his sister a plus one when she was with her ex, which is understandable. Then, when she started dating someone new, he didn't like the new boyfriend and decided to take back the plus one. The main points are the author's right to set the guest list and the sister's reaction.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say on the guest list. The author's reasoning is that it's an intimate setting with close friends and family, and he wants to enjoy everyone there. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a red flag, but that's subjective. However, the sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening to not attend if her boyfriend can't come. \n\nThe key issue is whether rescinding a plus one so close to the wedding is fair. The author did manage to replace the guest, so there's no financial loss. But it's last-minute, which might strain the sister's plans. The sister being in a 6-month relationship might feel that her new partner is important to her, and excluding him could feel like a judgment on their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to choose who attends his wedding, especially if the guest is a concern. But maybe the author should have communicated this earlier. The sister's potential absence could also disrupt the wedding, as siblings are often important in ceremonies. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he made a commitment to let the sister bring someone based on her previous relationship, changing it now might not be fair. However, if the new boyfriend is problematic, it's his right to exclude. The conflict here is between the author's preference for a certain guest list and the sister's feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who is being unreasonable. The author made a decision that affects his sister's attendance, which is significant. Maybe he should have set boundaries earlier or discussed the concerns with his sister before rescinding. The sister's reaction, while strong, is a consequence of the author's decision. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might have a valid reason but perhaps handled it poorly. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the last-minute change and the potential for damaging family relations. However, others might side with the author on his right to the guest list. But given the sister's possible exclusion, the author's action might be seen as harsh. So, probably answer A (he is in the wrong) because the decision affects family dynamics and was made late, even if his reasons are understandable.\n"
