I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister being rescinded her plus one for a wedding because the writer doesn't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The writer gave his sister a plus one when her ex-boyfriend was still in the picture. After they broke up, the sister brought a new guy that the family doesn't like. The new boyfriend is unemployed, 31, and seems to be a mooch. The writer decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend can't go. They've been dating 6 months.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what factors should I consider here? Weddings are personal events, and usually, the couple has control over the guest list. The sister's plus one was given under the condition that it was her previous partner, and now that there's a new partner, the writer is within their rights to adjust. The sister's reaction might be emotional, but the writer's main concern is keeping the wedding intimate with close friends and family. \n\nThe boyfriend's traits mentioned (unemployed, mooching, talkative) are subjective. The writer's dislike is based on personal experience. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The writer tried to accommodate by swapping the plus one to a cousin, so there's no financial loss. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the writer's decision is about maintaining a comfortable event. However, rescinding a plus one close to the event might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister had planned to bring him. But since the original plus one was given with the understanding of the ex, the writer might not be obligated to extend it to a new partner. \n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister might feel disrespected, but the writer's main point is about the wedding being intimate. The writer isn't excluding the sister herself, just the plus one. \n\nPossible arguments against the writer: Last-minute changes can be stressful, and the sister might have made plans with her boyfriend. Also, the writer's dislike might be projecting personal biases. \n\nBut the writer took steps to mitigate the issue by replacing the plus one, so financials aren't a problem. If the wedding is supposed to be close friends and family, the boyfriend isn't a family member, so the writer's decision aligns with the event's intent. \n\nIn many cases, people do adjust guest lists as relationships change. The sister's boyfriend wasn't part of the original planning, so it's reasonable to reassess. The sister's threat to not attend is her choice, but the writer isn't in the wrong for enforcing their guest list preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The writer made a decision to maintain the event's integrity, made adjustments to avoid financial loss, and isn't excluding the sister herself. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the decision itself is within the writer's rights.\n"
