I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding. The situation is that the sister's new boyfriend is not well-liked by the author's immediate family. The author is getting married in the Caribbean, had given the sister a plus one before, but now wants to rescind it because the boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The sister is threatening not to attend if the boyfriend can't come, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host (the author) has the right to choose who attends, especially if it's an intimate gathering. The sister was given a plus one initially, but that was when she was with a different partner. Now that she's with someone else, the author is questioning if they made a mistake. The key points are the author's right to set boundaries and the sister's reaction.\n\nThe author managed to find another plus one for the sister, so there's no financial loss, which is commendable. However, the sister is now threatening to not attend, which complicates things. The author's concern is about maintaining a comfortable environment for everyone involved. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her partner is part of her life and should be included.\n\nLegally and traditionally, the person hosting the wedding usually has the final say in guest list matters. However, the sister's decision not to attend if the boyfriend is excluded could cause a rift in the family. The author might be making a personal choice to avoid discomfort, but it could also lead to family tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're asserting their right to have a guest list that makes them comfortable. However, the sister's threat to not attend could be seen as a consequence they didn't anticipate. It's possible that the author didn't consider the sister's feelings enough, but the sister's new boyfriend's behavior is a valid concern for the author.\n\nBalancing both sides, the author's actions might be justified for their own event, but they need to handle the sister's feelings carefully. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation. The sister's reaction is also a factor, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for making a decision to protect their own experience.\n"
