I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author gave their sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who the new partner would be. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and very talkative. The author decided not to let him attend, even though it's last-minute, and managed to get a cousin to cover the cost. The sister is threatening to not attend if the boyfriend can't come.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's plus one was conditional on her partner, the author's dislike of the boyfriend, the last-minute change, and the sister's reaction. \n\nNow, thinking about responsibilities and expectations. Weddings are big events, and usually, guests are expected to be civil around each other. The author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they can't stand there. But taking away a plus one, especially last minute, can be hurtful. \n\nThe sister's argument is that she's been dating this person for 6 months and feels he should come. The author's reasoning is about wanting to enjoy the event with people they like. Is it fair to prioritize personal comfort over a family member's relationship? \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries for their own wedding. They might feel the boyfriend doesn't fit the vibe they want. On the other hand, rescinding a plus one after the person has been in the relationship for a while and after making plans could be seen as unfair. The sister might feel her autonomy is being dismissed, choosing who to bring with her.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author managed to get a cousin instead suggests that it's possible to adjust the plus one, but changing it last-minute might cause logistical issues. The sister's threat to not attend is a serious consequence the author might have to face. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is prioritizing their own preferences, but perhaps not considering the sister's attachment to her partner. The boyfriend's behavior is an issue, but is that enough to exclude him? Maybe the author should have addressed the problem in a different way, like setting boundaries during the event rather than excluding him entirely.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they are making a decision that affects their sister's attendance, which is more significant than the presence of the boyfriend. However, if the author genuinely can't tolerate the boyfriend, maybe they have a point. But the sister's reaction is also valid because she's choosing her partner, and the author's action feels like an overreach. It's a tough call, but I think the author's decision to rescind the plus one without a good compromise might make them the one at fault.\n"
