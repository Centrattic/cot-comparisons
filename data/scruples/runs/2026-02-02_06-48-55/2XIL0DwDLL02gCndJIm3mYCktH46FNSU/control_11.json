I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding. The key points here are the reasons given for the decision and the sister's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author originally gave their sister a plus one when she had a previous boyfriend, who they enjoyed. After the breakup, they waited to see who the sister would bring. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed at 31, mooching off the sister, and very talkative to the point of being overwhelming. The author doesn't want someone they don't get along with at their intimate wedding, which is a destination event. They managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to not attend if the boyfriend isn't included, despite the six-month relationship.\n\nNow, considering etiquette and family dynamics. Weddings are personal, and the host has the right to set the guest list. The sister's boyfriend is not family, and the author's discomfort with his presence is valid, especially in an intimate setting. The sister's reaction seems extreme; choosing not to attend because her partner isn't invited might be seen as putting pressure on the author. However, the author should have communicated their discomfort earlier, perhaps before finalizing the guest list. The fact that they managed a replacement shows they handled the cancellation responsibly, avoiding financial loss. \n\nBut there's a nuance here: rescinding an invitation that was given can be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel that the author is being unfair, especially if the boyfriend's presence wasn't known until late. However, the author's main concern is their comfort during the event. The duration of the relationship (six months) doesn't necessarily justify the plus one, especially if the guest list is meant to be close friends and family. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a gray area. The author has the right to their guest list preferences, but the timing and method of rescinding might have been handled better. The sister's threat adds another layer, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they don't want there. Overall, while the sister's reaction is harsh, the author's decision is about their own comfort and the nature of their event. So, the answer probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
