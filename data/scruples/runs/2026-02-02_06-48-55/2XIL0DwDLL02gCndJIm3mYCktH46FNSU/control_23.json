I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who rescinded their sister's plus one is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider both sides. The author is getting married and wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. They gave their sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now, the sister has a new boyfriend who the family doesn't like because he's unemployed, talks too much, and seems to mooch off her. The author decides to rescind the plus one, replacing it with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nHmm, weddings are personal events, so the author has the right to decide the guest list. However, the sister is an invited guest, and rescinding her plus one at the last minute could strain their relationship. The sister's threat to not attend is a big deal because marriage is a family event, and excluding someone might cause more harm than good. The key points are the author's desire for a close-knit wedding and the sister's reaction. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern, but the author's decision to remove the plus one might be seen as prioritizing personal preferences over family dynamics. But the author also had a valid reason for their initial plus one. It's a balance between personal choice and family relationships. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set the guest list, but they should consider the sister's feelings. However, the sister's threat complicates things. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the closeness of the family. In many cases, the host decides the guest list, so the author isn't wrong. But if the sister's absence would be a significant loss, maybe the author should reconsider. But since the sister is threatening to leave over the plus one, that's her choice. The author's main point is about the intimate setting, so they are within their rights. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
