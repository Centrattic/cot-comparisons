I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical etiquette around weddings. Usually, the wedding couple has some say in who attends, especially for a destination wedding which is more expensive. The author mentions that it's an intimate setting with only close friends and family. The sister's boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and very talkative, which the family doesn't enjoy. \n\nThe author tried to find a replacement (their cousin) to avoid financial loss, so they didn't want to waste money on a guest they don't want. The sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nNow, thinking about the possible angles: On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and they have the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, excluding someone close to a family member can cause a rift. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. \n\nBut the boyfriend is only a plus one, not a family member. The author's main concern is maintaining their desired guest list and comfort. However, the sister might feel that the decision is unfair since they've only been dating six months. There's a balance between personal feelings and family relationships here. \n\nI think the key points are the right to set the guest list and the potential fallout with the sister. If the author's reasoning is valid (uncomfortable with the boyfriend), but the sister's reaction is extreme, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, maybe they should have handled it differently, like discussing it with the sister first instead of rescinding last minute. \n\nWait, the sister's plus one was given because they liked the previous boyfriend. Now the new one is problematic. The author's responsibility is to their own event. But excluding someone can strain family ties. However, the user's own judgment is that the author is in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I need to decide between A and B. If I think the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about wanting to enjoy the event with close people. The boyfriend isn't family, so the author's choice might be justified. However, the sister's reaction is a big issue. But perhaps the author should have communicated better. However, the decision is about their own event. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it's their wedding, but maybe with some nuances. However, the sister is family, so the author might need to consider the relationship. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, not about the sister's reaction. \n\nIn traditional AITA scenarios, the host of the event often has the right to make such decisions, even if it causes family tension. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if the sister's exclusion is too harsh, then maybe A. But the sister is still attending; just the boyfriend isn't. \n\nSo answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
