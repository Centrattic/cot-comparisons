I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend. The sister's boyfriend has some issues: unemployed, seems to mooch, and is really loud in conversations. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because they want it to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister is threatening to not come if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has control over the guest list. The original plus one was for the sister's ex, but now it's a new boyfriend. The author might feel that the new guy doesn't fit the vibe they want. However, the sister is upset because she's been with this guy for six months and wants to bring him. \n\nI should think about the reasons the author gave. The boyfriend is unemployed at 31, which might be a sensitive issue. People have different career paths, and being unemployed doesn't necessarily make someone a bad person. The author mentions he \"mooches\" off the sister and talks too much. These are personal opinions and might not be fair judgments. The sister feels that since they've been dating six months, it's reasonable to include him.\n\nIs the author justified in their decision? On one hand, the wedding is their event, and they can choose who to invite. On the other hand, excluding someone could cause family tension. The sister is threatening to not attend, which complicates things. The author tried to mitigate costs by having their cousin fill in, which is a good move, but the emotional impact is still there.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to control the guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. The author might be prioritizing their comfort and the event's atmosphere, but they could be overreacting based on personal dislikes. The sister's reaction is also extreme, but it's her right to feel that she should bring her partner.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the authority to decide the guest list. However, their judgment of the boyfriend's unemployment and behavior could be seen as hasty or biased. Still, the main issue is the right to exclude someone from a personal event. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
