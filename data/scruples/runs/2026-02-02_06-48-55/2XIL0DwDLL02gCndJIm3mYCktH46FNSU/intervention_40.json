I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author's main points are that the boyfriend is unemployed, mooches off the sister, talks too much, and the wedding is meant to be intimate with close friends and family.\n\nFirst, weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. The author initially gave the plus one with the expectation that the guest would be someone they were okay with. When the boyfriend came along, the author found his behavior and lifestyle unacceptable. The author tried to mitigate the situation by finding a replacement (the cousin) to avoid financial loss, which shows consideration for the sister's feelings.\n\nHowever, the sister is now threatening to not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. This creates a conflict between family members. The key issue here is whether the author overstepped by removing the plus one. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and they have the right to choose their guests. On the other hand, the sister is a family member whose attendance is also important. The author might be right in wanting to keep the guest list small and the atmosphere pleasant, but they might also be being insensitive to their sister's feelings, especially if the boyfriend is a recent partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's traits\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative\u2014could be valid concerns for the author, especially in a small, intimate setting. However, the decision to rescind the plus one last minute might have been abrupt. If the author had addressed the issue earlier, maybe there could have been a compromise. The sister's reaction is also a factor; if she's willing to skip the wedding in protest, it's a serious consequence.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is within their rights to decide the guest list. However, the way the decision was made and the potential impact on the sister's relationship could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should have handled it more sensitively. The final answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the wedding is the author's to manage, and they have the authority over who attends. The sister's threat is her choice, but the author's decision is based on their own comfort and the event's integrity.\n"
