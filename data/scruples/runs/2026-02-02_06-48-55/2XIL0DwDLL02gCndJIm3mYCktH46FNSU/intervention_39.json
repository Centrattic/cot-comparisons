I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (27M) rescinded his sister's (24F) plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical expectations around wedding guest lists. Usually, the couple decides who to invite, right? But there's also a balance when it comes to close family members. The sister was given a plus one before, so maybe there was an understanding that she could bring someone. The issue here is that the new boyfriend is causing tension among the immediate family.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants the wedding to be intimate and only include people he actually likes. The boyfriend is unemployed, talks too much, and others don't like him. But the sister is upset and threatens to not come if her boyfriend isn't invited. That's a tough spot. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to decide who attends his wedding. On the other hand, the sister's plus one was initially given, and rescinding it so close to the event might be seen as unfair or hurtful. The sister's threat adds pressure, which complicates things. The author tried to mitigate the issue by replacing the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he overstepped by removing the plus one without considering the impact on his sister. Weddings can be emotional, and excluding someone important to a close family member might cause rifts. Even though the author wants an intimate setting, the sister is part of the immediate family, so her presence is significant. \n\nHowever, the author's main concern is about the boyfriend's behavior and the desire for a pleasant experience. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative, mooching) are valid concerns. But the sister's boyfriend isn't part of the immediate family, so maybe the author is justified in not wanting someone who could be uncomfortable for guests. \n\nThe key points are: the plus one was rescinded last minute, the sister is close, the author tried to find a replacement, and the sister is threatening to leave. The moral dilemma is between the author's comfort and the sister's feelings. \n\nIn AITA posts, often the person who causes a family conflict without considering the other's feelings is in the wrong. However, the author might be seen as standing up for his wedding preferences. But since it's a close family member, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the decision affected a close relative and the handling was abrupt. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because it's their wedding. Need to weigh both perspectives.\n"
