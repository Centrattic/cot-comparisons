I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a guy rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, the user is the brother, 27, getting married. They had given the sister a plus one originally when she was with a previous boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited until a new guy came along. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The brother doesn't want him at the wedding because he doesn't like him. They found a cousin to take his place to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not attend if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the brother in the wrong for rescinding the plus one?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother's perspective is that he wants a small, intimate wedding with people he likes. The sister's side is that she's bringing a new partner, and if he's not allowed, she won't come. The brother might argue that he should be able to set the guest list for his own wedding. On the other hand, excluding a sibling's partner might be seen as harsh, especially if they've only been dating six months.\n\nBut the sister isn't being excluded; her plus one is. The brother is allowing his cousin to attend instead. However, the sister is using the threat of not attending, which could be a problem. It depends on how important the sister is to the wedding. If the brother values having his sister at the wedding, he might need to reconsider. But if he truly can't tolerate the boyfriend and the wedding is meant to be for close friends and family, then his decision might be justified.\n\nAnother angle: The sister was given a plus one before, but the brother isn't obligated to allow someone he doesn't like. However, the timing is last minute, and the sister might feel it's unfair to change the guest list now. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a personal issue, but that's between the sister and her boyfriend. The brother's dislike might be personal, but he's the one hosting the event.\n\nPossible arguments for the brother not being in the wrong: He's in charge of his wedding guest list. He's making adjustments to keep the event intimate. He replaced the plus one with a cousin, so no financial loss. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern for the atmosphere of the wedding.\n\nArguments against him: The sister's relationship with her partner is personal. The brother is making a unilateral decision that affects the sister. The sister's threat to not attend could mean the brother loses her presence at his wedding. The duration of the relationship (six months) might not be long enough for the brother to have a strong opinion on the boyfriend's character.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's right to set the guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. The brother is not forcing the sister to not attend, just her partner. If the sister chooses to come without her boyfriend, then the brother's decision stands. However, if the sister is using emotional manipulation (threatening not to come), that's her choice, not the brother's fault. The brother might not be in the wrong because he's managing his own event. But some might argue that he's being overly controlling or that the sister's partner's presence isn't the brother's concern unless there's specific behavior issues. However, the brother has valid reasons for not wanting someone there. So maybe the answer is B (the brother is not in the wrong).\n"
