I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding. The author is 27M, and the sister is 24F. The sister's new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author wants to exclude him because they don't like him, and they've replaced him with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded. The author wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the author's right to decide whom to invite to their wedding versus the sister's right to bring a partner. Weddings are personal events, and the host typically has control over the guest list. However, family dynamics can complicate this. The sister's reaction is significant here\u2014threatening to not attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. That's a strong move and might indicate that the sister feels her autonomy is being infracted upon.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend has negative traits (unemployed, mooches, talkative), which could disrupt the intimate setting. But the sister has only been dating him for six months. Is it fair to exclude someone based on personality traits that others dislike? Also, the author's previous acceptance of the sister's ex-boyfriend might imply some expectation that the sister could bring a partner if she had one.\n\nHowever, the author did give the sister a plus one initially, which was later rescinded. The sister's new partner was brought into the mix after the original decision. The author might feel that the guest list should reflect people they can get along with. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her partner's presence is important for her to attend, especially if she's bringing someone new. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author managed to replace the plus one to avoid losing money, which shows consideration for expenses. But the sister's potential absence could have bigger emotional and familial consequences. The author might be causing a rift in the family over a guest list decision, which is a common AITA scenario. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for wedding guests to be close friends and family. The author's goal is to have an intimate event. However, excluding a partner could be seen as overly controlling, especially if the sister is bringing him as a plus one. The duration of the relationship (six months) might not be long enough for others to form a strong opinion, but the author's dislike is based on observed behavior. \n\nThe sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The author needs to consider how important the sister's presence is versus the potential discomfort of having the boyfriend there. The author might be in the right to set boundaries for their own event but could be overstepping by causing a family conflict. Alternatively, the sister should perhaps prioritize the wedding over her new partner, given the short relationship duration. \n\nIn some cases, families have had to make similar decisions, and the wedding planner often advises that the couple's preferences take precedence. However, this can lead to hurt feelings and family tension. The author's approach is to exclude someone the sister is close to, which can be seen as harsh. The sister's reaction is also extreme but might stem from feeling that her relationship is being disrespected. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author has the right to their guest list, but excluding a family member's partner can be sensitive. The sister's potential absence is a big issue. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the family typically handles such matters. The author's reasoning is valid regarding the intimate setting, but the sister's reaction is also a valid concern. The author might be in the wrong if the exclusion is based on personal dislike rather than a serious issue. However, if the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely disruptive, the author could be justified. Given the information, the author's decision is within their rights, but the sister's response is also understandable. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the host can set the guest list, but the sister's reaction complicates things. However, the sister's potential exclusion is a major consequence, so maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm, conflicting sides. I think the key is that the author made a decision to maintain comfort at their event, which is their right, so the answer is B. But some might argue A if excluding a partner is seen as overly controlling. I need to decide based on the provided scenario.\n"
