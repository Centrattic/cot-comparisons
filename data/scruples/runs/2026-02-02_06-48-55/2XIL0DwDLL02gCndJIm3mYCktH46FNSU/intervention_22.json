I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother (the author) rescinding his sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The brother gave his sister a plus one initially when she had a previous boyfriend. Now, with a new one, they (the brother and family) don't like the new guy. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last-minute, and found a cousin to cover the cost. The sister is upset and might not come without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points are: Is it fair for the brother to control who his sister brings to his wedding? Weddings are personal, but excluding someone based on dislike could be problematic. The sister's autonomy is a factor here. If the sister feels that the boyfriend is part of her life now, not allowing him might be seen as the brother overstepping. However, the brother wants to keep it intimate and avoid people he doesn't like. But is it his right to exclude someone else's partner?\n\nAlso, the timing is last minute. The sister might feel that the decision is being made too late, adding stress. The argument is that the brother is prioritizing his comfort over his sister's choice, which could damage their relationship. On the other hand, the brother might believe he's protecting the event's atmosphere.\n\nI think the balance here leans towards the author being in the wrong. While weddings are personal, excluding someone's partner without a very good reason can be seen as controlling. The sister has the right to bring someone she's in a relationship with, even if the family doesn't approve. The brother's decision could be perceived as prioritizing his own preferences over his sister's needs, which might lead to the sister not attending at all, which is a bigger issue. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
