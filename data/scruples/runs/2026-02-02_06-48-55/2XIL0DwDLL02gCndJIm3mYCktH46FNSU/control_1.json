I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's boyfriend because they don't like him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is getting married and had given their sister a plus one, initially because they liked her ex. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the author and immediate family don't get along with. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a replacement, and the sister is threatening not to come unless the boyfriend is included. They've been dating six months.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they can't stand there. The sister is upset and might not attend unless her boyfriend is allowed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about wedding etiquette. Generally, the bride and groom have the final say on their guest list. However, siblings, especially plus ones, can complicate things. The author had given the plus one initially, but that was when the sister was with someone else. After a breakup, the author waited to see who she'd bring. Now, with a new partner, they decided to rescind. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host should be comfortable with all guests. If the boyfriend is problematic, it's reasonable to exclude him. However, the sister might feel that her attendance is tied to her partner. But the sister could have chosen not to bring an ex, which she did. Now, the new boyfriend is causing issues, so the author is removing the plus one. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her relationship is her business, and the author is overstepping. However, the author isn't preventing the sister from attending; they're just limiting the plus one. The sister could attend without the boyfriend. But she's threatening not to go if he's excluded. That's a bit of a leverage point. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe, but the author has already made a decision and found a replacement. The sister's reaction is to threaten not to attend. The author might be in the right if they believe the guest list should reflect their comfort. However, it's a sensitive situation because it affects family relationships. \n\nI think the key here is the author's right to have a comfortable guest list. If the boyfriend is a problem, excluding him is their choice. The sister's reaction is a consequence, but the author isn't in the wrong for making that call. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
