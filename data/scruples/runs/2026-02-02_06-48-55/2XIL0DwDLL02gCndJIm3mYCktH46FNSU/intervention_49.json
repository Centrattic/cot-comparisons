I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they dislike the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The original plus one was given when the sister was with the ex-boyfriend, who they liked. After the breakup, the sister found a new partner, and the author and their immediate family don't like him. The author decided to rescind the plus one, replacing it with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is now threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set the guest list versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. Weddings are personal, and the couple typically has the final say on who attends. However, the sister's reaction is significant\u2014threatening not to attend the wedding of a sibling. That could be a major family issue.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and typical expectations. Usually, the wedding couple decides the guest list. But since it's a close family member, there's a balance between personal preference and family relationships. The author's reason for excluding the boyfriend is based on personal dislike, not something like safety or appropriateness. The boyfriend's unemployment and talkative nature are subjective issues.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they have the right to set the guest list. However, the sister's reaction might be seen as understandable if the author didn't communicate properly or if the exclusion feels unfair. The author did replace the plus one with a cousin, which might mitigate some guilt, but the sister still feels excluded.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's threat to not attend is extreme. The author has to weigh the importance of their own event versus family dynamics. But if the sister is a close family member, excluding her partner could cause lasting family issues. However, the original plus one was conditional on the ex-boyfriend, and the new partner isn't liked by the immediate family.\n\nI think the author's decision is within their rights as the wedding organizer, but the way it's handled might lack empathy. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they didn't go overboard and tried to mitigate costs, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The sister's reaction is more about her feelings, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they don't like. So, answer B (No).\n"
