I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who's getting married and decided to rescind his sister's plus one because her new boyfriend is really disliked by the immediate family. Originally, they gave her a plus one when she was with her previous partner, but after the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The new guy is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off his sister, and is very talkative to the point of being overwhelming. The author doesn't want him at the wedding because the event is meant to be intimate with close family and friends. They found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not come if the boyfriend can't attend, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He wants his wedding to be with close family and friends, designed as an intimate setting. He's decided that some guests shouldn't be there because they don't fit that vibe. The sister's boyfriend is a problem because he's not well-liked by the immediate family. The author tried to mitigate the financial impact by having a cousin take the place. The main issue here is about the author's right to decide who is at his wedding versus the sister's right to bring someone she's dating.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's perspective: She's been given a plus one before when she was in a relationship, so she might expect that she can bring someone now. The boyfriend has only been in the relationship for six months, which is a relatively short time, but maybe the sister feels he's important enough to include. Her response is to potentially not attend the wedding if he can't come, which is a significant threat. That could be seen as holding her attendance hostage over the plus one, which might be a bit extreme. However, she's also in a relationship and might feel that her partner should be part of her family's events.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is the one hosting the wedding and is responsible for guest lists and budgets. It's a destination wedding, which is more expensive and logistically complex. The author's intention is to keep it intimate, which is a valid desire. However, rescinding a plus one after the guest list was set could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the sister was expecting to bring someone, even if the boyfriend is problematic.\n\nBut then, the sister's boyfriend is described as someone who's unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The author's family has a legitimate concern about this person's behavior and lifestyle. The author is trying to protect the wedding atmosphere. However, the timing is an issue\u2014rescinding a plus one so close to the wedding might be seen as inconsiderate. The sister had already been given a plus one before, and now she's in a new relationship. It's possible that the author is projecting his family's dislike onto the guest list decision, which might be valid if the boyfriend is truly problematic.\n\nAnother angle: The sister is using her attendance as leverage. If she doesn't attend the wedding, that's a big deal. The author might feel that the sister should attend regardless of the boyfriend. But the sister might feel that her partner is part of her life now and deserves to be included. The six-month relationship is relatively new, but that doesn't necessarily disqualify the boyfriend from attending.\n\nLegally and socially, the guest list is usually up to the couple hosting the wedding. The author is within his rights to make such decisions. However, the way he's handling it\u2014rescinding a plus one and causing a rift with his sister\u2014might be seen as a problem. The sister's threat to not attend is also a significant consequence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to maintain the integrity of his wedding. On the other, it might be seen as unfair to rescind a plus one when the sister is in a new relationship, even if the boyfriend is problematic. The key factors are the timing, the sister's potential absence, and the validity of the concerns about the boyfriend. The author's actions might lead to a family conflict, which is a downside regardless of the initial decision's justification.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reasons are reasonable. Since the boyfriend is described as mooching and overly talkative, the author's concerns are valid. But the sister's reaction is also a problem. The author is trying to protect his wedding, but the way he's doing it might be causing unnecessary harm to the relationship with his sister. There's a balance between being reasonable about the guest list and maintaining family harmony. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for criticism in how the situation is handled, especially if the sister's attendance is a bigger priority than excluding the boyfriend.\n"
