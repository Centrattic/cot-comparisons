I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 27-year-old guy, is getting married and had given his sister a plus one. The sister had a previous boyfriend they liked, but after they broke up, she started dating a new guy that the author's immediate family doesn't like. The author decided to rescind the plus one for the new boyfriend, even though it's last minute. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend can't go. The author argues that the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family, which is why he doesn't want this guy there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one who initially gave the plus one to the sister. The sister then found a new partner, and the author's family is unhappy with him. The author is trying to maintain the intimacy of the event, which is reasonable. However, rescinding the plus one after the sister had already started planning with her partner could cause conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set the guest list for his own wedding. It's a personal event, and he's within his rights to decide who attends. Especially since the wedding is described as intimate, limiting guests to close people is logical. The boyfriend's characteristics\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative\u2014might be valid concerns for the author's comfort and the event's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister could feel that her autonomy is being respected. She's an adult, and her partner is part of her life. The author's decision could be seen as dismissive of her relationship, even if it's only six months old. However, the sister is also an adult who chose to bring this partner, not the author. The problem is that the author gave a plus one with the expectation that the guest would be someone they already knew and liked. When the guest changes, the author is within his rights to adjust, especially since the wedding is their event to control.\n\nBut there's a potential issue with last-minute changes. The author did find a solution by having a cousin take the spot to avoid financial loss, which shows consideration. However, the sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The author might need to weigh the importance of his guest list against the bond with his sister. If the sister is a key attendee, losing her might affect the author's happiness.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's family disapproves of the boyfriend, but the author's family includes his immediate family. If the sister's boyfriend is causing discomfort for the author's family, then it's a valid reason to adjust the guest list. However, the author is making a decision based on his family's feelings, which complicates things. The sister might feel that her personal choice is being overruled by her brother's family's opinions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong to prioritize his own event's atmosphere. However, the way it's handled could be problematic. Communication is key. If the author had discussed this with his sister earlier, maybe there could have been a compromise. But since he changed the plus one last minute without prior discussion, it's causing a rift. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is trying to maintain the intimacy of his wedding, which is his right. However, the sister's reaction might be more about her feeling that her partner's inclusion is important for her to attend. The author's stance is that the wedding should be for close family and friends, but the sister's partner isn't close to them. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because he's making decisions about his own wedding, even if it's causing a conflict with his sister.\n"
