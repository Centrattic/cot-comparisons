I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for the sister's boyfriend at a wedding.\n\nFirst, the author gave the sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. When they broke up, they waited to see who the new boyfriend would be. The sister's new boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him to come, so they rescind the plus one. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't invited. The author got a cousin to fill in to avoid losing money.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want everyone at the wedding to be people they enjoy, keeping it intimate. The sister feels the boyfriend should be there since they've been going out six months. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, weddings can be stressful, and the author might have a right to set boundaries. If the boyfriend is difficult and the event is supposed to be with close friends and family, maybe excluding someone who is a burden makes sense. But on the other hand, the sister is a direct family member. The author is using her plus one, which she might see as part of the package. Rescinding it could be seen as punishing the sister for her relationship choice. Also, six months might not be long enough to form a solid relationship, but it's not that short either. The sister might feel the author is being judgmental about her dating life. The author's actions could lead to the sister not attending, which could hurt family relations. There's also the issue of fairness\u2014does the author have the right to decide who in the sister's life can attend their wedding? Maybe the author should have communicated their concerns earlier instead of rescinding last-minute. The author might be in the wrong because it's a sudden decision, and the sister has a right to bring someone, even if they don't like the choice. Alternatively, if the wedding is supposed to be intimate, the author has some control over the guest list. Also, considering the cousin is filling in, maybe it's a financial issue, but the sister's attendance is at stake. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. But generally, family weddings can have expectations for immediate family to attend with a plus one. The author might be overstepping by removing the plus one based on personal dislike of the boyfriend. The sister's threat to not come is a significant consequence. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but there are arguments both ways. However, the fact that the author made a unilateral decision without considering the sister's feelings might tip it towards A.\n"
