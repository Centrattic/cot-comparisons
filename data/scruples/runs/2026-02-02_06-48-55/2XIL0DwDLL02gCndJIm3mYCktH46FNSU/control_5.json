I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they rescinded their sister's plus one for the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to attend if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is a big event, and usually, people bring plus ones. The original plus one was given because they liked her old boyfriend. Now the sister has a new one, and the author can't stand him. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author wants to exclude him but found a way to fill the spot with a cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and might not come if he's not invited.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, weddings are typically for close friends and family. The author wants everyone there to be someone they enjoy. The new boyfriend's behavior is problematic. But on the other hand, the sister is being excluded because of her partner, which could be seen as unfair. Also, the sister is threatening to not attend, which is a major consequence. Maybe the author should have tried to talk to the sister first instead of rescinding the plus one unilaterally. \n\nBut the author did give the sister a chance to bring someone else after the breakup, and now the new guy is not well-liked. The author's reasoning is that they want the wedding to be intimate with people they enjoy. If the sister is bringing someone that the author can't stand, it might affect the atmosphere. However, excluding someone's partner can be hurtful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like talking to the sister about the concerns instead of cutting off the plus one without discussion. But the author already did that, and the sister might not listen. \n\nThe key points are the right to have an intimate wedding with people you feel comfortable around versus respecting the sister's relationship. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's wishes. But if the boyfriend is truly a problem, maybe the author isn't wrong. It's a bit of a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cases, you can have some say over your wedding guests, especially in a destination wedding where space is limited. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. However, the way it's handled could be improved by communication rather than just rescinding. But according to the scenario, the author did take steps to replace the plus one with a cousin, so they might not be at fault here.\n"
