I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The author's sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author initially gave the sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who the new partner would be. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, a moocher, and very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding and has already arranged for a cousin to take his place to avoid extra costs. The sister is threatening not to attend if he's excluded.\n\nNow, the key points here. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on who attends, especially if it's supposed to be intimate. The author's reasoning is that they want everyone present to be someone they enjoy. However, the sister's reaction is strong\u2014she's considering not attending at all. That's a big deal because family relationships can be affected long-term.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries for their own event. Excluding someone based on personal dislike is their choice. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her autonomy and relationship with the author are being undermined. The fact that the boyfriend is only six months into the relationship could mean it's still new, and the author's family disapproval might affect the couple's dynamic.\n\nBut the author did take steps to mitigate the financial impact, which shows they tried to be considerate. However, the sister's potential absence is a significant consequence. The author needs to weigh the importance of their comfort against their sister's possible exclusion. \n\nI think the author has a valid reason to exclude someone they find unpleasant, especially if the wedding is supposed to be a close-knit gathering. But they might not have considered the emotional impact on their sister. However, the sister's threat to leave the wedding entirely seems extreme. The author isn't the one who's necessarily in the wrong here; they made a decision based on their preferences and adjusted as much as they could. The sister's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected than the exclusion itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They have the right to manage their event as they see fit, even if it causes tension.\n"
