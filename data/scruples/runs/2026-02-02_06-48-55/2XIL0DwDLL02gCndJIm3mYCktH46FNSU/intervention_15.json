I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one for his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come if he's not allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother gave his sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, he decided to wait and see who her new partner would be. The new boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The brother then rescinds the plus one, even though it's last minute, and got a cousin to cover the cost. The sister is upset and says she won't come without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the brother was right to rescind the plus one. On one hand, the wedding is supposed to be intimate with close family and friends. If the sister's boyfriend is a negative influence, maybe it's reasonable. But on the other hand, the sister might feel her autonomy is being taken away. The brother is the one hosting the wedding, so he might have the right to set the guest list. However, excluding someone because of personal dislike could be seen as unfair, especially if the boyfriend hasn't done anything to directly harm the brother.\n\nThe sister being threatening to stay away complicates things. Maybe the brother should have discussed this with her earlier instead of making a last-minute decision. Also, the boyfriend's behavior is a problem for the whole family, so the brother's concern about the wedding atmosphere is valid. But is it right to exclude someone based on their partner's traits? It might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. \n\nSome might argue the brother's right to control the guest list, others might say he's being too controlling. The fact that they got a cousin to cover the cost shows they tried to avoid financial loss, which could be seen as a positive step. But the sister's reaction is also valid\u2014feeling that her partner is being judged or excluded without a fair chance. \n\nIn many cases, weddings are about the couple's preferences, so the brother is not wrong to prioritize his comfort. However, the sister's feelings are also important. Maybe a middle ground was possible, but the situation is polarized. The key is whether the brother acted within his rights to set the guest list. Since he's the one hosting, it's his choice, but the way he handled it (last minute, without discussing) might be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but some might argue he's inconsiderate. However, the main point is his right to decide the guest list. The sister's threat is her own choice, so the brother's action isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
