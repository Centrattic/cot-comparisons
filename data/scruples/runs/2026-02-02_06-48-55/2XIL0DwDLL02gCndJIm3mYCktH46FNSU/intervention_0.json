I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author gave the sister a plus one initially when she was with her ex-boyfriend, whom the family liked. After the breakup, the sister brought a new partner. The author and family don't like this new guy\u2014he's unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a replacement, but the sister is threatening to not attend the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and the host (the author in this case) has the right to decide the guest list. However, the sister is a close family member, and removing her plus one might affect their relationship. The author wants an intimate setting with close family and friends, so they might feel that the boyfriend doesn't fit that. But the sister is pushing back, which is a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author made a decision after the initial arrangement. The sister had a plus one initially, but now it's rescinded. The timing is close to the wedding, which adds stress.\n2. The author found a replacement (the cousin) to cover the cost, so there's no financial loss. That shows consideration, but the emotional impact on the sister is significant.\n3. The sister is threatening not to attend, which is a serious consequence for the author's wedding. The author might lose a family member at the event, which can be hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky situation. On one hand, the author has the right to control the guest list and ensure the event is enjoyable for them. On the other hand, excluding a sibling's partner, even if newly in the relationship, can be seen as dismissive or hurtful. The sister's reaction might be extreme, but the author's action could be perceived as unfair if the boyfriend is part of her support system now.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the decision was made without considering the sister's perspective. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for 6 months, which is half a year. While it's not a long-term partner, it's a significant enough time that the sister might feel he should be included. The author's reasoning is about the guest list being intimate, but it's possible that the sister sees this as a personal slight. \n\nHowever, the author did make an effort to find a replacement, which shows they tried to mitigate the issue. The main conflict is whether the guest list should prioritize the host's comfort or include family members' partners. In many cases, weddings are about the couple, so the host's preferences are valid. But it's a balancing act, especially with family. The sister's threat to not attend is a strong reaction, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a right to their own wedding experience. However, the way the decision was communicated and the sister's reaction might not be the author's fault. The author might be justified in their decision, but the sister's response is also a factor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the sister. \n\nIn similar scenarios, people often argue that the host has the final say. So, in that sense, the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the sister's threat is taken seriously, the author might be causing a rift that wasn't necessary. But the author's reasoning is about enjoying the event with close ones, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to manage their guest list as they see fit, especially for their own wedding. The sister's reaction is her own choice, and the author tried to handle it by replacing the plus one. However, there's a nuance here. If the sister didn't have the plus one initially and later started going with someone, the situation is different. But since the sister had a plus one before, the author might have a point in adjusting it. The main issue is the author's right vs. the sister's expectation. Given that the author is the one hosting and wants an intimate event, they're justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
