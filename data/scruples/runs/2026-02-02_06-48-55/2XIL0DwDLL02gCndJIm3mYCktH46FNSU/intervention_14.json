I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author, a 27-year-old male, is getting married and had given his sister a plus one. The sister's previous boyfriend was liked by the author and his family, but now she's with a new guy who is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author wants him not to attend the wedding, which is supposed to be intimate. They managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are personal events, and the author has a right to control the guest list for their own comfort. The sister's boyfriend's behavior might make the author uncomfortable, especially in an intimate setting. The author also adjusted things to avoid financial loss, which shows they tried to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset because her partner is being excluded. The boyfriend has been with her for six months, which isn't that long, but the author's family is quick to judge him based on his unemployment and behavior. The sister's threat to not attend is significant because it's a family event, and maybe the author didn't consider the emotional impact on her.\n\nPossible angles: The author's right to have an intimate wedding vs. the sister's right to bring her partner. The timing of rescinding the plus one is last minute, which might be unfair. Also, the sister's relationship status was different when the plus one was given, so changing the guest list now might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's justification is about comfort and the event's intimacy. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is considered the asshole if they're being inconsiderate or overstepping, but if they're standing up for their boundaries, they might be in the right. Here, the author is trying to maintain their desired environment for the wedding, which is a personal choice. However, the sister's reaction is also valid because it's affecting her attendance. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author overstepped by excluding someone based on personal dislike, especially since the sister is a family member. Maybe the author should have communicated better or found another solution instead of rescinding the plus one. Alternatively, the author's decision is about their comfort, which is important. \n\nThe key points are: the sister's boyfriend is disliked by the author's family, the author wants an intimate wedding, and the sister is threatened with exclusion if her partner isn't allowed. The answer hinges on whether excluding someone from a family member's event is acceptable. In many cases, people do set boundaries for their weddings, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, the sister's threat to not attend complicates things. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to control their wedding's atmosphere. But some might argue that excluding the sister's partner is harsh. However, since the author adjusted the plus one to avoid financial issues, it shows they tried to be fair. The sister's reaction is her own issue, but the author isn't necessarily the asshole here.\n"
