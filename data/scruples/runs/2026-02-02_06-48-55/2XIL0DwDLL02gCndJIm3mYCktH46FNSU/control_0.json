I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer is rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's not included.\n\nFirst, the writer's reasoning: they want the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister had a previous plus one with her ex, which was okay, but the new boyfriend is problematic. The boyfriend is unemployed, mooches off the sister, and is very talkative, making conversations hard. The writer found a replacement plus one (their cousin) to avoid losing money.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the right to set the guest list. The sister was given a plus one initially, but that was for her previous partner. The new boyfriend's behavior might disrupt the event. The writer is trying to maintain the intimacy they wanted, which is a valid concern. However, the sister is now threatening to not attend, which could be a problem because family is important. But the writer isn't banning the sister; just the plus one. They even found a replacement to avoid financial loss. The sister's boyfriend is only 6 months into the relationship, so maybe it's too early to have him at such an event. The writer isn't being malicious but is setting boundaries for their own comfort. \n\nOn the flip side, the sister might feel that her relationship is being judged. However, the writer isn't judging the relationship itself, just the person's behavior. The boyfriend's unemployment and talkativeness are issues that could affect the wedding atmosphere. The writer has a right to ensure their guests are people they can get along with. Since they made a replacement, they aren't leaving the sister without a plus one, just not allowing the problematic one. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer is acting to protect their own event's atmosphere and isn't being unreasonable. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the writer isn't in the wrong here.\n"
