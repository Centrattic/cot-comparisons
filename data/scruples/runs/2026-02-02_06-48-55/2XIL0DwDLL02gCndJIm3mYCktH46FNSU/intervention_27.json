I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The sister's new boyfriend is causing issues with the family, and the author wants him excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is a big event, and it's the author's right to decide the guest list. But taking away a plus one from a sister, especially last minute, might cause family tensions. The sister is threatening not to come, which adds pressure.\n\nThe author mentions they designed the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family. That's a valid point because they might not want someone they don't get along with there. But the sister's boyfriend has been in the relationship for six months. Is that enough time to adjust guest lists? Maybe the author should have addressed this earlier when the boyfriend was introduced.\n\nAlso, the sister is upset because she feels her partner should be included. Relationships are important, and excluding someone might be seen as personal. The author did offer a cousin as a replacement, which helps with costs, but the sister is still upset. \n\nIs the author overstepping? It's their wedding, so they have control. However, cutting off a family member's plus one without discussion could be insensitive. The author might not be in the wrong technically, but maybe they could have handled it differently. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening not to attend is a strong move. \n\nI think the author's intention is to keep the wedding enjoyable for everyone, but the method might be harsh. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family expectations. Since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, maybe I should consider if the author's actions are justified despite the consequences. Ultimately, it's their wedding, so maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
