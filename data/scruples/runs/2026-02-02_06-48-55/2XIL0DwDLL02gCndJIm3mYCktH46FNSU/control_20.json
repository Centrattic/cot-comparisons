I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. The sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The writer wants to keep the wedding intimate with close friends and family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they want everyone at the wedding to be enjoyable, especially since it's an intimate event. The sister's side is that she's been with the boyfriend for six months and feels he should be included. The author managed to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, which shows they tried a solution.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the host has the right to set the guest list. However, the sister is a guest herself, and her exclusion might be a bigger issue if she doesn't attend. The author might be overstepping by removing the plus one based on personal dislike of the boyfriend, even if the reasons are valid (like the guy being unemployed and talkative). But the key is that the wedding is the author's event, so they have the final say.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is extreme. Threatening not to attend because her partner isn't allowed might be a bigger problem. But the author is using the plus one as leverage, which could strain family relations. However, the author did try to mitigate costs by getting a cousin to take the spot. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're hosting the wedding and have the right to decide who attends. The sister's reaction is more concerning. So the answer is B.\n"
