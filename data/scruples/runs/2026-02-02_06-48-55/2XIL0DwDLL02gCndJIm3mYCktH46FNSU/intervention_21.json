I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old guy getting married in April. His sister, who's 24, was given a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring next. Now she's dating a new guy, and the author and his immediate family don't like him. The guy is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative, not letting others speak. The author decided to rescind the plus one so the new guy can't come, even though it's last minute. He found a cousin to take his place to avoid extra costs. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend can't. The author thinks his wedding should be an intimate event with only close people and wants everyone there to be enjoyable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: the sister was given a plus one when she was with the ex. Now, with a new partner, the author is rescinding it because of his dislike for the new boyfriend. The sister is upset and might not attend if he's excluded.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that it's an intimate event, and he wants everyone there to be enjoyable. That makes sense. Weddings are personal events, and the host might have a right to choose their guests. However, the sister is being excluded from the wedding if she doesn't bring her boyfriend. That seems harsh. The sister's threat is that she won't come if her boyfriend can't. Is it fair for the author to prioritize his own comfort over his sister attending? Maybe the sister could come without the boyfriend, but she's using his exclusion as leverage to attend with him.\n\nBut the author might feel that the new boyfriend is disruptive. The boyfriend's unemployment and mooching might be seen as problematic. The author's family members also don't like him. So, there's a valid concern about the guest's behavior affecting the event. However, the author made the decision without discussing it with his sister, leading to conflict.\n\nThe issue here is about the boundaries between personal choice and family relationships. The author has the right to decide who's at his wedding, but by excluding the boyfriend and causing the sister to potentially miss the wedding, he's causing a rift. Maybe the author should have had a conversation with his sister first, explaining his reasons and finding a compromise. Instead, he took a hard line, leading to the sister's backlash.\n\nAnother angle: the sister might feel that the author is being judgmental about her choice of partner. The boyfriend has only been with her for six months, so maybe the author is being too quick to judge. The sister might feel that her relationship is valid regardless of others' opinions. The author's decision could be seen as overstepping by not allowing her to bring someone she's choosing to be with, even if the family doesn't approve.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responsible for the logistics and budget of the wedding. He might have already accounted for the plus one, and changing it last minute to include a cousin could be a solution. But the sister's threat to not attend is significant. The author might be losing a family member from the event, which is a big deal. However, the author's main concern is the atmosphere at his wedding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between his right to control his wedding and the sister's right to attend with her partner. If the author had communicated his concerns earlier and perhaps set boundaries, maybe the situation could have been resolved differently. But since he made the decision unilaterally, it's causing conflict. The sister is using her attendance as leverage, which is also problematic because the wedding is a family event and she should attend if possible, regardless of the boyfriend's presence.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely wrong in wanting to exclude someone who could be disruptive, but the way he handled it without considering the sister's feelings and relationship could be at fault. The sister's threat is also extreme. The ideal solution might have been to discuss it with her and find a middle ground, but the author's main issue was the exclusion leading to possible non-attendance. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle it with sensitivity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the author is within his rights to choose guests, then B (not wrong). But the sister's threat complicates it. Maybe the author is not wrong, but the sister is overreacting. However, the way the author cut the plus one without discussion might be the problem. I think the answer is A.\n"
