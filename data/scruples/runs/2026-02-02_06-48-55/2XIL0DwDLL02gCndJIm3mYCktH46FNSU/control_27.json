I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a 27-year-old guy getting married and has rescinded his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules around weddings. Typically, weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to choose their guests. The author mentions it's an intimate setting with close friends and family. His sister originally had a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend, but now with a new boyfriend, the family isn't comfortable with him.\n\nThe boyfriend is 31, unemployed, and described as a mooch and a talkative person. The author and family don't enjoy his presence. However, the sister is pushing back, saying she won't attend without her boyfriend. The author managed to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss, so there's no financial burden.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wedding is their event, so they have the right to decide who attends. The sister is an invited guest but isn't entitled to bring someone if the couple doesn't want them there. However, the sister is a family member, so there's a personal relationship aspect. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over family, which could cause tension. But the wedding is their day, and they have the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are the wedding's intimacy, the couple's right to guest list control, and the sister's reaction. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to keep the event personal. The sister's threat to not attend is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to allow someone they don't like. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to manage their guest list, even if it strains family relations. The sister's reaction is her own decision, but the author's actions are justified in maintaining the wedding's intended atmosphere.\n"
