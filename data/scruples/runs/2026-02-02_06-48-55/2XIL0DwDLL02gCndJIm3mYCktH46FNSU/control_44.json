I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at their wedding. The sister's new boyfriend is causing issues because he's unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The writer doesn't want him at the wedding because they don't get along with him, and they replaced the plus one with a cousin. The sister is now threatening not to come if he's not included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around weddings and family dynamics. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for the couple to decide the guest list. The writer has the right to exclude someone they don't want there, especially if it's a destination wedding where they've already invested a lot financially. However, the sister is pushing back hard, saying she won't attend without her boyfriend. That's a big deal because the sister is a close family member, and her absence could cause family tension.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they want an intimate event with close friends and family, and this boyfriend doesn't fit that. But since it's a new relationship (6 months), maybe it's not as entrenched as if they had known him longer. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the writer might be overstepping by rescinding the plus one. However, the writer did offer a replacement (their cousin), so maybe they're trying to minimize the impact on the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, excluding someone's partner, even a new one, can be seen as cutting them off, which might be harsh. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The writer has to weigh the importance of their own comfort against the potential loss of a sibling relationship. It's a tough call. But in terms of who is in the wrong, the writer might not be in the wrong because they have the right to set the guest list. However, maybe they didn't consider the sister's feelings enough. But given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because weddings are personal, and the writer has the authority over who attends.\n"
