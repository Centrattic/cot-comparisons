I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The situation is that the sister's new boyfriend is disliked by the immediate family because he's unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The author decided to cut him from the guest list, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to take his place. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family. The author's reasoning is about wanting everyone at the wedding to be someone they enjoy. But the sister is pushing back, possibly because the boyfriend is new and she feels he should be included. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to set the guest list for their own wedding. They might feel that including someone they dislike would ruin the experience. On the other hand, the sister is important, and threatening to not attend because of this could cause a bigger issue. Rescinding a plus one last minute might be harsh, especially if the sister had planned to bring him. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior is an issue. If he's a moocher, unemployed, and talkative, maybe the author has valid concerns about his presence. But the sister has a right to her choice in companions. However, the author isn't banning the sister; they're just removing the boyfriend. \n\nThe key points are the timing (last minute), the sister's reaction, and the balance between the author's comfort and the sister's feelings. The author might be justified in wanting their wedding to be pleasant, but the way it's handled could be problematic. If the sister doesn't come, it could create lasting family tension. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they're managing their own event. But it's a close call because they could have tried to mediate the situation earlier or found a compromise. However, since they did find a replacement and it's a destination wedding, maybe the decision is reasonable. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author might have been more considerate in timing. Still, the main issue is the author's right to their own guest list. So I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
