I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man getting married in April. He had given his sister, who's 24, a plus-one spot because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. Now she's with a new boyfriend, and the author and his immediate family don't like this guy. The guy is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off his sister, and talks too much. The author decided to rescind the plus-one, even though it's last-minute, and managed to get a cousin to take the spot instead. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend can't attend, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, weddings are usually a big deal, and guest lists can be a point of contention. The author originally gave the plus-one because of the ex, and now that the sister has a new partner, he doesn't want him there. The issue is whether rescinding the plus-one is fair, especially when the sister is now threatening to not attend without her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the key points here: the sister was given a plus-one initially. Now, the author is changing that. The sister is upset and considering not coming. The author is trying to keep the wedding intimate with close friends and family, but the boyfriend doesn't fit that. However, the sister is a guest herself; if she's not coming, that's a bigger issue for the author, since family is usually expected to be there.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to enjoy everyone at the wedding, so excluding the boyfriend makes sense. But the sister is now in a position where she's not attending if her plus-one is removed. That's a problem. The author might have anticipated this but went ahead anyway. \n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to include people he doesn't like? The plus-one was given initially, so maybe there was an understanding. Now, changing it last-minute could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in a tough spot, but excluding someone the sister is bringing could lead to her not attending, which is worse. The author's intention is to have an intimate event, but family can't be excluded so easily. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's behavior is a concern\u2014unemployed, mooching, talkative. But is that enough to justify rescinding the plus-one? The author's family doesn't like him, but maybe the sister should have to deal with that. However, the sister might feel her autonomy is being violated. \n\nAnother angle: the author is the one hosting the wedding, so he has control over the guest list. But the sister is a family member, and excluding her boyfriend might push her to exclude herself. The author might be prioritizing the vibe of the wedding over family attendance, which could backfire. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is in a tough spot. The sister had a plus-one, and now it's revoked. The author's family's discomfort is valid, but the sister's reaction is also a factor. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the consequences of his sister not attending, which could be worse. On the other hand, the author has the right to set the guest list. \n\nBut the main issue is the last-minute change and the sister's response. The author might have had the right to change the guest list, but the sister's threat complicates it. If the author is okay with his sister not coming, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the author values his sister's presence, then rescinding the plus-one might not be worth it. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user says the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key factors are: the plus-one was given, the author changed it last-minute, the sister is now threatening to leave, and the author's reason is about the wedding's vibe. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he didn't foresee or accept the consequence of his sister not attending. Even if the boyfriend is unwelcome, the sister is family and likely expected to be there. The author might have been better off talking to his sister first, finding a compromise, or considering the impact. By rescinding the plus-one unilaterally, he's put the sister in a position where she might miss the wedding, which is a bigger issue. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
