I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding where the author, a 27-year-old man, rescinded his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had given the sister a plus one before, when she was with a different boyfriend. Now, with a new boyfriend, they don't like the new guy. He's unemployed, mooching off her, and talks too much. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him, but the sister is upset and might not come. The author wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family.\n\nNow, thinking about typical wedding etiquette. Usually, the couple has the final say on who attends their wedding. They can decide the guest list based on their preferences. So, the author isn't wrong in that sense. However, there's the relationship aspect here with his sister. By rescinding the plus one, the author is potentially causing conflict with a family member. The sister is threatening to not attend, which could be a big deal since family is important. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's reasoning is based on wanting an intimate event and the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, maybe he's justified. On the other hand, the sister hasn't been with the boyfriend that long (6 months), so maybe the author should have more flexibility. However, the author did give her a plus one before, and now is changing the policy. That could be seen as inconsistent. But again, he's the one paying for the wedding and has the right to set the guest list. \n\nAnother angle: if the sister feels her partner is being excluded because of personal dislike rather than objective reasons, that could be an issue. The author mentions the boyfriend is unemployed and talks too much. But that's a personal judgment. Maybe the author is imposing their standards on others. However, the author's right to choose who attends their event is a common stance. \n\nIn many cases, the couple can make such decisions without being in the wrong, even if it causes family tension. So the answer might be B (No). But if the author changed the policy after the relationship started, maybe that's a problem. However, the original plus one was conditional on the previous boyfriend. The author didn't have to include future partners. So maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that excluding the boyfriend could be a breach of trust or family support. However, the author's main point is about the wedding's atmosphere. So, considering all, the answer is B.\n"
