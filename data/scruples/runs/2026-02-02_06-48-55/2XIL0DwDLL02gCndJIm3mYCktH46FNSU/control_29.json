I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's boyfriend because they don't like him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is getting married, gave their sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, the sister started dating someone new. The author doesn't like this new guy\u2014unemployed, mooches off the sister, talks too much. They rescinded the plus one, found a replacement (their cousin), but the sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Wedding planning can be tricky, especially with family dynamics. The author's reasoning is that they want an intimate wedding with people they like. But the sister is upset and might not attend without her boyfriend.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, weddings are personal events, and the host should be comfortable with all attendees. If the boyfriend is a source of discomfort for the author and their family, maybe it's reasonable to not include him. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her relationship is being judged, and excluding her partner could make her feel excluded, especially if they've only been dating six months.\n\nBut wait, the author did give the sister a plus one initially, which the sister used for her boyfriend. The author might have the right to adjust who's invited, especially if the person is causing issues. However, the sister's threat to miss the wedding if her boyfriend isn't invited is a strong reaction. The author is trying to maintain a comfortable environment, but the sister's reaction could be seen as an overreaction, especially if the couple's relationship is relatively new.\n\nAlso, the author found a replacement (the cousin), so there's no financial loss. That shows they tried to be fair. However, the sister might feel that her personal life is being interfered with. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, mooching, talkative) might be valid reasons for the author's discomfort.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set the tone for their wedding, and if they genuinely dislike the boyfriend, excluding him is their choice. The sister's threat seems extreme, and the author made a reasonable adjustment. So the answer is B.\n"
