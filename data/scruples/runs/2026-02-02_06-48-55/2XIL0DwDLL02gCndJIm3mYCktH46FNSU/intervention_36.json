I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the wedding planner (the author) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one because they don't like the new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author gave their sister a plus one originally because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring. The new boyfriend is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding and found another plus one (their cousin). The sister is threatening not to come if her boyfriend isn't included.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are personal events, and it's reasonable to want guests to be people they know and get along with. The author's main reasoning is maintaining an intimate setting with close friends and family. They did give the sister a plus one initially, so maybe there was an assumption that the guest would be known or acceptable. The new boyfriend's behavior and lifestyle (unemployed) might be a concern for the author's comfort and the event's atmosphere.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister is an invited guest. The author's decision affects her significantly. Threatening to not come if her boyfriend is excluded is a strong reaction. However, the sister might feel that her autonomy in choosing her plus one is being overruled. The author's action could be seen as imposing their preferences on their sister, especially after a significant decision (a destination wedding) is made.\n\nPossible factors to consider: The timing (last minute) could be a problem if it's causing financial or logistical issues, but the author mentioned they found a replacement to avoid losing money. The sister's feelings are important here. The author's right to have a comfortable environment is valid, but so is the sister's right to attend with someone she's close to.\n\nAnother angle: If the plus one was part of the original invitation, then changing it now could be seen as unfair, especially if the sister didn't have prior notice. The author might feel they have the final say since it's their wedding, but the sister's exclusion could lead to a family rift.\n\nI need to weigh these aspects. The author's concern about the guest list being intimate and the new boyfriend being undesirable is understandable. However, rescinding the plus one might cause more harm by losing the sister's presence. The author could have addressed the issue earlier instead of at the last minute. The sister's reaction is intense, but maybe the author overstepped by not considering their sibling's feelings.\n\nIn similar situations, some people argue that the host has the final say on guests, but others think that family members' plus ones should be respected unless there's a serious issue. The boyfriend's behavior is a problem, but it's the sister's choice to bring him. The author's decision could be seen as valid if they have a legitimate reason, but the timing and the way it's handled might be the issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (Yes), then the reasoning would be that they didn't consider their sister's autonomy and made a last-minute change causing conflict. If B (No), it's about the author's right to control the guest list for their comfort.\n\nI think it's a tough call. But given that the sister is an invited guest and the author's decision is based on personal dislike of the boyfriend, maybe the author is overstepping. The sister's potential absence is a major consequence. However, the author's right to an intimate event with people they can get along with is also valid. The key is whether the author's action was reasonable. Since the sister didn't have prior conditions on her plus one, rescinding it now could be seen as wrong. So, A.\n"
