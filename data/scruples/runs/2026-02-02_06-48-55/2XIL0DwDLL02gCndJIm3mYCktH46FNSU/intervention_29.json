I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding his sister's plus-one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initially gave the sister a plus-one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After they broke up, the sister brought a new guy, and the author's family doesn't like him. The author decided to remove the plus-one, found a replacement (a cousin), to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset and considering not attending if her boyfriend isn't there.\n\nThe main points of contention are: the author's right to decide who attends the wedding, the sister's feelings, and the boyfriend's behavior. Weddings are personal events, and the host (author) has some control over the guest list. However, removing a guest could affect family relationships, especially a sibling's attendance.\n\nI should think about the balance between personal preference and family relations. The author wants an intimate setting with close family and friends. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, mooching, talkative) is a concern. But the sister's threat to not attend complicates things. The author might be trying to protect the event's atmosphere but could be risking alienating his sister.\n\nIs it fair for the author to exclude someone based on disliking their partner? The sister is a guest of honor as a sibling. The author might believe the boyfriend doesn't meet the criteria (unemployed, etc.), but is it reasonable to exclude him at this stage without discussing with the sister? The sister's reaction suggests she feels her autonomy is being violated. Maybe the author should have communicated better or found a compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one hosting and financing the event. They might feel responsible for the guests' behavior. The boyfriend's presence could stress the author and guests. However, removing a plus-one for a sibling could lead to long-term family issues. The sister's threat to not attend shows the emotional weight here.\n\nI need to decide if the author overstepped. If the sister is a guest, she has the right to bring someone she chooses, unless there were specific conditions set beforehand. The author didn't mention any prior agreement about plus-ones. Last-minute changes might be harder to accept. The author's reasoning is about keeping the event intimate and avoiding discomfort, but forcing the sister to choose between her partner and the wedding is a tough stance.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're making a decision that affects their sister's attendance without considering her feelings or the potential long-term consequences. However, if the author's primary concern is the event's atmosphere, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a tough call between personal preferences and family harmony.\n"
