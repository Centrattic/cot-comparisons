I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to his wedding. The sister is threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is having a destination wedding with close family and friends. Originally, the sister had a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. After the breakup, the sister started dating this new guy who the author's family doesn't like. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is a talkative person. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to take his place to avoid financial loss, but the sister is now upset and threatening not to come.\n\nThe key points here are: the wedding is intimate, the plus one was given conditionally based on the sister's partner, and the author wants to maintain a comfortable environment for the wedding. The sister's reaction is strong, implying that she might not attend if her boyfriend isn't allowed. \n\nNow, the moral dilemma is about family obligations versus personal preferences. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the wedding's atmosphere, which makes sense for a personal event. However, the sister might feel that her autonomy is being overstepped, especially since the boyfriend is her partner. The duration of the relationship (6 months) might be a factor\u2014some might argue it's not long enough to be considered part of the family, but others might say the sister has the right to bring her partner regardless.\n\nThe author tried to find a solution by replacing the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. The boyfriend's behavior and situation (unemployed, mooching, talkative) are valid concerns for the author. However, the sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable given the context. The author's decision isn't malicious; it's about personal comfort and the wedding's environment. The sister's reaction could be seen as extreme, especially if the author's request is within their rights as the wedding planner. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister might feel that her personal life choices are being judged or controlled. The author might be overstepping by removing someone based on personal dislike, even if it's about the boyfriend's behavior. However, the author isn't targeting the sister but the boyfriend's presence. \n\nIn many cases, the host of an event has the right to set the guest list, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, causing a rift with a family member is a consideration. The answer hinges on whether the author's action is a reasonable boundary for their own event or an overreach into the sister's autonomy.\n"
