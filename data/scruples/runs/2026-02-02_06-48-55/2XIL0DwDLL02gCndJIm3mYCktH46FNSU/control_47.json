I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The brother is getting married and initially gave his sister a plus one. After their breakup, the sister started dating a new guy. The brother and his family don't like this new boyfriend\u2014unemployed, talks too much, mooches off her. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, found a replacement, but the sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't included. The brother wants the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the brother is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, weddings are personal events, and the brother might feel that having someone he can't stand there would ruin his day. He's trying to keep it close-knit. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her choice of partner is her business, and her brother is overstepping by excluding him. Also, the sister might be prioritizing her partner's inclusion over attending the wedding herself.\n\nBut the brother did replace the plus one with a cousin, so maybe he's not cutting the sister entirely but just the boyfriend. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe she feels her relationship is being judged. However, the brother's right to set boundaries for his own wedding is a factor here. \n\nIn many cases, weddings are the couple's event, and they do have the right to decide the guest list. If the boyfriend is causing discomfort and the brother wants a small guest list, it's reasonable to exclude someone who's disruptive. The sister's threat to not come at all might be an overreaction, but it shows the emotional weight of the situation.\n\nSo, considering that the brother is trying to maintain the intimacy and his own comfort, and the sister's boyfriend is problematic, the brother's decision might be justified. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
