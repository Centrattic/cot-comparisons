I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because they don't like him. The author is getting married, and the sister's new boyfriend has some issues like unemployment, mooching off her, and being very talkative. The author decided to take back the plus one, found a replacement (their cousin), but the sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics. The original plus one was given when the sister had a previous boyfriend. After the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. The new boyfriend is problematic in the eyes of the author and their family. The main points are the author's right to decide wedding guests and the sister's potential reaction.\n\nWeddings are personal events. Typically, the wedding party has the final say on who attends, especially since it's their event. The author is concerned about the intimate setting with close friends and family, and the presence of someone they dislike might affect that. However, rescinding a plus one could be seen as cutting off the sister's autonomy, especially if the boyfriend is a part of her life now. The sister's threat to not attend complicates things because it pits the author against their sibling.\n\nThe author might argue that they have the right to control their own event, especially when there are financial and personal reasons. The sister's boyfriend's behavior could be a valid concern. However, the sister might feel disrespected or excluded, leading to family tension. The timing is also an issue\u2014last-minute changes can be stressful, but the author managed to replace the guest without financial loss.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at intentions. The author didn't want someone they dislike at their event, which is understandable. But the sister's reaction shows the potential cost of this decision on family relations. The boyfriend's issues are real, but the author's decision could be seen as meddling in the sister's personal life. \n\nBalancing these aspects, the key is whether the author overstepped. If the wedding is intended to include close family and the author genuinely believes the boyfriend wouldn't be a good fit, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the decision is based on personal dislike without sufficient cause, that's different. The boyfriend's unemployment and talkativeness are factors, but they're subjective. The sister's threat to not attend is a possible consequence the author didn't consider. \n\nUltimately, while the author has the right to manage their wedding guest list, the way they handled it and the potential fallout with their sister might make them at least partially responsible. The answer might lean towards \"A\" (in the wrong) because the decision could be seen as prioritizing personal comfort over family harmony, but there's a strong case for \"B\" as well. The community often considers both sides, but in this case, the author's actions might be justified given their event's nature.\n"
