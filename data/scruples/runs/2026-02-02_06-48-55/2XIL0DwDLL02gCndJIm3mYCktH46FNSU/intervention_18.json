I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 27M, is getting married and had given his sister a plus one. Originally, the sister had a previous boyfriend they liked, but now she's with a new guy that the family doesn't like. The author decided to rescind the plus one because they don't want this new boyfriend at the wedding. The sister is upset and might not come if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nThe key points here are: the sister is attending with a plus one, the author doesn't like the new boyfriend, they've already made arrangements for a cousin to take the spot, and the sister is threatening to not come if her boyfriend can't go.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the wedding is supposed to be an intimate event with close friends and family. The author has the right to decide the guest list, as it's their event. The boyfriend is a plus one, not a family member, so the author might feel responsible for the vibe of the guests. The fact that the author made a last-minute change but managed to avoid losing money by having a cousin substitute shows they tried to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has already formed a relationship with this person, and the author's decision is causing her to consider not attending. Family dynamics can be complicated, and cutting off a plus one might be seen as dismissive. However, the sister was given the plus one initially as a courtesy, and the author had the right to revoke it if they felt it would affect the event's atmosphere. The boyfriend's behavior (unemployed, talkative, mooching) is described negatively, which might justify the author's concerns.\n\nBut, the sister's reaction of threatening not to attend could be a bigger issue. However, the author made a decision they think is necessary for their own event. The ethical dilemma here is balancing personal preference with family obligations. The author isn't excluding a family member but a plus one. Since the plus one is not a family member, the author's decision might be justified. However, the sister's feelings are hurt, but the author's right to the guest list is also valid.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the wedding planners have control over the guest list, especially for plus ones. The fact that they made a last-minute substitution but still lost a guest (the sister) is a consequence, but it's their choice. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a call to protect their event's atmosphere, which is their right. The sister's decision to withdraw is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to include someone they dislike, even if they are a plus one.\n"
