I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 27-year-old male getting married, and he had given his 24-year-old sister a plus one. Originally, she had a boyfriend they liked, but after a breakup, she's with a new guy. They don't like the new guy\u2014unemployed, seems to mooch, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute. They found a cousin to fill in so there's no financial loss. The sister is now threatening not to attend without her boyfriend, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. I need to weigh the arguments.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wants his wedding to be intimate with only close friends and family. He doesn't want someone who's not close to him or his family to be there because he can't stand the guy. He tried to make it up by giving the plus one to a cousin instead. The sister is upset, but maybe she should have considered the family's feelings when choosing to bring someone who hasn't been around long.\n\nFrom the sister's side: She's been given a plus one before, and now it's rescinded, making her feel like her choice of partner isn't respected. She's been with him six months, so maybe she's attached. Threatening not to come is extreme, but she feels the decision is unfair. The author is limiting her autonomy in who she brings, even if it's a plus one.\n\nEthically, weddings are typically about the couple and their immediate family. Extended family and their partners might be included, but the couple usually has control over the guest list. The sister's boyfriend is not part of that close group. The author's reasoning is about maintaining an intimate atmosphere, which is a valid concern for a destination wedding where space and costs are concerns.\n\nBut the sister's reaction is also a factor. If the wedding is important to the family, losing a sister might be a bigger issue than the boyfriend. However, the author might feel that the presence of someone he dislikes would ruin the event. The fact that they found a cousin to take the spot shows they tried to mitigate financial loss, which is considerate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The sister's boyfriend has a right to attend if she's bringing him. But the plus one is a privilege given by the couple, not a right. The author has the right to decide who attends, especially if it's a close-knit event. The sister's threat to skip the wedding is a strong response, but the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing his guest list preferences.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on his comfort and the event's nature. The sister's choice to bring someone the family dislikes might have been a mistake. The answer should be B.\n"
