I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one at the wedding because they don't like the boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is a destination event, which can be expensive. The brother had given the sister a plus one originally when she was with her ex, and after the breakup, they waited to see who she'd bring next. Now the new boyfriend is causing issues. The brother doesn't want him there because of his behavior and unemployment. They found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they want the wedding to be with close friends and family, and they don't want someone they dislike there. The sister's side is that the boyfriend is part of her life now, and she feels he should be included, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nHmm. Weddings are personal events, and the host usually has the final say on the guest list. But there's a family relationship here. The sister is upset because her partner is being excluded. The brother might feel that the boyfriend is not a good fit for the wedding's vibe. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to choose who attends their wedding. On the other hand, cutting off the plus one could lead to family conflict, especially if the sister is threatening not to attend. The brother might be prioritizing his comfort over his sister's feelings. \n\nBut the sister is threatening not to come at all, which is a big deal. Maybe the brother should have communicated earlier? Or considered the impact on the sister. However, the wedding is his, so he might feel justified. \n\nI think the key points are the right to control the guest list versus the potential family fallout. The author's reasoning is that it's an intimate event and they want to enjoy everyone there. The sister's argument is about her relationship. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the wedding is their event, but there's a nuance in handling the situation tactfully. However, the sister's reaction might be an overreaction. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (No) because the author has the right to decide, even if it causes tension.\n"
