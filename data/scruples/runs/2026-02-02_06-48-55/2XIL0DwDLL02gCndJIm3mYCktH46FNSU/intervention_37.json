I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for a sister's new boyfriend at the wedding. The author gave the sister a plus one initially when she was with a previous boyfriend they liked. After the breakup, the sister started dating someone new, whom the author's family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talkative, mooching. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid losing money, but the sister is now threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't included. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are significant events, and inviting guests is a personal decision. The author is the one getting married, so they might have the right to choose their guests. However, the sister is a family member, and rescinding her plus one could strain their relationship. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening to not come because of this. \n\nOn one hand, the author's reasoning is that the wedding should be an intimate event with close family and friends, and they want to enjoy everyone present. The boyfriend's behavior is described as problematic, which might make the author uncomfortable. On the other hand, the sister is being excluded from the wedding entirely because her boyfriend isn't allowed. That could be seen as harsh, especially since they've only been dating six months. The author might be overstepping by removing the plus one, even if it's to avoid conflict. The sister's presence is also important\u2014should the author have to compromise their comfort for the sister to attend?\n\nI think the key factors here are the author's right to choose their wedding guests versus the sister's right to attend with her own plus one. The author's decision might be justified if they believe the boyfriend's presence would ruin the event, but the sister's reaction complicates things. If the sister is a close family member, the author might need to weigh the importance of keeping that relationship. However, the author could argue that the wedding is their day and they have the right to set the terms. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of timing\u2014rescinding last minute might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the sister might feel that her new relationship is being judged, which could be hurtful. The author's family not liking the boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative) might be their personal opinion, but that doesn't necessarily make the author in the wrong. However, using family judgment to exclude someone from a wedding can be seen as unfair, especially if the sister is willing to forgo the wedding over it.\n\nIn summary, there's a balance between the author's comfort and the sister's feelings. The author might be in the right if the wedding is supposed to be intimate and the boyfriend is a disruptive presence, but excluding the sister could have lasting family consequences. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the value placed on family in this context.\n"
