I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy getting married and he rescinded his sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if he isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author gave the sister a plus one before, but after the breakup, they waited. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author doesn't want him at the wedding, which is supposed to be intimate. They managed to substitute the plus one with the cousin to avoid losing money. The sister is upset and says she won't come without him.\n\nSo, the key issues here are about control over who attends the wedding, the timing of the decision, and the sister's reaction. Weddings are personal, and the author wants an intimate event with close people. However, rescinding a plus one so close to the event might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the sister is now threatening to not attend. \n\nIs it fair to exclude someone based on dislike? The author's reasoning is that they want to enjoy everyone there. But the sister is bringing the boyfriend, so maybe the author should have communicated earlier if they had issues. Also, the sister might feel that since the author initially offered a plus one, she has a right to bring someone even if they don't like him. \n\nTiming is another factor. The wedding is in April, and this decision might be causing last-minute stress. Maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier when they met the boyfriend. Also, considering the sister's threat to leave, the author might need to find a compromise, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn typical \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the answer often hinges on respect and communication. If the author didn't communicate their discomfort earlier and now unilaterally rescinds the plus one, that could be seen as wrong. However, if the wedding is indeed supposed to be intimate with close friends and family, excluding someone who doesn't fit that vibe might be justified. But since the sister is family, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like not allowing plus ones for family members or setting clearer expectations from the start.\n\nAnother angle is that the author found a substitute (the cousin) to avoid financial loss, which is considerate, but the sister feels the relationship is important enough to prioritize. The six-month relationship might not be long enough for the sister to feel the boyfriend is a significant part of her life, but she still wants him there.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's right to have a wedding they're comfortable with versus the sister's right to attend with her partner. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it sooner and now risking the sister's attendance. Alternatively, the author is justified in wanting to keep the wedding intimate. But rescinding a plus one close to the event and causing the sister to not come might be seen as the author's fault. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't manage expectations early and now are making a late decision that affects family. But I'm a bit split because the author's reasoning about the wedding atmosphere is valid. However, the sister's reaction and the timing could make the author the asshole here.\n"
