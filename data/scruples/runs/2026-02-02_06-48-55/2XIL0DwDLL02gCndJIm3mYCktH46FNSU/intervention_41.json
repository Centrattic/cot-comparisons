I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if the boyfriend isn't included.\n\nFirst, the brother originally gave the sister a plus one because of her previous boyfriend. Now, the new boyfriend has some red flags: unemployed, mooching off her, and very talkative. The brother doesn't want him at the wedding, which is supposed to be intimate with close friends and family. They found a cousin to take the place to avoid financial loss. The sister is upset because she wants her partner there, even though they've only been dating six months.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wedding is the brother's event, and he might feel it's his right to choose who attends, especially since it's a small, intimate gathering. On the other hand, the sister is being excluded from the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed, which could be seen as punishing her for her relationship choice. \n\nBut the sister chose the boyfriend, and the brother is within his rights to not want someone he dislikes at his wedding. However, is it fair to rescind the plus one so close to the wedding? The brother did find a replacement to avoid financial loss, which is good. But the sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. \n\nIs the brother being unreasonable? Maybe. The sister is an invited guest, and removing her plus one might affect her willingness to come. But the brother's main concern is about the atmosphere of the wedding. If the boyfriend would make the event uncomfortable for him, his family, or others, then maybe he's justified. \n\nHowever, the sister's relationship is her own, and the brother's disapproval shouldn't necessarily override her right to attend with her partner. There's a balance here between personal preferences and family obligations. \n\nI think the key points are: the wedding is the brother's, intimacy is important, the sister's threat to not attend is a big deal, and the timing of the decision. The brother's reasoning is about maintaining a comfortable environment, but excluding someone's partner can be hurtful. \n\nIn many cases, weddings do allow guests to bring someone, even if the host doesn't like them, unless there are specific restrictions. The brother did allow the sister to have a plus one before, so changing that now might be seen as unfair. Plus, the sister is being penalized for her partner's actions, not her own. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his personal dislike onto his sister's attendance. However, if the boyfriend's presence would genuinely disrupt the wedding, it's a valid concern. It's a tough call. But I lean towards the brother being in the wrong because relationships are private, and the sister shouldn't be forced to choose between her partner and her brother's event. The brother could have addressed his concerns without rescinding the plus one, perhaps by setting boundaries or having a conversation with the sister and her boyfriend to see if they can manage the situation.\n"
