I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (27M) decided to rescind their sister's (24F) plus one for their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The sister is now threatening not to attend if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is a personal event, and the author wants it to be intimate with close friends and family. The sister had a plus one before, but now with the new boyfriend, the author is uncomfortable. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching off the sister, and very talkative. The author managed to get a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss.\n\nNow, the key points: Is rescinding the plus one fair? The sister is upset and might not attend if the boyfriend isn't there. The author's reasoning is about wanting the wedding to be with people they enjoy. But the sister is now in a new relationship, and it's only been six months. The author's actions might affect the sister's attendance, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is prioritizing their own comfort and the wedding's vibe. Weddings are personal, and people do often curate their guest list to avoid conflict. However, the sister is being excluded because of her partner, which might be seen as unfair to her. The sister might feel that her new relationship is being judged, especially since it's relatively new. Also, the boyfriend's traits are presented as problematic, so the author's concern about the wedding atmosphere is understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author did give the sister a plus one initially, which was rescinded after the new boyfriend came into the picture. The author might believe they have the right to decide the guest list, especially since it's their event. However, the sister's reaction of potentially not attending is a significant consequence. The author is causing a rift in the family because of a disagreement over a guest. It's possible that the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it with the sister earlier or finding a compromise.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on fairness and communication. The author acted without considering the sister's feelings, leading to a potential family conflict. While the author's reasons are understandable, the way it's handled might be where they go wrong. The sister's threat to not attend because of the plus one exclusion is a strong indicator that the author's decision is causing harm beyond just the boyfriend's presence. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over family harmony, which can be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm not 100% sure. However, in typical AITA threads, people often side with the person who's standing up for their event's integrity unless there's a clear injustice. But here, excluding a partner due to personal dislike could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is now being punished for her relationship. The author's actions are causing a family member to miss the event, which is a big deal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a middle ground or considering the sister's feelings more.\n"
