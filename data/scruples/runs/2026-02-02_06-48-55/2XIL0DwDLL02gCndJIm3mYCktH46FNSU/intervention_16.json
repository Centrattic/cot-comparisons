I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 27-year-old man who rescinded his sister's plus one for his wedding because he doesn't like her new boyfriend. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't allowed. The author says they wanted the wedding to be intimate with close friends and family, and the boyfriend is 31, unemployed, and talks too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author originally gave the sister a plus one when she was with her ex, which was enjoyed by the family. Now the new boyfriend is causing issues. The author made a last-minute decision to rescind the plus one, replacing it with a cousin to avoid costs. The sister is upset and might not attend if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to rescind the plus one? Is it reasonable to exclude someone based on personal dislike? How important is the guest list in a wedding, especially a destination one which is expensive and more exclusive?\n\nWeddings are typically the couple's event, so they usually have the final say on the guest list. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister might feel that since the plus one was given before, it should be honored unless there's a valid reason. The author's reasons are based on personal dislike, not safety or appropriateness. The boyfriend's unemployment and talking might be subjective issues. The sister could feel that her partner is part of her life now and should be included. \n\nThe author might be in the right because it's their wedding and they can set the guest list. But on the other hand, excluding the sister's partner could cause family conflict, and the sister's threat to not attend might be a significant consequence. The timing is also a factor since it's last-minute. \n\nHowever, the author tried to mitigate the cost by getting a cousin to fill in, which is a good point. But the sister's reaction might indicate that she values the boyfriend more than the wedding, which is a personal choice. \n\nIn traditional terms, the wedding couple is responsible for the guest list. However, if the sister is a close family member, there's a balance between personal preference and family relationships. The author's reasoning is based on personal discomfort, not objective issues like safety or financial strain beyond the plus one. \n\nSo, from a strict standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because it's their event. However, the sister's potential no-show complicates things. But the core issue is the guest list control. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's their choice, but they need to weigh the importance of family. Given the options, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
