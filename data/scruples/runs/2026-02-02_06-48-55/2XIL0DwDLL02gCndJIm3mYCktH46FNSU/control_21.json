I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who's getting married in April. They had given their sister, who's 24, a plus one because they liked her previous boyfriend. After they broke up, they waited to see who she'd bring next. Now, the sister brought a new boyfriend, but the author and their immediate family don't like him. The guy is 31, unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him to avoid losing money, and now the sister is threatening not to come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed to attend. The author wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family and doesn't want people they don't like there. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rules of weddings. Generally, weddings are the couple's event, and they can choose their guests. Plus ones are often given at the discretion of the couple. If the sister was given a plus one initially because of her ex, it's reasonable to rescind it if the new person doesn't fit the vibe or if there are issues. The author mentions that the family doesn't like the boyfriend for valid reasons\u2014unemployed, mooching, and being very talkative. These are legitimate concerns, especially for an intimate event where everyone's presence is important.\n\nThe sister's reaction of threatening not to come is a problem. The author is making a choice about their own wedding guests, which is their right. The sister should not be allowed to dictate the guest list in that way. Even though the sister has only been dating the guy for six months, the author's right to control the guest list is more about the event they're hosting. The cousin filling in the spot to avoid financial loss is a good step, showing consideration for expenses.\n\nHowever, there might be arguments that the sister could have chosen not to bring the boyfriend if she knew the family's preferences. But the author didn't explicitly state any rules about not bringing new partners. The sister might have thought the plus one was a given, which the author could have clarified earlier. But the author did wait to see who she would bring after the breakup, so maybe they assumed she'd find someone they liked. When she didn't, rescinding the plus one is within their rights.\n\nThe key points are: the author's wedding, the choice of guests, the sister's threat to not attend, and the boyfriend's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the authority to set the guest list for their wedding. The sister's reaction is unreasonable, and the author handled it by finding a replacement to avoid financial waste. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
