I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The brother is 27, the sister is 24. They have a destination wedding in the Caribbean. Originally, the sister had a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now she's with a new guy, and the family doesn't like him\u2014unemployed, mooching, talks too much. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace the spot to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the brother is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer (A or B). Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the brother is the one getting married. Weddings are personal events, and he might want to keep it intimate with close friends and family. If the new boyfriend is a source of discomfort, it's his right to set the tone for his event. Also, they managed to replace the plus one with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. That seems fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being excluded because of her partner, which might be seen as punishing her. The boyfriend has only been with her for six months, which is relatively new. Maybe the brother and family didn't give him a fair chance. Also, the sister is threatening to not attend, which could be a big consequence. Is the brother overstepping by making a decision that affects her attendance?\n\nAnother angle: The initial plus one was given based on the ex-boyfriend. When the relationship changed, the brother had the right to reassess. However, rescinding it so close to the event might be last-minute, but they found a replacement. The sister's reaction might be exaggerated if she's willing to miss the wedding over it. Still, family dynamics can be complex. The brother's actions might be seen as selfish if he's prioritizing his comfort over his sister's feelings.\n\nBut weddings are the couple's event. The guests are typically chosen by the couple. If the new boyfriend is making others uncomfortable, it's reasonable to exclude him. The sister could bring someone else, but she's choosing to bring someone who's disruptive. The brother might be within his rights to say no. However, the sister's threat to not come is a significant consequence. Maybe there's a middle ground, like talking to the sister first before rescinding, but the brother might have felt it was necessary for the wedding's atmosphere.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the actions were unreasonable. The brother made a decision to maintain his desired guest list, replaced the plus one, and the sister is now retaliating. The boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern. So, the brother isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
