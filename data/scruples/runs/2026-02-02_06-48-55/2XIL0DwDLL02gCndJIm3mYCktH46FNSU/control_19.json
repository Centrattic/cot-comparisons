I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 27, getting married in April. They gave their sister a plus one because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the author's family (including the author) doesn't like. The boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last-minute, but they found a cousin to take his place so there's no financial loss. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend can't attend, as they've been dating for 6 months.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning, the sister's reaction, and the potential impact on the wedding. The author wants an intimate wedding with close friends and family. They believe it's their right to have everyone at the wedding be someone they enjoy. However, the sister is now excluding her from the event if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. On one hand, weddings are personal events, and the author has the right to set the guest list, especially if they designed it to be intimate. On the other hand, excluding someone's partner, even if they're new, could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister feels it's a form of rejection or disrespect towards her. The boyfriend's behavior might be a valid concern for the author's comfort, but it's also possible that the author is making a judgment based on personal dislike rather than objective issues.\n\nThe fact that the author replaced the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss might mitigate some of the blame, but it's still a last-minute change. The sister's threat to not attend is a significant consequence. The author might need to consider if the wedding is more important than the plus one. However, if the author genuinely doesn't want the boyfriend there, they might feel it's necessary despite the sister's reaction.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the validity of each party's feelings. The author's intention is to have a comfortable event, while the sister wants to include her partner. The boyfriend's traits are problematic, but it's the author's wedding. However, cutting off a family member entirely could be seen as extreme. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author decided to rescind the plus one. \n\nThe answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because it's their event and they should feel comfortable. However, the sister's reaction is also valid because she's being excluded from her own event. But since the author tried to find a replacement and the sister is prioritizing the boyfriend over the wedding, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
