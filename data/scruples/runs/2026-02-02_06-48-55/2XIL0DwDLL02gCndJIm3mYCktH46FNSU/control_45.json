I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rescinding his sister's plus one to his wedding. The situation is that the sister had a previous boyfriend, who was allowed to attend the wedding, but they broke up. Now she's with a new guy who the family doesn't like. The brother decided to rescind the plus one, causing the sister to threaten not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is a destination event, so there are probably costs involved. The brother and sister are both adults. The brother's main reasoning is that he wants the wedding to be intimate with only close friends and family. The sister's boyfriend is unemployed, seems to mooch off her, and is very talkative. The brother managed to replace the plus one with a cousin to avoid financial loss. The sister is now upset because she feels the boyfriend should come, and she might not attend if he's excluded.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, giving a plus one to a sister is common, but it's the family's decision who attends. The brother's concern is about the atmosphere of the event, which is important to him. However, he's removing someone from the guest list because of personal dislike, which might be seen as harsh. But the sister is using the threat of not attending to push back, which could be a problem for the brother's event.\n\nThe brother's actions might be seen as inconsiderate to his sister, but he's also trying to protect his own experience. The sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe her boyfriend's behavior is valid for concern. The brother did try to mitigate the financial loss by replacing the plus one, which is a good point. However, excluding someone from a wedding because the family dislikes them can be sensitive. The timeline is also an issue since it's last minute, which might cause stress for the sister.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The brother has the right to decide his wedding guests, but the way he handled it might have been abrupt. The sister's threat to not attend is also selfish. However, the brother's reasoning is based on wanting an intimate event without people he doesn't like. The boyfriend's traits are problematic, so the brother might have a valid reason. Still, excluding someone from a family event can be hurtful, so the brother might have a point. But the sister's reaction is also a problem. Overall, it's a tough call, but the brother might not be entirely in the wrong since he's the one hosting the event. But maybe he should have communicated better or found another solution. Hmm.\n"
