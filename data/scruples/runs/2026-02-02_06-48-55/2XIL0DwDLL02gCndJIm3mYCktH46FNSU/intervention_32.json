I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author rescinding their sister's plus one because they don't like her new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is getting married and initially gave their sister a plus one. When the sister started dating a new guy, the author and their immediate family don't like him. They find him unemployed, talkative, and a mooch. The author decided to rescind his plus one, even though it's last minute, and managed to get a cousin to replace him to avoid losing money. The sister is now threatening not to attend if her boyfriend isn't there.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding is intimate with close friends and family, and they want everyone there to be enjoyable. The sister has been going out for six months with this boyfriend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether it's right for the author to remove the sister's plus one. Let's break it down. \n\nWedding guest lists can be personal, and the author has the right to decide who attends their wedding. However, the sister's partner is her guest, and removing him might affect her attendance. The author tried to replace the guest, so no money is lost. But the sister is now threatening not to come, which complicates things. \n\nThe author might be within their rights to decide the guest list, but this action is causing family conflict. The sister might feel disrespected or that her relationship is being dismissed. The author's reasons are valid (not wanting someone they dislike at their event), but the sister's reaction is also a factor. \n\nIs it fair to prioritize the author's comfort over the sister's relationship? The sister's partner has been in the relationship for six months, and maybe the sister feels he's part of her life. The author's family didn't like the ex either, so maybe there's a pattern here. \n\nThe author could have tried to talk to the sister first to understand her perspective before rescinding. Communication might have been better. However, the author did act in a way that avoids financial loss, which is considerate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. The author's right to their guest list vs. the sister's right to attend with her partner. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cases, wedding guests are the couple's decision, but it can strain family relationships. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they have the right to their guest list. However, they could have handled it more sensitively. The sister's reaction is also extreme, but the author's action might be justified. So, the answer might be B (No), but the situation is nuanced.\n"
