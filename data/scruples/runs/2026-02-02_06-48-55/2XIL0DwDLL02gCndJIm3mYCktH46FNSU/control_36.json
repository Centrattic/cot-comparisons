I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (27M) is getting married and gave their sister (24F) a plus one. The sister had a previous boyfriend that everyone liked, but now she's with this new guy. The author and their family don't like him\u2014unemployed, mooching, talks too much. The author rescinds the plus one, finds a replacement (their cousin) to avoid losing money, but the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms around weddings. Typically, weddings are about the couple's preferences. They choose who attends, right? So the author's reasoning is that they want an intimate setting with close friends and family, and they don't want someone who's difficult. But the sister is making a big deal about it, even threatening to not come. \n\nIs the author's decision reasonable? They had a plus one for the sister before because of the previous boyfriend. Now that the guy is different, and the family doesn't like him, they decide to remove the plus one. They even replaced it with a cousin, so there's no financial loss. That seems considerate. \n\nBut the sister's reaction is strong. She's been going out for six months. Is six months enough for the author to have to tolerate someone they dislike? Maybe the author is being too controlling, but weddings are also a big deal. The sister might feel that her new partner is part of her life and should be included. \n\nHowever, the author's main point is about the wedding atmosphere. If the guy is disruptive, it could spoil the event. The author might be prioritizing their own event's comfort over the sister's relationship. But is that fair? The sister might feel that her personal life is being criticized. \n\nAlso, the timing is last minute. The author tried to handle it by replacing the plus one, which is good. But the sister is now threatening to leave the wedding entirely. That's a big threat. The author might not have anticipated that reaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, usually, the couple does have the final say on the guest list. So the author isn't in the wrong for removing someone they don't like. But maybe the sister's reaction is also a problem. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide their wedding guests. The sister's reaction is her issue, but the author's decision is within their rights.\n"
