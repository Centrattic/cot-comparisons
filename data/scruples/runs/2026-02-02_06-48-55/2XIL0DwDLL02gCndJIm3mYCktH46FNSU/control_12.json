I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about them rescinding their sister's plus one to their wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was given a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. When she brought a new guy, the author and their family don't like him. They mention he's unemployed, mooches off her, and talks too much. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, and found a cousin to take his place. The sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend can't attend.\n\nNow, wedding etiquette usually allows for plus ones for guests, especially siblings. However, if the guest is causing issues, the host might have the right to adjust. The author's reasoning is about keeping the wedding intimate and only with close friends and family. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014threatening to not come\u2014which complicates things.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting their event and their comfort. On the other, rescinding a plus one last minute could be seen as harsh, especially considering the sister's feelings. However, the sister had the opportunity to introduce someone else if they didn't like the new boyfriend earlier. The fact that the author found a replacement to avoid monetary loss might be a point in their favor. \n\nBut maybe the sister's boyfriend isn't the main issue. The sister is choosing her partner, and while the author dislikes him, they can't control who the sister dates. However, as the wedding is the author's event, they might have the right to set the guest list. The sister's reaction of threatening not to attend is extreme, which could indicate that the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're managing their own event and ensuring it's comfortable for them. The sister should have considered the family's feelings when choosing her partner. The author made a change to avoid conflict, which is reasonable. So the answer is B (No).\n"
