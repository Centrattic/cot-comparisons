I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for a sister's boyfriend at a destination wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author gave the sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex. After the breakup, the sister started dating someone new. The author dislikes the new boyfriend because he's unemployed, seems to mooch off the sister, and is very talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, replaced it with a cousin to avoid losing money, and now the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are personal and guests often expect to bring someone. The sister has been given a plus one before, and the new boyfriend has been in a relationship for 6 months. The author might feel that the wedding is supposed to be intimate and only with close friends and family. However, the author is making a judgment about the sister's partner, who is part of her immediate family. \n\nBut wait, the author is prioritizing their own comfort and the wedding's vibe over the sister's feelings. The sister might feel disrespected or that her relationship is not being acknowledged. The author's decision could be seen as dismissive of the sister's happiness. Also, the timing is last minute, which adds stress. \n\nThe author tried to mitigate financial loss by getting a cousin to take the spot. However, the sister's threat to not attend if her boyfriend isn't included is a significant consequence. The author might be causing a bigger rift by excluding someone the sister cares about. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, typically, guests can choose their plus ones, but once given, revoking it can be problematic. The author's reasoning is about personal preference, but it's also about the dynamics of the wedding. If the boyfriend's presence would really disrupt the event, maybe it's understandable. But the author should have considered the sister's feelings first. \n\nThe sister's reaction is extreme, but it's her right to feel that her partner should be included. The author's decision might be seen as meddling in the sister's relationship. Even if the boyfriend is not liked, the sister should have the autonomy to decide who accompanies her. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about the wedding's atmosphere, rescinding the plus one after the relationship has been ongoing for 6 months and causing the sister to potentially not attend might be seen as the author being in the wrong. The sister's autonomy and feelings should be a priority here.\n"
