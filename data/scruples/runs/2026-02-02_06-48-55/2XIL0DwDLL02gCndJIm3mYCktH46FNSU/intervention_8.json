I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (27M) is in the wrong for rescinding his sister's (24F) plus one to his wedding because they don't like her new boyfriend. The situation is that they originally gave the sister a plus one because they liked her ex, but now her new boyfriend is disliked by the immediate family. The author decided to rescind the plus one, and the sister is threatening not to attend if he isn't included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is an intimate event with close friends and family. The author values having everyone there enjoy each other, which is understandable. But the sister is now upset because her boyfriend is being excluded, which could lead her to not attend at all.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that it's important for the wedding to be pleasant for everyone, and this boyfriend is problematic. However, rescinding a plus one is a significant decision, especially close to the event. The sister's threat complicates things because the author might not want her to miss the wedding. \n\nI need to weigh the author's right to control his wedding guest list against the sister's feelings and autonomy. Typically, a wedding is a personal event, and the couple has the right to decide who attends. However, the sister's relationship with her partner is her choice, and excluding someone can be seen as a personal attack, especially if the issue is with the partner, not the sister herself.\n\nBut the sister is using her attendance as leverage. That's a problem. The author might think that excluding the boyfriend is necessary for the event's harmony, but forcing her to choose between her partner and the wedding is a tough spot. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the author didn't mention trying to mediate or find another solution. Instead, he made a unilateral decision, which might have been harsh.\n\nAlso, the timing is last-minute, which could add stress for both the sister and the boyfriend. The author did mention that they found a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid financial loss, but that might not address the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is truly problematic and the wedding is supposed to be intimate, the author's concern is valid. But the sister's reaction is also a factor. Maybe the author should have handled it more delicately, perhaps by discussing it with the sister first before rescinding. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether he could have done better.\n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are usually personal, but family dynamics can be complex. The sister's partner is her choice, so excluding him might be seen as interfering in her relationship unless there's a valid reason (like harassment, etc.), which isn't stated here. The issues mentioned are unemployment and being loud, which are subjective. What the author dislikes might not be objective problems.\n\nSo, the author's decision is based on personal dislike of the boyfriend, not on any harmful behavior. That could be a problem because it's subjective. The sister's partner is her partner, and her choice to bring him is her decision. The author is making a judgment based on personal taste, which might not be fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by rescinding the plus one for subjective reasons, leading to the sister's potential absence.\n\nBut the alternative is that the author is protecting his event's atmosphere. It's a balance between personal preferences and respecting the sister's relationship. Since the author is the one hosting the wedding, he has some leeway, but the sister's threat complicates it. Maybe the author should have found another way to handle the situation without excluding the boyfriend. But in the end, the answer hinges on whether excluding someone for subjective dislike is justifiable. \n\nGiven that the author didn't present the issue to the sister first, and the exclusion is based on personal preferences rather than objective harm, I think the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
