I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The sister is threatening not to come if he's excluded. The author thinks they should enjoy the wedding with people they like, especially since it's an intimate event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initially gave the sister a plus one when she was with her ex, which they liked. Now the sister has a new partner, and the author and their family don't get along with him. The author decided to cut the plus one, even though it's last minute, and managed to get a cousin to cover the cost. The sister is upset and might not attend without her boyfriend.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to choose their guests. But there's also family involved. The sister is a family member, and cutting off her plus one might hurt her feelings. The author is trying to keep it intimate with people they like. However, excluding someone's partner could be seen as unfair, especially if the relationship is new. The author might be overstepping by making a last-minute decision without considering the sister's feelings. The sister might feel that since the author gave her a plus one before, she should have one now, regardless of the partner's behavior. The author's main issue is the boyfriend's behavior, but maybe they should have addressed that with the sister first instead of just cutting the plus one. Also, the sister threatening not to come is a big consequence. The author needs to balance their own comfort with their sister's feelings. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for not communicating better. On the other hand, they have the right to set boundaries for their wedding. It's a tough call. But considering the sister's potential exclusion, maybe the author should have found another solution or had a discussion. So, possibly, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. The answer could be yes or no. Hmm.\n"
