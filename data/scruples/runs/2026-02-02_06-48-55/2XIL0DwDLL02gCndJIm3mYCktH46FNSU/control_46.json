I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for the sister's boyfriend at their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is a guy getting married, and he gave his sister a plus one initially because she had a previous boyfriend they liked. Now she's with a new guy that the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talks too much, mooches off her. The author decided to rescind the plus one, even though it's last minute, but managed to get a cousin as a replacement to avoid losing money. The sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed. The author believes the wedding should be intimate with only close family and friends.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and he has the right to set the guest list. If the boyfriend's behavior is problematic, it's reasonable to want to exclude him. Plus, the sister was given a plus one initially, but that was under different circumstances (when she had a different boyfriend). Now that the relationship has changed, the author might feel it's appropriate to adjust the guest list.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is upset because her boyfriend is being excluded, and she's threatening not to attend. The relationship is only six months old, which might be a factor in whether the family should accept him or not. But the author's main concern is the atmosphere of the wedding. If the boyfriend is disruptive, it could affect the event. The author also tried to find a replacement, so there's no financial loss, which is a responsible move.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Is it fair for the author to single out this boyfriend, especially since he's new? Could the sister have communicated the boyfriend's behavior earlier? But the author's reasoning is about the wedding's intimate setting and wanting everyone to get along. The author isn't excluding his sister; just her plus one. The sister's threat to leave if the boyfriend can't come might be seen as her being self-centered, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the wedding's environment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted reasonably. The author has a legitimate reason and made an effort to mitigate the problem. The sister is making it about herself, but the author's action seems justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
