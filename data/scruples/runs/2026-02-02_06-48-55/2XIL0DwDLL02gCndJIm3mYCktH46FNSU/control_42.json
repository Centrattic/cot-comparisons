I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding. The main points from the story are: the author gave the sister a plus one, which initially was for her ex-boyfriend. Now the sister has a new boyfriend that the author's family doesn't like. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a replacement (the cousin), but the sister is threatening to not attend if her boyfriend isn't there. The wedding is in an intimate setting, and the author wants everyone there to be enjoyable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and etiquette around weddings. Typically, guests are allowed to bring a plus one, and it's usually up to the host (the couple getting married) to set the guest list. So if the author is organizing the wedding, they have the right to decide the guest list. However, there's a family dynamic here\u2014the sister is a close relative, so there might be expectations of inclusion.\n\nThe key factors here are the timing and the reasons. The author mentions it's last minute, but they managed to replace the plus one without losing money. The boyfriend is described as unemployed, mooching, and talkative, which are personal judgments. The sister has only been with the boyfriend for six months, which is a short time, but maybe they have a right to bring someone they're in a relationship with.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about maintaining an intimate setting and wanting everyone to be enjoyable. That's a valid concern. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her autonomy in choosing who to bring is being respected. The question is whether the author overstepped by rescinding the plus one without discussing it with the sister first. \n\nIf the author had communicated their concerns with the sister and perhaps tried to find a compromise, it might have been handled better. But the act of rescinding the plus one without a prior agreement might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the sister is a family member. However, the author did find a replacement, so there's no financial loss, which could be a point in their favor.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's right to set the guest list is a valid point, but they might have approached the sister differently. The sister's reaction of threatening to not attend is also a strong move, which might indicate that the author's action was hurtful. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a unilateral decision that affected a family member, even if they had good intentions. But if the author had the authority to decide the guest list, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't consult the sister before rescinding the plus one. They might have had the right to decide the guest list, but the way it was handled could be seen as inconsiderate. The sister's reaction is also important\u2014threatening to leave the wedding is a big deal. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on their sister's feelings and the relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
