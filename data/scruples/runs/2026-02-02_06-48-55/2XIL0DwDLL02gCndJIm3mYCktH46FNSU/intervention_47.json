I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (27M) is getting married and initially gave his sister (24F) a plus one because they liked her previous boyfriend. After they broke up, the sister started dating a new guy, and the author and their immediate family don't like him. The guy is unemployed at 31, seems to mooch off the sister, and talks nonstop. The author decided to rescind the plus one, found a cousin to replace him to avoid financial loss, but the sister is threatening to not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weddings are personal events, and usually, the couple has the right to decide their guest list. The author's reasoning is that it's an intimate setting with close friends and family, and they want to enjoy everyone there. The sister's argument is that she wants her boyfriend to be there because they've only been dating six months. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial plus one was given when the sister was dating someone the author liked. The new boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is concerned about the event's atmosphere. The author tried to mitigate financial loss by finding a replacement, which is considerate. However, the sister is now threatening to not attend, which complicates things. \n\nI need to weigh the author's right to their wedding experience against the sister's feelings. The sister's threat to not come if the boyfriend isn't allowed could be seen as holding a gun to the author's head, especially since the wedding is already planned. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is a legitimate concern for the author. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the couple's authority over the wedding guest list is respected. The sister's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it with the sister first instead of rescinding it unilaterally. However, the author did try to find a replacement, so maybe they considered the financial aspect. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to a comfortable wedding, the sister's right to bring someone she's dating, and the potential for family conflict. The boyfriend's traits (unemployed, talkative) might be valid concerns for the author. But dating six months isn't a very long time, and relationships can be new. However, the sister should have considered her family's feelings before bringing someone who might be a problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable, the sister's threat might be inconsiderate. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are protecting their event's atmosphere. However, the sister's reaction could be seen as selfish. But the answer isn't entirely black and white. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after analysis, maybe the author isn't. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
