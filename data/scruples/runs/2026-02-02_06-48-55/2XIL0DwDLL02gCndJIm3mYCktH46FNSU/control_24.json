I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rescinding their sister's plus one to the wedding because they don't like the sister's new boyfriend. The author gave the sister a plus one initially because they liked her ex-boyfriend. Now the sister has a new guy who the family doesn't like\u2014unemployed, talks too much, mooches off her. The author decided to revoke the plus one, found a cousin to take the spot, and the sister is threatening to skip the wedding if her boyfriend isn't allowed.\n\nHmm. Weddings are personal events, so the author probably wants to keep it intimate. But rescinding the plus one is causing family tension. The sister has been given a plus one before, and now she's being denied. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for six months. The author is trying to prevent someone they don't like from attending, but the sister feels it's unfair. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to decide guests vs. the sister's right to bring someone. Since it's the author's wedding, they usually have the final say on guests. However, rescinding a plus one last-minute might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the sister was relying on attending with her partner. But the author did mention it's a destination wedding, which adds cost, and they found a replacement to avoid financial loss. \n\nBut the sister is threatening to not come at all. That's a big consequence. The author might be causing family conflict. However, the author has the right to set the guest list. The boyfriend's behavior is a concern for the author's comfort. The sister might need to find a compromise. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's their event, but maybe they should have had a better strategy to avoid this conflict. However, the answer options are A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made a decision based on their comfort and adjusted to avoid financial loss, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But some might argue they should have handled it differently. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's stance is about their own event.\n"
