I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.\n\nLo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.\n\nRegardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it\u2019s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they\u2019ve been going out for roughly 6 months).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that\u2019s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. \n\nTLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won\u2019t go if he\u2019s not included, they\u2019ve only been going out 6 months.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about rescinding a plus one for their sister's new boyfriend because the family doesn't like him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave their sister a plus one initially when she was with her ex, but after breaking up, they decided to see who she brings. Then the sister started dating someone new, and the author doesn't like him for several reasons: unemployed, mooching, and talkative. The author decided to rescind the plus one, got their cousin to take his place, and now the sister is threatening to not come to the wedding if the boyfriend isn't invited.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, weddings are personal events, and the host might want to ensure a pleasant atmosphere for everyone. The author wants an intimate setting with close friends and family, so excluding someone who might cause discomfort could make sense. On the other hand, rescinding a plus one so close to the wedding might seem harsh, especially if the sister feels the boyfriend is part of her life now. Also, the sister's threat to not attend could be a significant consequence.\n\nI should think about the timeline. The wedding is in April, and the post is a last-minute decision. The author mentioned getting a cousin to replace the plus one to avoid losing money, which shows they tried to mitigate costs. But the sister's reaction is strong. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to exclude someone based on personal dislike? The author's reasoning is that they want to enjoy the guests. However, they are making a judgment about the boyfriend based on their own opinions. The sister might feel that her choice of partner is being judged, which could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the sister has been in a relationship for six months. Depending on cultural norms or family traditions, bringing a partner to a wedding is common. The author might have set expectations by giving the plus one, and changing it now could be seen as unfair, even if the initial condition was to see who the sister would bring. \n\nAnother angle: the author's decision affects the sister's attendance. If the sister chooses not to come because of this, it could create a rift in the family. The author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the sister's relationship, which could be seen as self-centered. \n\nBut then again, the author is the one hosting the wedding and has the right to decide the guest list. If the boyfriend's presence is a source of conflict and could spoil the event for others, the author's decision might be justified. However, the way it's handled (last minute and without prior discussion) could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might depend on whether the author's reasons are valid enough to justify the exclusion. If the boyfriend's behavior is genuinely problematic (unemployed, mooching, talkative), the author might feel justified. However, the sister's perspective is also valid\u2014she might feel her choice is being dismissed. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to have a pleasant event, but the consequence is a strained relationship with their sister. The sister's threat to skip the wedding is a serious consequence. \n\nI think there's a middle ground here. The author could have had a conversation with the sister earlier to express concerns before making the final decision. Maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating better or for being too hasty. However, if the author genuinely believes the boyfriend's presence would ruin the event, that's another angle. \n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because excluding someone from a wedding is a significant decision, especially close to the event, and it's causing the sister to consider not attending. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's happiness, which might be perceived as the \"asshole\" move.\n"
