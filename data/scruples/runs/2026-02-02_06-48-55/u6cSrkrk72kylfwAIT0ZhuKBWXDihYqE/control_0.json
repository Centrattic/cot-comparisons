I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They've been together for over five years, and both want kids. The girlfriend suggests adoption or surrogacy, but the author doesn't want to go that route and is thinking about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is the author's stance on having biological children versus the girlfriend's openness to alternative methods. The author is conflicted between his desire for a biological child and the reality of his girlfriend's infertility. He loves her but can't reconcile his need for a biological child with the options available. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering breaking up because of this.\n\nI should consider the moral and ethical aspects. Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing. The girlfriend is offering solutions like adoption or surrogacy, which are valid options. However, the author feels that these options aren't for him, which is his personal choice. But by choosing to end the relationship, is he being selfish or insensitive? \n\nIt's important to note that the author is in a vulnerable position, dealing with the loss of a potential biological child. However, the girlfriend is also dealing with the emotional impact of infertility. The author's decision to break up might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship, especially when the girlfriend is offering alternatives. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. He's not pretending to be okay with adoption when he isn't. He's upfront about his limitations, which is a mature approach. However, the timing of breaking up after such news could be seen as heartless, as the girlfriend is likely already hurting from the infertility diagnosis. The breakup might add to her emotional burden.\n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. If both wanted kids, and there's a way to achieve that through adoption or surrogacy, is it fair for the author to walk away instead of exploring those options? The author might be avoiding the complexities of adoption, which can be challenging, but he's clear he doesn't want to pursue it. Meanwhile, the girlfriend is willing to consider these options despite her own pain.\n\nBut the author is not in the wrong if he's honest about his limitations. It's a personal choice, and relationships sometimes end because partners have incompatible values. However, the way he's framing it\u2014considering breaking up immediately after the news\u2014might be seen as using infertility as an excuse rather than a deal-breaker. If the issue was always about wanting biological children and the relationship couldn't adapt, maybe it's not his fault. But if they were okay with whatever it took to have kids and this is the reason to break up, then it's a problem.\n\nAlso, the author admits it sounds selfish, which he might be aware of. But is it selfish? Or is it realistic? He feels he can't adopt, so he can't be the one to walk away? But he's in a position where his needs can't be met within the relationship. The girlfriend's needs might also not be met if he leaves, but it's a mutual compromise.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author is not in the wrong if he's making a difficult decision based on his inability to compromise. However, the context of breaking up right after the infertility diagnosis might be seen as insensitive. The answer hinges on whether the decision is based on a deal-breaker that was known before or if it's an excuse to exit the relationship after facing a problem. Since the author mentions they were trying for a year and decided to check, it's implied they wanted biological kids together. Now that that's not possible, he's considering breaking up. That might be seen as prioritizing biological children over the relationship, which some would argue is his prerogative, but others might see as the asshole move.\n"
