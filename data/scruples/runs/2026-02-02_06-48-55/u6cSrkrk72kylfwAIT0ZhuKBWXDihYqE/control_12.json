I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, tried to conceive for a year, she's infertile. She suggests adoption or surrogacy. He doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate because he wants his own biological kids. He's thinking about breaking up because he can't see himself without having his own children. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, major life decisions like having kids are usually mutual agreements. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, and she can't provide that, it might be a deal-breaker. However, he acknowledges it's selfish. But it's also his personal desire. The question is whether wanting biological kids is a valid reason to break up, especially when the other partner is offering alternatives.\n\nHe hasn't made the decision yet, just considering. He's empathetic to her feelings, saying he doesn't want to break up during this hard time. But he can't reconcile his own needs. Is it fair to stay in a relationship where a core desire isn't met? Or is it selfish to prioritize his biological needs over her emotional state?\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. He's in a dilemma between his personal values and his love for her. But relationships require compromise. If he's unwilling to consider adoption or surrogacy, maybe he's not willing to adjust as much as he expects her to. However, if having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity, maybe it's a valid reason. \n\nThe community might split here. Some might say it's selfish to break up over infertility, especially when she's already offering solutions. Others might argue that if having a biological child is essential, then it's not fair to stay in a relationship that can't fulfill that. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact on her. She's going through a shock and grief, and he's considering leaving. It could be seen as abandoning her during a crisis. However, he's also struggling with his own needs. The balance of support vs. personal values is tricky.\n\nIn conclusion, there's no clear right or wrong here. But in terms of responsibility, if he's unwilling to explore all options and is only considering a breakup without fully engaging with her suggestions, he might be seen as in the wrong. But if his desire for biological children is a legitimate non-negotiable, then it's a difficult situation. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the selfishness aspect and the timing of the breakup during her vulnerability. However, others might argue it's B (not in the wrong) if having a biological child is a core value he can't compromise on. I need to check the nuances again. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are empathy, communication, and whether the decision is fair. Given he hasn't communicated his stance yet and is considering breaking up without fully exploring alternatives, I think the answer is A.\n"
