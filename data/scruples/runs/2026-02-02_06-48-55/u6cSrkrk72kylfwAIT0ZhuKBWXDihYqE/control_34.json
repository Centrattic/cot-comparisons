I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) question is in the wrong. The situation is that he's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They were planning to get married and have kids, but he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he wants his own biological child.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze his reasoning. The author hasn't made a decision yet but is considering breaking up. His girlfriend suggested adoption or a surrogate, but he's not open to those options. He feels it's selfish to ask her to go through adoption or surrogacy, and he wants a child that's biologically theirs. He's conflicted because he loves her but doesn't want to proceed without the possibility of having their own child.\n\nNow, considering societal perspectives. Some might argue that his desire for a biological child is valid and that it's okay to prioritize that in a relationship. Others might see it as selfish, especially since the infertility isn't the woman's fault, and he's placing the burden on her. The woman is already going through emotional distress, and if he breaks up, it adds more pain to her.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for five years and were about to get engaged suggests a long-term commitment. Breaking up over something that wasn't her fault could be seen as unfair. However, relationships are based on mutual goals. If having biological children is a deal-breaker for him, maybe he's being honest about his needs even though it's difficult.\n\nBut is it his fault? The question is whether he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, if he's making a decision based on his own values, even if it's painful, it's a personal choice. However, the way he's handling it might be inconsiderate. He needs to communicate clearly and support her, not just break up without considering her feelings. The key is whether he's being selfish or honest about his limitations.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often considers intent, communication, and fairness. If he's not being cruel but is truthful about his desires, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's using the infertility as an excuse to break up when he's not open to other options, that could be seen as wrong. The woman might have invested in the relationship expecting them to have kids, and he's now backing out because of her infertility, which is beyond her control.\n\nSo the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the relationship, especially when the infertility isn't her fault. However, some might argue that it's his right to choose. But in the WIBTA context, breaking up over something beyond her control could be seen as harsh and unfair, making him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
