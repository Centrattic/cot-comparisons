I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The answer needs to be either A or B, where A means the author is in the wrong, and B means not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, both young, and they were planning to get married. They tried to conceive for a year and found out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants biological children. He loves her but feels he can't change his stance.\n\nNow, the key points here are the reasons for considering the breakup. The author admits it might sound selfish. The question is whether prioritizing his desire for biological children makes him the asshole. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He's not forcing the relationship or pretending he's okay with alternatives. He's in a tough spot, loving her but not wanting to compromise on having a biological child. On the other hand, breaking up after five years over this could be seen as heartless, especially since the infertility is the woman's issue, not his. There's also the emotional toll on her, as she's already suggested alternatives, and he's not even considering them beyond saying it's a good idea. \n\nSociety often has varying views on this. Some might say wanting biological kids is natural, others might think it's selfish not to consider adoption or surrogacy, especially when he admits he's not thinking straight. Also, the fact that they were about to get engaged adds weight to the decision's impact. \n\nBut the author is in the process of thinking through this and hasn't made a decision yet. He's trying to be fair by seeking opinions. However, the core issue is whether his desire for biological children is a valid reason to end a long-term relationship when alternatives exist. \n\nI think the community's take might be that it's a complex situation. But in terms of being the asshole, if he follows through, he's prioritizing his own desires over her feelings and the relationship they've built, especially since he acknowledges she's more affected. So maybe A (he's in the wrong) because it's seen as selfish despite his honesty. However, some might argue B if they believe his feelings are valid. But given the context, the common response might lean towards A.\n"
