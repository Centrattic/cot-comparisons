I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The answer should be either A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years. They were trying to conceive for a year and found out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants biological children with his partner, and since that's not possible, he's contemplating ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings and his stated reasons. He mentions that he loves her and she's the love of his life, but his desire for biological children is causing him to consider a breakup. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethical perspectives. Having children is a personal choice, and it's valid for someone to desire biological children. However, the situation here is that the girlfriend is the one who can't conceive, and the author is walking away because of that. Is it fair? There's also the aspect of support during a difficult time. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, but the author isn't open to them. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author says he hasn't decided yet and is considering options. But the fact that he's leaning towards breaking up because he can't compromise might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him and he's clear about that, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, entering a long-term relationship typically involves some compromise. If the author had known beforehand that infertility might be an issue, would he still proceed with the engagement? \n\nAnother angle: the emotional impact. The girlfriend is already devastated by the news. The author is considering leaving her during this vulnerable time, which could be seen as cruel. Even if his reasons are personal, the timing and the way he's thinking about ending things might be hurtful. Also, the mention that she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e adds weight because this is a significant life decision where both parties' needs should be considered.\n\nThe author acknowledges that his thoughts might sound selfish. Society often judges people who prioritize their own needs in such situations without considering the partner's emotional state. However, it's also true that people have different values. Some people are not open to adoption or surrogacy, and that's their choice. But the question is whether using infertility as a reason to break up makes him the asshole.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. The author isn't doing something malicious; he just has a personal desire that can't be met. However, the fact that he's considering breaking up after she's already going through a hard time might make him the asshole. The support he's providing now might not be enough if he's actively thinking about leaving. It's about balancing personal needs with the well-being of the partner.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because walking away after a significant emotional blow, especially when the partner is trying to adjust by suggesting alternatives, could be seen as not fully committing to the relationship. Even if his reasons are personal, the way he's handling it might be hurtful and not considerate enough of his partner's feelings.\n"
