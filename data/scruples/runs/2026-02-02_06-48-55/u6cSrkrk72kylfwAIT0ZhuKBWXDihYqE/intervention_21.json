I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he and his girlfriend tried to have a baby for a year, got tested, found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants his own kids with her. The question is whether he's the asshole for even thinking about breaking up over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together five years, and he's 24, she's 26. They were planning to get married. He loves her a lot, but he's not open to alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. He feels like he wants \"his own kids,\" which he defines as having the woman he's with carry them. He's struggling with this because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he can't see past this issue.\n\nFrom his perspective, maybe he's being honest about his feelings. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's just considering his own limitations. But from her side, after finding out about her infertility, which is a huge emotional blow, he's considering leaving her because he doesn't want to adopt. That could seem selfish because he's focusing on his own desires without considering her feelings or the fact that she's already suggested alternatives. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. He mentions that they support each other, but he hasn't really discussed his feelings with her yet. He's still considering options, but the idea of breaking up is already there. If he hasn't talked to her about why he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, maybe he's making a decision based on his own unresolved feelings without considering her perspective.\n\nAlso, the fact that he says it's not easy for him to write this shows he's conflicted. But is his conflict enough to justify breaking up? Infertility can be a significant factor in relationships, and how each person handles it varies. However, walking away immediately might be seen as unfair, especially if he hasn't explored the situation fully with her. \n\nAnother angle is societal expectations. Some people might think wanting biological kids is normal, but others might see it as selfish not to consider adoption or surrogacy, especially when your partner is willing to explore those options. The author's stance that he can't adopt is his personal choice, but it's impacting his partner's future, which could be seen as self-centered.\n\nHe does acknowledge that his reasoning might sound selfish, and that's a good sign. It shows he's aware that his perspective isn't the only one. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering breaking up. If he's not communicating with her and is only thinking about his own needs, that's problematic. However, if he's being honest about his limitations and they can't find a middle ground, maybe it's not entirely his fault. Still, the act of considering a breakup right after such a traumatic event for her might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to consider breaking up without fully addressing his feelings with his girlfriend and without trying to understand her situation more deeply might make him the asshole. He's not wrong for having his own desires, but the way he's handling the situation could be inconsiderate. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not fully considering her feelings and the alternatives she's already suggested.\n"
