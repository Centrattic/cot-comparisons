I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be the Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile and he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. They had been planning to have a baby, and now he's thinking about ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, and they tried to conceive for a year before testing. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author doesn't want to consider adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't shake the feeling that he wants biological kids with her. He's conflicted between his love for her and his desire for a biological child.\n\nThe author is questioning if he's being selfish. The main issue here is whether his decision to break up because of infertility is justified. From a moral standpoint, breaking up over infertility could be seen as wrong because it's ending a relationship based on a biological factor that's beyond the woman's control. However, personal values and desires also play a role here. The author feels that adoption or surrogacy isn't for him, which is his personal choice.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of support. The girlfriend is going through a major emotional blow, and the author is considering leaving her during this time. That seems harsh. Even if he doesn't want adoption, he could explore other options together, like using donor sperm or other assisted reproductive technologies. However, the scenario states that the infertility is on the woman's side, so maybe those options aren't applicable here.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions that he hasn't decided yet and is considering all options. He did support her emotionally, but when she suggested adoption, he didn't engage deeply. He just agreed and left it at that. Maybe if he had more open discussions about why adoption isn't acceptable to him, they could find a middle ground. However, if his stance is firm and unyielding, that might contribute to the breakup.\n\nSociety often has varying views on this. Some might say that wanting biological children is valid, but others argue that love and commitment should outweigh such desires. The author is facing a conflict between his personal desires and his commitment to the relationship. The key question is whether his decision is a reasonable one given the circumstances.\n\nI should also consider the emotional impact on the girlfriend. She's already dealing with the infertility diagnosis, and a breakup from someone she loves could be devastating. The author's hesitation to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her now shows some consideration, but ultimately, if he's not willing to accept other options, the breakup might be inevitable for him. However, is that his fault? If the relationship's foundation included the desire for biological children and that's no longer possible, could that be a reason to leave?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice, and the woman shouldn't be penalized for it. The author's unwillingness to adapt to the situation could be seen as selfish. However, if the couple had different expectations from the start, that's another matter. The scenario doesn't mention if they had discussed fertility issues before, but they had been trying for a year, so maybe they assumed they could have kids naturally.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal choice based on his values, but the decision to break up because of infertility might be viewed as wrong by others who prioritize the relationship over personal biological wishes. The answer depends on whether one's personal desires outweigh the commitment to a partner who is facing a medical challenge beyond their control.\n"
