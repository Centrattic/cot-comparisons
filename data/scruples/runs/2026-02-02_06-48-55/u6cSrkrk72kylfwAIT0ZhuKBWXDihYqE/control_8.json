I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA scenario is wrong for considering breaking up because his girlfriend is infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together five years, planning to have kids. They found out she's infertile, and he's not open to adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but can't imagine moving forward without the possibility of biological kids.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether his feelings make him an asshole. On one hand, he's being honest about his desires, which is important in a relationship. But on the other, breaking up over infertility could be seen as putting his needs above hers, especially since she's already going through a tough time. \n\nInfertility is a medical condition, not a choice. The fact that he's considering breaking up because of it might be viewed as selfish. However, people have different values about having biological children. If they had discussed this before, maybe he's justified. But the scenario doesn't mention prior discussion, so maybe this is a dealbreaker he hadn't considered. \n\nAlso, he mentions he's not thinking straight, which complicates things. It's possible he's reacting impulsively. The girlfriend is devastated, and he's considering leaving just as she needs support. That could be seen as insensitive. \n\nBut he's also honest about his feelings. If they can't compromise, maybe it's better to part ways. However, the key is whether his reasoning is valid. If he's unwilling to consider alternatives she's open to, that's where the conflict lies. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say it's unfair to end a long-term relationship because of a medical issue beyond her control. Others might empathize with his desire for biological children. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: breaking up over something beyond her control, without prior discussion, and during her vulnerable time could make him wrong (A). But if personal values are non-negotiable, then it's not his fault (B). The answer hinges on whether his reaction is justified given the circumstances.\n"
