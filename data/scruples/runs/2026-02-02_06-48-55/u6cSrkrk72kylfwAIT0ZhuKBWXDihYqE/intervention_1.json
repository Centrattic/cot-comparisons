I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend found out she's infertile. They had been trying for a baby for a year. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and he wants to have his own biological children. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, and he didn't really engage beyond saying it's a good idea. He's not considering those options at all. He wants biological kids, and since she can't have them, he's thinking of breaking up. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nIs it wrong to break up over this? Well, maybe. Relationships often involve compromise. If he's not willing to consider alternatives, maybe that's where the problem lies. But on the other hand, having his own biological children might be a deeply held personal value. It's a sensitive issue because he's acknowledging her needs and supporting her, but his own needs are leading him to consider ending the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author is young (24) and his girlfriend is 26. They had planned to get married. The fact that he's considering breaking up after a big life event like this is significant. Society might have different views on whether biological children are essential. Some might see his stance as selfish, not considering her feelings or other options. Others might see it as being honest about his values.\n\nThe key here is whether he's being selfish or realistic. If he's not open to any alternatives, maybe he's not showing enough flexibility. But if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then perhaps it's a valid reason. However, breaking up immediately after the diagnosis without exploring options together might be hasty. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering the breakup. If he's making a decision based on a personal value but not considering her perspective fully, maybe he is. But it's also a personal choice. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified. The author's reasoning is that he can't adopt, which is his choice, but ending the relationship because he can't compromise might be seen as wrong. So maybe A (yes, he's in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
