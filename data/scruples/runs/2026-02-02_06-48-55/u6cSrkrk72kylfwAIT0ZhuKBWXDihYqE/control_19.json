I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up after finding out his girlfriend is infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. He's struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy and is considering breaking up because he wants biological kids with her. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether his feelings and potential decision make him the asshole. The writer is in emotional turmoil and is conflicted between love and his desire for biological children. He acknowledges it might sound selfish but feels it's genuine.\n\nI should consider cultural and moral perspectives. In many societies, the desire for biological children is significant, but so is the importance of supporting a partner through hardships. Breaking up after a long-term relationship over this could be seen as heartless, especially if he's been there for her during the news. However, personal preferences and values can vary. If having a child is a non-negotiable for him, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut here's the catch: he hasn't communicated his stance clearly. He mentioned he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy but didn't explain it to her. Maybe she thought they could work around it. His consideration of breaking up without discussing it could hurt her more. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being honest about his feelings, maybe not, but the key is how he handles it. However, given that they were planning to marry, wanting to leave after a major life event like this could be seen as selfish. Also, the fact that he's the one who might not be open to alternatives could place more pressure on her to adjust, which might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, he's struggling with his own desires and the reality of the situation. It's a tough spot. But in terms of responsibility, if he's not willing to compromise, he might be the one causing the breakup. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his biological child wish over the existing relationship, especially without fully discussing alternatives with his partner. The answer could be A. But I need to be careful here. The community might have mixed reactions, but the writer is likely the asshole for not considering the emotional impact and not being open to alternatives that his girlfriend suggested.\n"
