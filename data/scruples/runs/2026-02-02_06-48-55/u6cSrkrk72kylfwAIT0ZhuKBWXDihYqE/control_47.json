I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is wrong for considering breaking up because his girlfriend is infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The couple has been together over five years, both in their early 20s. They wanted kids and tried for a year, then found out she's infertile. He's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants biological kids. He loves her but feels he can't compromise here.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Values vary, but in relationships, especially long-term ones, compromise is key. The man is prioritizing his desire for biological children over the relationship. But the woman has already suggested alternatives. If he's not open to those, it's a deal-breaker for him. However, ending the relationship after five years because of infertility could be seen as selfish, especially if she's not ready to let go and he's the one choosing to leave. \n\nSociety often criticizes people who prioritize their own needs over a partner's, especially in such emotional contexts. The man is acknowledging it might sound selfish. But he's also honest about his feelings. The woman might feel abandoned, so he's weighing his needs against hers. \n\nHowever, if the man is firm in his stance and the woman is willing to explore alternatives he's not considering, it's a conflict. But he's not wrong for having his own values. Yet, choosing to break up immediately after such news, when they were close to engagement, might seem harsh. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether values about biological children are acceptable in a relationship. If it's a non-negotiable for him and he's clear, maybe not the asshole. But given the emotional impact on her, some might argue he should stay and support her instead of leaving over something they can't control. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because it's a sensitive situation and ending the relationship for a reason beyond both their control might be seen as abandoning her during a tough time. Plus, he's the one with the non-negotiable stance here.\n"
