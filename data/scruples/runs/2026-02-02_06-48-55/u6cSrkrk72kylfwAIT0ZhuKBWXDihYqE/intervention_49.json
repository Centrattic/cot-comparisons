I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants biological kids, doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and is conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key factors here. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. The main issue is infertility leading to a potential breakup. The author is struggling with his desire for biological children and his love for his girlfriend. He's considering breaking up because he can't accept alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which his girlfriend has suggested.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and emotional aspects. Infertility is a significant medical condition that can affect relationships. The girlfriend is already offering alternatives, showing she's trying to work through the problem. The author's reluctance to consider these options might be seen as prioritizing his own desire for biological children over her feelings and their existing relationship. However, it's also valid that some people have strong preferences for biological children and may not be able to adjust their stance.\n\nIs the author selfish? Maybe, but it's a personal value. However, walking away immediately after a major life event like this could be seen as insensitive, especially since the girlfriend is likely in a vulnerable state. The timing of the breakup might be seen as inconsiderate, even if his feelings are genuine. The author is also acknowledging that his reasons might sound selfish, which suggests he's aware of the potential for being seen as the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's values are non-negotiable and he's honest with his girlfriend, maybe it's fair to part ways. But the key here is whether he's giving her enough time to process and whether he's being fair in his decision. The question is whether breaking up under these circumstances is wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many people might find it harsh to break up over infertility, especially when the other partner is offering solutions. However, others might argue that personal values are important and that staying in a relationship without the possibility of having biological kids might lead to future resentment.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the author might be in the wrong because he's considering a breakup based on a medical condition that was beyond the girlfriend's control, and he's not fully considering her efforts to find alternatives. His immediate reaction could be seen as not supporting her during a tough time. But it's a complex situation where both perspectives have validity. However, given the emotional impact on the girlfriend and the fact that she's trying to adapt, the author's decision could be seen as selfish and thus, him being the asshole.\n"
