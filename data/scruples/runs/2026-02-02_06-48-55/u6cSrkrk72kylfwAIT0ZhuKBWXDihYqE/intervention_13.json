I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The main points here are the reasons for the breakup and the context of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over five years and were planning to get married. They wanted to have kids, tried for a year, and found out she's infertile. The guy is struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy, insisting he wants his own biological child. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The man is being honest about his feelings, which is important. But is it fair to break up over this? On one hand, wanting to have biological children is a personal choice. On the other hand, walking away after five years because of infertility might be seen as selfish, especially since he acknowledges it's a big blow for his girlfriend. \n\nThe key factors are:\n1. The length of the relationship and commitment.\n2. The emotional impact on his girlfriend.\n3. Whether he's given sufficient thought to alternatives like surrogacy or adoption.\n4. Whether his decision is selfish or based on genuine incompatibility.\n\nHe did say he's supportive and they're dealing with the news together. However, his main issue is not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate, which are valid options. But if he's not open to those solutions, then the issue is about his own desires conflicting with her ability. \n\nInfertility is a medical condition, not a flaw. The man is prioritizing his biological child over the relationship, which might be seen as using her condition as a reason to leave. Also, he's the one who initially suggested checking for infertility, so he was aware of the possibility. \n\nIn many perspectives, it's the man's choice to prioritize biological children, which might not be the woman's fault. However, breaking up after such a long time and at a vulnerable moment could be seen as harsh. He's also the one who was about to propose, indicating he was committed before the fertility issue. \n\nThe question is whether his decision is inconsiderate. He's been supportive, but the breakup is based on his own limitations rather than her actions. It's a personal choice, but in terms of fairness, some might argue he's not in the wrong because it's his personal values. Others might think it's wrong to end a long-term relationship because of this, especially when alternatives exist. \n\nBut the woman is the one who suggested alternatives, and he rejected them. So he's choosing his own preferences over the relationship. The fact that he's been there for her but is still considering breaking up because of his own desires might tip the scales in terms of being inconsiderate.\n"
