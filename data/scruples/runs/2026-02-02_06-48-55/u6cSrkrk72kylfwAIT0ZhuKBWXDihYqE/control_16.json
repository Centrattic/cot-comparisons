I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy. The key question is whether breaking up over this is the wrong thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The couple has been together five years, really wanted kids, and now there's a barrier. The author loves his girlfriend but can't accept alternatives. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, which he didn't want. He's thinking of breaking up to avoid making her go through a breakup after the shock, but he's conflicted because he loves her.\n\nIs the author selfish? He's honest about his desire for biological kids and his inability to adopt. But ending a long-term relationship over this could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her well-being. On the other hand, staying in a relationship where both can't have the kids they wanted might lead to future resentment. \n\nThe girlfriend is clearly hurt, and the author acknowledges that. He's trying to be supportive but is struggling with his own feelings. The question is whether his decision to break up is the \"wrong\" thing. Some might argue that he's being realistic and honest about his needs, while others might say he's abandoning her when she needs support. \n\nIn WIBTA threads, people often look for community judgment. Common opinions might be that wanting to have biological children is valid, but breaking up immediately could be seen as not giving enough time to work through the issue. Also, the fact that the girlfriend suggested alternatives shows she's trying to find solutions, and the author dismissing those without deeper discussion might be a problem. \n\nHowever, if the author truly can't consider adoption or surrogacy, then staying might lead to long-term unhappiness. But breaking up right after the diagnosis might be seen as hasty. The author is in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. The community might split, but the majority might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because it's a significant life event and breaking up quickly could be seen as insensitive, especially if he's not fully committed to exploring all options. But there's also a case for B if he's being honest about his limits. However, the way he's framing it as \"I can't change that\" and not engaging further with her solutions might tip the balance towards A.\n"
