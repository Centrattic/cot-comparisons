I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They mention they've been trying for a baby for a year, both got tested, and she's infertile. They've been together over five years. The guy is 24, she's 26. He says he wants his own biological kids, doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He's thinking of breaking up because he can't see moving forward without having their own child. He loves her but feels he can't adopt, and he's conflicted about breaking up after she's just been through this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his reasoning is valid. The key points here are his desire for biological children and his unwillingness to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether that makes him the asshole for considering a breakup.\n\nBiological child preference is a personal choice. Some people place a high value on having children that are genetically related to them, while others are happy with adoption. The fact that he's being honest with himself and his partner about his feelings is important. However, the timing and manner of considering a breakup might be problematic. \n\nHe acknowledges that his girlfriend is devastated and needs support. If he breaks up now, it might add to her emotional pain. But he's also considering his own needs. The ethical part here is whether it's fair to stay in a relationship if one partner can't compromise on a fundamental issue. If he truly can't consider alternatives, maybe breaking up to avoid a future conflict is better. On the other hand, abandoning her right after the diagnosis might seem heartless.\n\nThe community's perspective might vary. Some might say that wanting biological kids is a personal choice and not his fault. Others might argue that it's selfish to end the relationship because of infertility, especially if he didn't know his own fertility status beforehand. However, he mentions that they both got tested, so it's possible that he's aware of his own fertility. But the issue is her inability to carry. \n\nHe also says he's not decided yet, just considering options. The question is whether he's wrong for thinking this. Since he's being honest about his feelings and not making the decision yet, maybe it's not his fault. But if he does break up, that's when the judgment might come. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering it.\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) format, people often look at intentions and the impact. His intention is to be truthful about his desires but is also conflicted about hurting her. He's trying to support her but is struggling with his own needs. \n\nI think the answer here is that he's not necessarily in the wrong for having these thoughts, as it's his personal choice. However, the way he handles the situation matters. If he breaks up, some might think he's wrong, but the act of thinking it through isn't necessarily asshole behavior. So the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
