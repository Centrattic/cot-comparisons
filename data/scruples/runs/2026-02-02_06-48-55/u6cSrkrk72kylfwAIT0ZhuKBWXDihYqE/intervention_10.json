I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The author mentions that they had been trying for a baby for a year and now he's conflicted about continuing the relationship if they can't have biological children.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for 5 years, and both wanted kids. The girlfriend is infertile, which is a big deal for them. The author loves her but doesn't want to pursue adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids with her, but she can't provide that. He's torn between staying for her support and ending the relationship because he can't compromise on wanting his own biological children.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. Let's break down the key points. The author is struggling with his own feelings versus his partner's needs. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and he's supportive, but his personal desire for biological children is making him consider a breakup. Is it right or wrong for him to prioritize his biological child wish over the relationship?\n\nFrom one perspective, having a shared desire for children is a significant part of a relationship for many people. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then maybe it's not fair to continue a relationship where that's impossible. However, the author's stance could be seen as dismissive of his partner's feelings and the emotional impact of the infertility. Breaking up during her most vulnerable time might be considered selfish or insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, if his desire for biological children is a core value he can't compromise on, some might argue it's not necessarily the wrong to end the relationship if he realizes they can't meet that shared goal. However, the way he's handling it\u2014considering breaking up during her time of need\u2014could be problematic. The question is whether his decision is based on a genuine incompatibility or if he's avoiding compromise.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The author hasn't decided yet but is contemplating breaking up immediately after the diagnosis. This could be seen as impulsive or not giving enough time to process emotions and explore alternatives. The girlfriend has already suggested adoption and surrogacy, which he dismissed. His lack of openness to alternatives might indicate a lack of willingness to work through the issue together, which is a red flag in a long-term relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about not wanting to \"put her through a breakup after this news\" shows some consideration for her feelings, but his main motivation is his own inability to accept adoption. This self-centered perspective might be the reason he's in the wrong. The fact that he's been there for her shows support, but his ultimate decision hinges on his own desires, which could be seen as prioritizing his needs over her well-being, especially during a difficult time.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some people might argue that wanting biological children is a valid personal preference, and it's not the wrong to end a relationship if that expectation isn't met. However, others might see it as a failure to prioritize the partner's feelings and the existing relationship's value over a specific desire. The key here is whether the author is treating this issue as a deal-breaker from the start or if he's being realistic about his own limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he's handling the situation\u2014potentially breaking up during her most vulnerable time and without exploring alternatives\u2014could make him the asshole. His decision not to consider adoption or surrogacy, despite her suggestions, shows a lack of flexibility. The timing and the abrupt consideration of a breakup might be where he's in the wrong.\n"
