I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Terrible Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants to have biological children with her, which isn't possible, so he's thinking of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried for a baby for a year and got tested. The girlfriend is infertile. The author says he supports her but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels it's important to have a biological child with her. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't get past the infertility.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, especially long-term ones, dealing with infertility can be a major issue. The author is honest about his feelings, which is important. However, breaking up based on infertility could be seen as selfish, especially when the other person is already devastated. The girlfriend suggested adoption and surrogacy, which he dismissed without engaging more deeply. That might show a lack of willingness to compromise.\n\nBut on the other hand, personal values and desires about having children are valid. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, then it's a legitimate reason to question the future of the relationship. However, the way he's considering breaking up right after the diagnosis, without exploring all options together, might be seen as hasty or insensitive. He mentions he wants to support her but also that he can't shake the feeling that they can't have kids. It's a tough balance between personal desires and partner's feelings.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might argue that he's being inconsiderate, especially to a partner who is already going through a tough time. Others might say that everyone has the right to their own family-building preferences and that it's okay if they can't agree on a solution. The key here is whether he's being fair in considering his partner's needs and if he's given enough time to process the situation and explore alternatives. Since he hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice, maybe there's still room for growth in the relationship. But the act of breaking up based on infertility alone, without making a real effort to find a middle ground, might be seen as the wrong move. So leaning towards answer A, he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own unchangeable desires over his partner's well-being and the relationship they've built, without fully committing to alternative solutions she's proposed.\n"
