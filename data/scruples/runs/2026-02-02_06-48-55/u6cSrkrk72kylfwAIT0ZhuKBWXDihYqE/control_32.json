I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, both are in their mid-20s, and they were planning to have kids. They found out she's infertile, which is a big deal for them. The man is conflicted because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He feels that having a biological child is important, and this is making him consider breaking up even though he loves her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the woman is already dealing with the emotional trauma of infertility. The man is considering leaving her because of a preference for a biological child. That could be seen as selfish because it's adding to her pain. Adoption and surrogacy are alternatives, but he's not open to them. \n\nOn the other hand, personal values and desires matter. If the man's dream is to have a biological child and he can't compromise, he might feel it's honest to break up now rather than later. But is that his right? Relationships require mutual compromise. If they were okay with adoption or surrogacy, that could work, but since he's not open to those options, maybe it's a dealbreaker for him. However, is it fair to end the relationship over this when she's already hurting? \n\nAnother angle: The man hasn't decided yet. He's exploring options. The question is if he's wrong for considering it. Society often has varied views on this. Some might say that wanting a biological child isn't his fault, others might argue that his stance is inflexible and not supportive of his partner's situation. \n\nAlso, the woman might not have asked for the breakup. She might still want to try other methods or adjust their plans. Leaving her when she's vulnerable could be seen as callous. The man's reasoning is that he can't imagine adopting, but maybe with time and discussion, he could adjust. However, if he's certain he can't consider those options, then maybe it's a legitimate reason. \n\nBut the key point is that he's thinking about breaking up right after the news, which could be seen as adding emotional stress to her. Even if he loves her, ending the relationship at this time might be selfish. So, putting it all together, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because he's prioritizing his biological child wants over his partner's emotional state and the relationship they've built. However, others might argue that he's being honest about his non-negotiables. \n\nBut considering the circumstances, the answer is likely A, as it's seen as selfish to consider breaking up over something that could be addressed with alternatives, especially when the partner is already dealing with the shock of infertility.\n"
