I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend wanted to have kids, but she's infertile. They considered adoption or surrogacy, but he doesn't want to go that route. He loves her but is thinking about breaking up because he wants his own biological children. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for over five years and were planning to get engaged. The main issue is his desire for biological children. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't accept alternatives. \n\nIs it selfish to want biological kids? That's a personal value. Some people prioritize that, others don't. But the problem here is that he's considering breaking up because of this, which could hurt her deeply, especially since she's facing infertility. \n\nHe mentions that he's not decided yet, just considering options. However, the question is whether breaking up because of infertility makes him the asshole. \n\nInfertility is a medical condition, not a choice. The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, showing her willingness to adapt. The author, on the other hand, is not open to those solutions. This could mean he's not considering her feelings or efforts to find a way forward. \n\nAlso, he says he doesn't want to put her through a breakup right now because she needs him. That's a good point\u2014it shows he's aware of her vulnerability. But if he breaks up because of his own needs, it might be seen as prioritizing his desires over her emotional state. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. He should have discussed his feelings more openly before making a decision. If he hasn't fully explored their options together, maybe the issue is about not collaborating on solutions. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions like having kids are usually mutual. If one partner can't compromise on this, it's a significant problem. But is that enough to justify a breakup? It's a personal choice, but the timing and how it's handled matters. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is making a choice based on his preferences, which may not be fair to his girlfriend. Infertility isn't her fault, and his reaction might be seen as unfair. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
