I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have his own biological kids with her, which isn't possible now. The question is if he's wrong for thinking about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, they were planning to get married, and this is a major life decision. The main issue is whether wanting to have a biological child together is a valid reason to break up when that's no longer an option. \n\nOn one hand, the guy is being honest about his desires. He's saying he wants biological kids, can't consider adoption or surrogacy, and is struggling with the idea of moving forward without that. He's also acknowledging that his feelings might sound selfish. On the other hand, breaking up after such a long relationship, especially after she's already suggested alternatives, could be seen as hurting her at a vulnerable time. \n\nInfertility is a tough issue for many couples. The fact that they were trying for a year before testing shows they were committed to having a child together. Now that they can't, he's considering ending the relationship because it's not aligned with his desires. But is that wrong? Well, relationships require compromise. If he's not willing to compromise on having a biological child, maybe the relationship can't continue. However, breaking up because of this choice might be seen as prioritizing his own biological needs over the relationship itself. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is likely dealing with a lot of emotional pain from the infertility diagnosis. The guy says he's been supportive, but the thought of breaking up during this time could add to her distress. The question is whether he's being selfish by not considering adoption or surrogacy, which are options she's willing to explore. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that wanting biological children is not inherently selfish, especially if it's a core value. Others might say that being unwilling to explore all options, especially when the partner is open to them, is selfish. The guy's reasoning is that he can't adopt or use a surrogate, so he can't move forward. But if the relationship is otherwise strong, maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is based on a reasonable compromise or is an overreaction. Since he hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice, it's a situation where the morality is subjective. However, in many cases, people might consider that if he's not open to any alternatives, then he might be prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. But if having biological children is non-negotiable for him, it's also a valid reason to end the relationship, even if it's painful. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he breaks up, some might say yes because he's causing additional pain during a hard time. Others might say no because it's his right to make decisions about his own life and family. The answer would depend on the perspective taken. However, in the context of a long-term relationship where both partners were aligned in wanting kids together, maybe the author is making a choice based on his personal values, which could be seen as not wrong, but some might argue it's still selfish.\n"
