I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend. They had been trying to have a baby for about a year and decided to check both of their fertility. The result is that the girlfriend is infertile. The author mentions he hasn't decided yet but is considering breaking up because he wants to have biological children with her and is not open to adoption or surrogacy. He feels selfish but can't change his feelings. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The couple had been planning for a family, which is a big part of their relationship. The discovery of infertility is a significant shock. The author's main issue is his inability to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. He wants a biological child with his partner, but since that's not possible, he's contemplating breaking up.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze: Is it wrong to end a long-term relationship based on this? Let's think about expectations in relationships. When couples plan for kids, they often assume they'll have biological children. However, infertility can affect either partner. The author's problem is that he can't accept alternatives, which is a personal value. The girlfriend has suggested adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author, however, is not willing to consider those options, which leaves him with a decision about the relationship.\n\nIs wanting biological children a valid reason to end a relationship? It's a personal choice, but the author is the one who refuses alternatives. The girlfriend is open to solutions, but he isn't. That could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his desire for biological children over her feelings and their existing relationship. However, having children is a major life decision, and different people have different priorities. If the author can't compromise, maybe that's his right, but the timing and sensitivity matter here. The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility, and breaking up might be seen as adding to her distress.\n\nAlso, the question is whether he is the asshole. The author admits he might sound selfish, which is a clue. The girlfriend is supportive, and he's considering breaking up after such a difficult time for her. That could be cruel. However, if the author genuinely can't compromise, it's a personal decision. But the way he's framing it as an ultimatum might be unfair, especially since she's already trying to adjust.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that the author is being too rigid, while others might respect his honesty. The key is whether the author is acting inconsiderate. The fact that he's in love but considering breaking up because of this could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the inability to have biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then it's a matter of personal values. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. The answer might depend on the cultural context, but in many perspectives, choosing to leave someone after a traumatic event like infertility might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the other partner is open to alternatives.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires over the emotional needs of his partner, especially after she's already been through a lot. However, it's also about personal values and whether having biological children is a core value for him. The answer isn't black and white, but given the scenario, the author's decision to break up might be seen as selfish and cruel, making him the asshole.\n"
