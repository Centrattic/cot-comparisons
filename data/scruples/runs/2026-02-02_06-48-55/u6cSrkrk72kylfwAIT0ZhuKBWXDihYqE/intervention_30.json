I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she's found to be infertile. The author is 24, they've been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. The main issue is that the author wants biological children but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. So he's thinking about breaking up because they can't have kids naturally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author loves his girlfriend and says she's the love of his life. They were trying for a baby for a year before testing. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author isn't open to those options. He feels that he can't adopt and wants his own kids. He's not sure if his reasoning is selfish but feels that way.\n\nThe key points here are about values and what each person considers essential in a relationship. Infertility is a significant issue for some couples, and it's a personal decision. The author is in a tough spot because he wants biological children but doesn't want alternatives. However, his girlfriend is infertile, so they can't have kids the natural way. \n\nNow, the question is whether breaking up over this makes him the asshole. On one hand, he's being honest about his needs and not wanting to compromise. On the other, it might seem selfish to end the relationship because of something beyond her control. The girlfriend might feel rejected, as the issue isn't her fault. It's important to consider whether the author is prioritizing his own desires without considering her feelings and the relationship they've built.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions supporting each other and being there for her, which is positive. But if he's not open to any alternatives, even though she suggested them, that could be seen as not being flexible. However, he did say adoption is a good idea but doesn't want it. It's a personal choice, but the problem is whether it's fair to end the relationship over this.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say that wanting to have a biological child is valid, and others might argue that it's selfish to leave a partner over something they can't help. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and individual values. However, in many cases, people are expected to be open to alternatives if they're in love and want to stay together.\n\nThe author is conflicted but hasn't made a decision yet. He's seeking validation on whether he's the asshole. From a moral standpoint, using infertility as a reason to break up could be seen as wrong because it's not her fault. However, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, he might feel it's necessary. But the question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's understandable that he values biological children, the decision to break up solely because of her infertility might be considered selfish. The author is in the wrong because he's ending the relationship over an issue that isn't her fault and not considering her efforts to adapt. So the answer would be A.\n"
