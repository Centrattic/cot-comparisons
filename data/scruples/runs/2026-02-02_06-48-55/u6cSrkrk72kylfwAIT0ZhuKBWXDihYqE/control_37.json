I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The guy is in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they were trying to have a baby. They went through testing, and she's infertile. The guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but says he can't imagine being a parent without it being a biological child from her. The question is if he's the asshole for thinking about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The couple had been planning to have kids together. The inability to conceive naturally is a significant issue for the guy. He's not opposed to alternative methods like adoption or surrogacy, but he doesn't want to do either. His reasoning is that he wants \"his own kids\" with her, implying biological children. The problem is that she can't have them naturally, so he's considering breaking up because he can't compromise on that point.\n\nNow, societal views on this might vary. Some people might think that wanting biological children is selfish, especially if the partner is willing to explore other options. Others might say that the guy has a valid point if having biological children is non-negotiable for him. However, the key here is whether his decision to potentially break up is unfair given the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend is described as being devastated, and the guy acknowledges that she needs him. He's trying to be supportive but feels conflicted. The ethical issue here is about whether his stance is selfish. If he's willing to walk away because he can't compromise on having biological children, even though she's offering alternatives he rejects, that could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity and future plans, he might feel that he can't go through with a marriage that doesn't meet that need.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The guy says he told her adoption was a good idea but didn't elaborate. Maybe he didn't communicate his true feelings about not wanting adoption. If he didn't come clean about his stance until after the test results, that could be a problem. Open communication is essential in relationships, especially when discussing future plans like having children.\n\nAlso, the timing of the decision. They were about to get engaged, which is a major commitment. Making such a big decision after a significant life event like infertility diagnosis might be stressful. But is it fair to break up over this? If the guy had known about his stance on adoption and surrogacy before the diagnosis, maybe they could have addressed it earlier. Since they didn't, it's a new issue that's arising now.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the guy is being unrealistic. Infertility is a common issue, and many couples use adoption or surrogacy successfully. If he's unwilling to consider those options, even though they are viable, he might be prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. Others might argue that it's his right to have a say in how his children are conceived, especially if it's a core value for him.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's breaking up because he can't accept the situation, even though she's willing to adjust, that could be seen as selfish. But if he's honest about his needs from the start, maybe it's a mutual decision. The problem here is that he didn't communicate his stance on adoption/surrogacy before the test, so now he's in a position where he's considering breaking up after the fact. That might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since she's already offered solutions he's dismissing.\n\nIn summary, the guy is in a tough spot. His needs versus her willingness to adapt. If he's breaking up because he can't accept her infertility despite her offers to try other methods, he might be in the wrong. But if it's a matter of personal values and he's not willing to compromise, others might see it as his choice. The answer likely depends on whether his decision is seen as selfish or a reasonable stand based on his personal desires.\n"
