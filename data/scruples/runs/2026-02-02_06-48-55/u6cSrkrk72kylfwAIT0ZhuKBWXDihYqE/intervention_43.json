I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The key points here are about the author's reasons and the broader implications.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, planning for a family. She's infertile, and he doesn't consider adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological kids with her, but she can't. Now he's thinking of breaking up because he wants his own children, which they can't have through her. He says he loves her and that she's the love of his life, but he can't imagine adopting. \n\nSo, the question is whether breaking up over this is wrong. On one hand, some might see it as selfish because he's prioritizing his desire for biological kids over their relationship. Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice, and he's choosing to end the relationship rather than finding alternative paths to parenthood. That could be seen as unfair to her, especially since she's already suggested adoption or surrogacy. His rejection of those options might seem dismissive of her suggestions and his unwillingness to compromise could be considered a lack of support during a tough time.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his feelings and not pretending to be okay with alternatives. He's struggling with emotional and ethical issues around adoption. It's not easy for him, and he's trying to be truthful about his limitations. Some might argue that people have the right to want biological children and that it's not his fault he has these desires.\n\nBut considering the context, breaking up after a major life event like this could be seen as using infertility as a reason to leave, especially if he hadn't considered alternatives. The fact that he says he loves her but can't move past this might indicate that his commitment isn't there when faced with a challenge. Also, the timing of the breakup after she's already received such news could add emotional harm.\n\nThe ethical angle is about whether it's fair to end a long-term relationship over something that's beyond her control. The author's decision could be seen as prioritizing personal desires over the relationship, which might be viewed as inconsiderate. However, if he truly can't adapt his desires, it's a personal struggle. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values around family planning.\n\nIn summary, while the author's honesty might be commendable, the decision to break up over infertility without being open to alternatives could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given the emotional impact on his girlfriend. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
