I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years. They wanted kids and tried for a year, then tested. The girlfriend is infertile. The guy loves her but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He's thinking about breaking up because he wants biological kids. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't imagine moving forward without having their own child. The question is whether he's an asshole for considering this.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide between those. \n\nBiological kids are important to the author. His girlfriend might be devastated, but he's honest about his feelings. However, breaking up over this could be seen as selfish, especially since the infertility isn't his fault. On the other hand, he's being upfront and considering the future. \n\nIn relationships, values and goals matter. If having biological children is a dealbreaker, then maybe it's not his fault. But relationships also require compromise. He's not willing to consider alternatives, which could be a problem. Also, the emotional impact on his girlfriend is significant. \n\nSome people might say it's his right to have his own family as he wants, while others might think he's being too rigid. The key is whether his decision is fair considering the circumstances. Since he's still processing and hasn't decided yet, maybe he's trying to do the right thing. \n\nBut the question is about him being in the wrong. If he breaks up, it could be seen as prioritizing his desires over her feelings. However, if he stays, he might not be truly committed if he can't accept her limitations. \n\nI think this is a tough call. Different people have different views on this. Some might side with him because his values are important, while others might think he's being selfish. Given that he's trying to be honest and supportive, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A because breaking up over infertility could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut the key is that the author is not making a decision yet, just considering. So maybe the act of considering isn't wrong. However, if he does break up, it's more of an issue. Since the question is about being in the wrong in the situation as described, and he hasn't broken up yet, perhaps it's not his fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's being honest about his feelings and considering his future. But some might argue A. But in WIBTA scenarios, they often consider intent and actions. Since he's in the process of thinking and hasn't acted, and he's trying to be supportive, maybe B is correct.\n"
