I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nHe mentions they've been together for over five years and were planning to get married. They tried to conceive for a year and then found out she's infertile. He's really sad and supportive, but he can't get over the fact that they can't have their own biological child. He's considering breaking up because he wants to have kids with her, but he's not open to adoption or surrogacy. He feels selfish for thinking that way but can't change his feelings. The question is whether he's in the wrong for even considering this breakup.\n\nFirst, I should think about the context of their relationship. They were planning to have kids, which is a major life decision. When that becomes impossible, it's a significant blow. The author is struggling with his desire to have biological children, which is a personal value for him. But is it wrong to prioritize his own desires over staying in the relationship? \n\nOn one hand, walking away from a long-term partner after a major life event like this could be seen as heartless. His girlfriend is likely devastated, and he admits he doesn't want to break up with her right now because she needs him. That shows some level of consideration. But he's also honest about his feelings and not pretending that adoption or surrogacy are options he's comfortable with. \n\nIs it selfish to not want to adopt or use a surrogate? That's a personal choice. Some people feel strongly about biological children, while others are fine with other methods. The fact that he's not willing to compromise might make it hard to reconcile their differences. However, breaking up solely because of infertility could be seen as using the situation as a way to avoid commitment if he's not ready to adjust his plans.\n\nBut then again, if the core issue is his unwillingness to have a child through other means, and that's a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's not entirely his fault. Relationships require compromise, and if both partners can't meet halfway, it's hard to sustain the relationship. However, breaking up immediately after such news, when they were planning to get married, might seem abrupt and hurtful. The author is in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong?\n\nI think the key points are: 1) His decision is based on personal values about parenthood, which are valid but might be seen as inflexible. 2) The timing of the breakup, right after a traumatic event for his partner, which could be seen as insensitive. 3) Whether he's given enough time to process the news and explore other options together.\n\nHe hasn't decided yet, just thinking about it. But the fact that he's considering breaking up because of infertility, when they were planning to have kids, might make people see him as the asshole for prioritizing his biological child over the relationship. However, others might argue that it's his right to have the family he wants. It's a tough call, but leaning towards him being in the wrong because the breakup is more about his personal desires than a mutual decision, and doing it when she's vulnerable.\n"
