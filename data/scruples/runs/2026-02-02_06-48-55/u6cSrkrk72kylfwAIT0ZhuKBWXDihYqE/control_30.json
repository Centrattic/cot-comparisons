I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The situation is that they've been together over five years, and both wanted kids. Now that she can't have them, he's thinking about ending the relationship because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants to have his own children with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author mentions that he loves her and she's the love of his life, but he's struggling with the idea of not having biological kids. On one hand, his feelings are real\u2014people do have strong desires about parenthood. But on the other hand, using infertility as a reason to break up could be seen as prioritizing his own wishes over her feelings and their existing relationship.\n\nAlso, he acknowledges that she might be more hurt by this news and that she suggested alternatives like adoption. He didn't reject her suggestions outright but said he can't go through with them. That shows he's considering her, but maybe not enough. Relationships require compromise, and if he's unwilling to compromise on this major issue, it might be a deal-breaker for him. However, is it fair to end the relationship over something that wasn't his fault?\n\nAnother angle: infertility isn't a choice. The girlfriend didn't choose to be infertile. If the man's desire for biological children is so non-negotiable that he can't continue the relationship, maybe that's a flaw in how he prioritizes his values. But then again, people have different values, and if having a biological child is a core value for him, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. However, breaking up because of something beyond someone's control might be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the timing is important. They were about to get engaged, which means they had plans for the future including kids. If the inability to have biological children disrupts those plans, it's a significant change. But is that a reason to break up, or is it a reason to adjust plans? The author is in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong for prioritizing his own wishes? It's possible he's being selfish, but it's also possible he's being honest about his limitations.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is considering the emotional impact on his girlfriend and if he's giving enough thought to alternatives. He mentions that he's not ready to make a decision yet, which is good. However, the fact that he's even considering breaking up because of something she can't control might make others view him as the asshole. Relationships should be about mutual support and adaptation. If he can't adapt, maybe he's in the wrong. But it's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong answer.\n"
