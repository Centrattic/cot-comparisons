I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author is in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend. They were trying to have a baby for a year and found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate, and he wants his own biological kids with her. But since she can't carry them, he's thinking of ending the relationship. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The author is prioritizing his biological desire for children over his partner's feelings and their relationship. He acknowledges she's the love of his life but is considering leaving because his ideal scenario isn't possible. \n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Relationships often require compromise. The author isn't open to alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which his partner has suggested. That seems like a lack of willingness to adjust his expectations. While it's important for people to have children if that's a core value, using infertility as the main reason to break up, especially when the partner is unwilling to let go of the relationship, could be seen as selfish. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact on his girlfriend is significant. She's already dealing with the shock of infertility and is trying to find solutions. Ending the relationship on her back could be hurtful and not supportive. The author mentions she needs him, but he's considering leaving, which might make her feel abandoned. \n\nBut then again, personal values and desires matter in relationships. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, maybe he's not at fault for realizing that his needs aren't met. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014without considering alternatives beyond adoption or surrogacy\u2014might be where he's wrong. For example, maybe there are other options like sperm donation or other forms of assisted reproduction. But the author isn't open to those, which limits the possibilities.\n\nAlso, the timing is important. They were about to get engaged, which implies they had plans for the future that included children. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, maybe the author didn't fully communicate his expectations. But infertility wasn't a known factor before, so that complicates things.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might argue that it's unfair to break up because of something out of the partner's control. Infertility isn't her fault, so ending the relationship for that reason could be seen as blaming her. On the other hand, if having biological children is a fundamental part of his identity, then his decision isn't entirely his fault, but the way he's handling it is problematic.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is probably in the wrong because he's prioritizing his personal desire without considering the emotional toll on his partner and not exploring other viable options. His willingness to break up the relationship over something that's not her fault and not being open to compromises makes him the asshole here.\n"
