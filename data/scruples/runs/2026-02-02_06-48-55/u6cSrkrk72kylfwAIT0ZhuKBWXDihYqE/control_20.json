I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The guy is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They were trying to have a baby for a year and decided to get tested. The girlfriend is 26, he's 24. They've been together five years and she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nHe's devastated, but he also doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants biological kids, and he feels like he can't compromise there. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he breaks up for this reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasoning. He says he wants his own kids with his own woman, implying that he values biological connection. But he acknowledges it might sound selfish. On the other hand, he's in a committed relationship and loves her, but is conflicted. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, and he didn't reject them outright but didn't engage with them either.\n\nIs it fair to end the relationship over this? Well, values and personal desires about having children are significant. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him and the medical reality doesn't allow it, then ending the relationship might be his way of being honest about his limitations. However, he's also in a position where he hasn't even fully explored the alternatives she suggested. He said she proposed adoption or a surrogate, and he just said it's a good idea but didn't discuss it further. That could indicate a lack of communication or willingness to work through the issue.\n\nOn the flip side, he's in a lot of emotional turmoil. The timing of the breakup, right after such a devastating diagnosis, could be seen as insensitive. He mentions she's going through a tough time and doesn't want to break up during that, but he's considering it anyway. That might be selfish because she's already dealing with the infertility news and needing support.\n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't decided anything yet but is just considering options shows he's not rushed. But the core issue is whether ending the relationship based on infertility is justifiable. In some contexts, people do prioritize having biological children, but others might see it as a deal-breaker. However, walking away right after the diagnosis might not give the relationship a chance to adapt. \n\nAnother angle: he's 24 and she's 26. They might still have time to reconsider their options. Maybe surrogacy or adoption could be viable in the future, and breaking up now might be premature. But if he's certain he can't accept those options, then maybe it's a matter of incompatible future goals. \n\nBut the key here is that he hasn't even discussed the alternatives thoroughly. He dismissed adoption and surrogacy without deep consideration. If he's not open to those solutions, then his stance is clear, but if he's not engaging with them because he's not ready to talk about it, that might be a problem. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whether he's being fair and compassionate. Ending a five-year relationship over something that wasn't a previous issue (since they were trying to conceive and it wasn't possible) could be seen as using the situation as an excuse. However, if having biological kids is essential to him, it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut the timing and the way he's handling it\u2014suddenly considering a breakup after supporting each other through the news\u2014might make him look like he's not standing by his partner during a tough time. That's where the asshole aspect comes in. He's not just making a decision based on incompatible values but also possibly exploiting her vulnerability.\n\nSo weighing all that, I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's using the infertility as a reason to break up without fully processing his options and is not supporting his partner during her time of need. His decision seems more about his own limitations and not enough about what's best for the relationship.\n"
