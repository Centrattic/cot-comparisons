I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole\" post is in the wrong because they're considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have a baby. They couldn't conceive for a year, so they got tested. The girlfriend is infertile, and the guy wants to break up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological kids with her, which isn't possible. He loves her deeply but feels this is a dealbreaker.\n\nThe key points here are about personal values and relationship expectations. The guy is upfront about his stance on adoption and surrogacy. He's not forcing her to leave, but he's considering breaking up because having biological children is important to him. The question is whether this makes him an asshole.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, breaking up over infertility can be seen as selfish because it's a life choice that affects both partners. The girlfriend might feel rejected or that her worth is tied to her ability to have children. However, the guy is honest about his feelings and isn't pretending to be okay with alternatives if he's not. That honesty can be seen as fair, even if it's harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that wanting biological children is a valid desire, and if the relationship can't adapt, then it's not a healthy long-term partnership. Others might see it as using the infertility as an excuse to end the relationship, especially if the main issue is the inability to have biological kids despite loving her.\n\nThe response should consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, having biological children is highly valued, and in others, adoption or surrogacy might be more accepted. The guy's stance isn't illegal or unethical, but it's a personal choice that impacts his partner's life.\n\nThe author's actions depend on the context of their relationship. If they had discussed family plans before and the girlfriend had expected biological children, then his decision is understandable. If not, it might be a lack of communication. But since the post mentions they were considering adoption and the guy didn't want it, it's possible they hadn't resolved this issue before the test.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. He's not acting out of malice but personal values. However, breaking up based on infertility can be seen as prioritizing his desires over her feelings, especially when she's already hurting. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because it's a sensitive issue where his decision could be viewed as using the infertility as a reason to end a loving relationship, even if he's honest about his feelings.\n"
