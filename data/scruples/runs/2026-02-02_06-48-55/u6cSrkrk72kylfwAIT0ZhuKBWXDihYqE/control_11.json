I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and they're considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They love her a lot but can't get past wanting their own biological kids. The options are A (they're wrong) or B (they're not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for over five years, they wanted kids, and now the girlfriend can't conceive. The author is considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy. The girlfriend suggested those options, but the author isn't open to them. The question is whether the author is wrong for considering this breakup.\n\nNow, thinking about social and ethical perspectives. Relationships are built on mutual values and goals. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, but the girlfriend is open to alternatives like adoption, then maybe the author's stance is based on a personal preference that the girlfriend isn't willing to accept. However, the author is also showing empathy, acknowledging the girlfriend's feelings, and trying to be supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being selfish by not considering alternatives the girlfriend is willing to explore. They might see it as prioritizing their own desires over the relationship. But others might say that personal values and desires about parenthood are valid and it's not fair to stay in a relationship if those core values aren't aligned.\n\nThe original post also mentions that they haven't decided yet, so it's not a final decision. The author is seeking validation or criticism. The community's response would likely be divided. Some might support the author's honesty, while others might criticize them for breaking up over something that isn't the girlfriend's fault.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's already suggested adoption and surrogacy, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author, however, isn't open to those, which could make the breakup seem harsh. But if having biological children is a fundamental part of the author's identity, maybe it's hard to compromise here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, wanting biological kids isn't uncommon. However, the expectation to have them can sometimes lead to conflicts when circumstances prevent that. The question is whether the author is wrong for valuing that aspect so highly. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author is being honest about their feelings, but the decision could be seen as selfish. However, personal values and the desire for biological children are deeply personal. The answer might depend on whether staying in the relationship without the possibility of having biological kids is acceptable to both parties. Since the girlfriend is open to alternatives and the author isn't, the author's stance might be seen as the problem. But it's not clear if that's the case. \n\nThe \"asshole\" aspect often hinges on empathy and communication. The author is trying to communicate their feelings, though it's a difficult situation. They're also considering the girlfriend's emotional state. However, the decision to break up based on a medical condition that isn't the girlfriend's fault could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, in terms of answer A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong), it's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the girlfriend is offering alternatives and the author refuses, which could be seen as not meeting them halfway, maybe A is more likely. However, there's also the argument that personal values are valid. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the majority view here would be that the author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own desire for biological children over the existing relationship and the alternatives the partner is willing to consider. So answer A.\n"
