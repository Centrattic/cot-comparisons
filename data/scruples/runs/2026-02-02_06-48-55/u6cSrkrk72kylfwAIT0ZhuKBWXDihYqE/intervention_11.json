I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is complex because both are in love, have been together for 5 years, and the main issue is the desire for biological children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He wants his own biological child, and since his girlfriend can't have one, he's thinking of breaking up. He finds adoption and surrogacy unappealing. He acknowledges it might sound selfish but feels it's part of his values. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was about to be his fianc\u00e9e, and this news is a big blow. The author is considering breaking up, which could be seen as abandoning her during a hard time, even if he's not ready to commit to alternatives. The fact that he hasn't decided yet but is sharing this publicly might indicate he's seeking validation.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is wrong. So, I need to evaluate if the author is being selfish or if this is a valid personal value. Relationships require compromise. If having biological children is non-negotiable, then the relationship might not work. However, breaking up immediately after the news, when they're still supporting each other, might be hasty and seem heartless.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not being able to adopt, which is a significant decision. It's important to consider if he's given the matter enough thought or if it's a temporary reaction. The emotional impact on the girlfriend is a key factor here. The author is in a position of power here, as he's the one considering ending the relationship, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, while the desire for biological children is personal, the timing and manner of considering a breakup might make the author at fault. Relationships require mutual effort and understanding. The author's refusal to consider alternatives (even if that's his truth) and the immediate thought of splitting up could be seen as not fully supporting his partner during a difficult time, thus making him the \"asshole\" in this WIBTA context.\n"
