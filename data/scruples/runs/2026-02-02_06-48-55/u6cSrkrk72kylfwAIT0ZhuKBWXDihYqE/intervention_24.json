I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The main points here are about his feelings towards wanting biological children and not considering adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for five years, they were planning to get married, and they had been trying to conceive for a year. The girlfriend suggested adoption or a surrogate, but the author doesn't want that. He feels that he wants his own kids with his partner, meaning she needs to carry them. He's contemplating a breakup because of this, even though he loves her.\n\nThe key question is whether this makes him the asshole. On one hand, he's honest about his feelings and is trying to be considerate of her situation. He's acknowledging her pain and that breaking up might be hard for her. But on the other hand, he's using her infertility as a reason to end the relationship, which might seem selfish or unrealistic given that there are alternatives like adoption or surrogacy.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. Some people might argue that wanting biological children is natural and that not considering alternatives is limiting. Others might say that using infertility as a reason to break up is unfair because it's a medical condition beyond her control. The author is being upfront, but is it right to end a long-term relationship over this?\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, but the author isn't engaging with those options. He's dismissing them without really exploring them. That could be seen as not making an effort to work through the problem together, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. His reasoning might come off as prioritizing his own desires over the relationship, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nHowever, he's also in a difficult position. He's struggling with his own desires and feels that he can't compromise. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's being unreasonable. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his limitations, but the way he's handling it could be problematic if he's not considering other options thoroughly.\n\nIn conclusion, while his intentions might be to be honest, the decision to break up solely based on infertility might be seen as him not being willing to make necessary compromises, which could make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
