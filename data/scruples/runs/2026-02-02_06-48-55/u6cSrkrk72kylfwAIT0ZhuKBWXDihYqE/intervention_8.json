I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering she's infertile.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get engaged. They wanted to have kids, tried for a year, then found out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is torn because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate and is thinking about breaking up, even though he loves her and wants to support her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I should consider the ethical implications here. The main issue is whether it's wrong to end a long-term relationship based on infertility. Some people might argue that it's selfish to prioritize having biological children over the relationship, especially since the girlfriend already suggested alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. Others might say that wanting biological children is a valid personal choice, and if both parties can't agree on an alternative, the author isn't in the wrong for considering the breakup.\n\nImportant factors: the author hasn't made a final decision yet, he's being honest about his feelings, and he's trying to process this. The girlfriend is clearly upset, but he's also acknowledging her feelings and the potential hurt. The key is whether breaking up over infertility is a moral failing. \n\nIn many cases, people have different non-negotiables in a relationship. If the author's desire for biological children is a deal-breaker for him and he's being truthful and compassionate, then it's not necessarily wrong. However, if the breakup is impulsive or not giving enough consideration to the girlfriend's feelings and their relationship's strength, it could be seen as wrong. The author is trying to be fair, but the fact that he's leaning towards breaking up despite her efforts to find solutions (like adoption) might be seen as not valuing her enough. \n\nAlso, considering the alternatives: surrogacy and adoption are options, but the author isn't open to them. That makes his stance seem more about his personal preference than a mutual decision. The girlfriend may be willing to explore these, but he's not. That lack of willingness to compromise could be where the wrong lies. \n\nSo, based on this, the author is making a personal choice that conflicts with the girlfriend's solutions. While it's his right to have those feelings, acting on them without considering the emotional impact and the depth of their relationship might make him the asshole. The answer would likely be A, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not considering other options and prioritizing his own desires over the relationship he's built with someone who has offered alternatives.\n"
