I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together for over five years, were planning to get engaged, and had been trying to have a baby for a year. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is struggling with the idea of not being able to have biological children. He mentions considering adoption or surrogacy, but he doesn't want those options. He feels selfish but is questioning if it's okay to want his own kids with his partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal values and relationship dynamics. The author is honest about his feelings, which is important. He acknowledges that his perspective might not be popular and is seeking validation. The question is whether breaking up over infertility is morally wrong.\n\nInfertility can be a significant issue for people who prioritize biological children. However, the girlfriend suggested alternatives, showing she's open to other ways of having kids. The author hasn't outright rejected her suggestions but is struggling with them personally. It's crucial to consider if his feelings are a dealbreaker or if there's room for compromise.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the author can't support his partner in this situation and is considering leaving despite her needing him, that might be seen as self-centered. On the other hand, if his desire for biological children is a fundamental part of his identity and he can't adjust his expectations, it's a personal choice that might not be \"wrong\" but could still be hurtful.\n\nThe community often views someone who prioritizes biological children over a partner's well-being as the asshole because it can seem like abandoning the relationship in a vulnerable time. However, the author hasn't made a final decision yet and is contemplating options. The decision to break up isn't made lightly, and he's considering the emotional impact on her.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether it's acceptable to end a relationship for personal desires, especially when it's a medical issue beyond their control. The author is in a tough spot, but his approach could be seen as wrong because he's focusing on his own needs without fully engaging with the alternatives his partner proposed. It's possible he could work through this with support, but if he ultimately decides to leave, it might reflect selfishness. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since he hasn't acted yet and is seeking advice, maybe the answer is A because the intention to break up for this reason is considered selfish and harmful, even if it's his personal belief.\n"
