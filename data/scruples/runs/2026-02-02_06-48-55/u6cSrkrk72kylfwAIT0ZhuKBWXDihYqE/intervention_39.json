I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this scenario is in the wrong after considering breaking up with their girlfriend due to her infertility. The original post is from a guy who's been with his girlfriend for over five years. They tried to have a baby for almost a year and found out she's infertile. He says he's devastated, supports her, but now he's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants his own biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The guy admitted he's not thinking straight and called his feelings \"weird.\" He also says he gets it might sound selfish. The main issue here is whether infertility is a valid reason to break up, especially when it's not his fault. The girlfriend's suggestion of adoption or surrogacy is met with him agreeing but not engaging further. He's considering leaving because he can't accept these alternatives, even though he loves her.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, people have different needs and expectations. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, that's his personal choice. However, the situation is complicated because the infertility is on his partner. If he's unwilling to consider any alternatives she's proposed, that could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over hers and the relationship they've built. It's important to acknowledge that his feelings are real, but acting on them without fully working through the issue could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were about to get engaged adds weight to the decision. The girlfriend is likely in a vulnerable state, and breaking up right after such news might make her feel rejected. The guy needs to reflect on whether his reasons are truly about biological children or if there's something deeper, like fear or pressure. Open, ongoing communication is key here. If he hasn't fully explored these options with her or given her time to process, jumping to a breakup could be premature and inconsiderate.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's a shift towards accepting alternative family structures, but personal values vary. The guy's stance might not be the \"wrong\" in a moral sense, but it's definitely a point of contention. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just if it's a bad decision. The user thinks he is, so I need to weigh that. The answer hinges on whether his decision is selfish or a genuine conflict in values. Given that he's in the process of considering and hasn't decided yet, but the thought of breaking up over this is based on his personal desire for biological kids, it's possible he is in the wrong for not considering his partner's feelings and the alternatives she's open to. The choice to leave after a long relationship because he can't accept adoption or surrogacy might be seen as prioritizing his unmet desire over the existing commitment and her well-being.\n"
