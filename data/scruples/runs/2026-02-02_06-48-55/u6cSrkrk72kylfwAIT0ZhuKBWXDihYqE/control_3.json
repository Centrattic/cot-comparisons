I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over five years, tried for a baby for a year, and found out she's infertile. He mentions he's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids with her, and he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He's torn between loving her and his desire for biological children.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to break up over infertility. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider various perspectives. Legally, in many places, infertility isn't a valid legal ground for divorce, but this isn't a legal question. Morally, it's more complex. The person is in a difficult situation, emotionally. He's trying to be honest about his feelings, but it's still a tough decision for his partner. \n\nInfertility can be a significant stressor in relationships. The girlfriend is likely already dealing with the emotional impact of the diagnosis. If the boyfriend is considering leaving because he can't accept alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, that could be seen as selfish. He acknowledges that it sounds selfish, which shows some self-awareness. \n\nHowever, personal preferences matter. Some people value biological children highly. The key is whether he's being honest and respectful. He's not making a decision yet, but he's considering it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for even thinking about it. \n\nOthers might argue that it's valid to want biological children, but breaking up over it without exhausting all options (like surrogacy) might be too hasty. The girlfriend might also have her own feelings about adoption or surrogacy. The fact that she suggested those options and he dismissed them without further discussion could be a problem. \n\nAdditionally, the timing matters. Breaking up right after such a traumatic diagnosis could be seen as insensitive. He mentions he doesn't want to hurt her, but considering a breakup during her vulnerable time could be viewed as wrong. However, if staying in the relationship would lead to long-term unhappiness for both, maybe it's better to part ways. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is justified. If he's being honest about his non-negotiables and the relationship can't adapt, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's prioritizing his own desires without considering her feelings or alternatives, it's more his fault. Since he's still considering options, it's a bit unclear. \n\nIn similar WIBTA scenarios, people are often called out for not considering alternatives or being too self-centered. Here, he's not giving adoption or surrogacy a real chance, just dismissing them. That could make him the asshole. Also, the emotional timing is rough. \n\nSo, leaning towards A (wrong) because he's not fully exploring alternatives and the breakup decision might be too harsh right after the infertility diagnosis.\n"
