I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He mentions that he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate and wants to have his own biological kids with his partner. The key points here are the author's feelings towards wanting biological children, the girlfriend's suggestion of alternatives, and his consideration of breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reasoning is valid. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his desire for biological children over staying in the relationship. The girlfriend is clearly affected by this news, as it's a major blow to her. The author acknowledges her emotional state but is struggling with his own feelings.\n\nBiologically, the inability to conceive might not be seen as a deal-breaker for some, but the author is adamant about wanting his own child. This raises the question of whether it's selfish or reasonable. The author is in his early 20s, so maybe he's not considering all options yet, like adoption or surrogacy. But he's also clear that he doesn't want those options. \n\nThe girlfriend is supporting him, but he's considering breaking up because he can't reconcile his desire for biological children. The ethical dilemma here is about whether his decision is fair to his partner. The author is in a vulnerable position too, but he's using this as a reason to end the relationship. \n\nIn many cases, relationships can face challenges like this, and the key is communication and mutual support. The author hasn't given the relationship a chance to adjust to this new reality. Instead, he's leaning towards breaking up, which might be seen as avoiding the problem. \n\nHowever, his feelings might be genuine. He doesn't want to adopt, and that's his personal choice. But the question is whether it's fair to end the relationship over it. The girlfriend might feel rejected or abandoned, especially since this is a shared challenge. The author is also aware that his thoughts might sound selfish. \n\nConsidering all this, the author could be in the wrong because he's choosing to end the relationship based on his personal preference without fully exploring alternatives or compromising. The girlfriend has already suggested adoption and surrogacy, which he dismissed. If he's unwilling to consider those, but she is open to them, breaking up might be his way of avoiding the issue rather than working through it together. \n\nOn the other hand, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe it's valid for him to realize that they have incompatible future plans. However, given the context, he's still in the early stages of processing the news and hasn't given the relationship a chance to adapt. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
