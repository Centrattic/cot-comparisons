I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she's found out to be infertile. He's thinking about it because he wants biological kids and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple had been trying for a baby for a year, so having children is a shared goal. The discovery that the girlfriend is infertile is a major emotional hit. The guy supports her, but he's struggling with the idea of not having biological children. He's considering breaking up because he can't see himself adopting or using a surrogate. \n\nNow, the key question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to break up. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and priorities. He loves her but can't get past the biological aspect. On the other hand, this decision could be seen as selfish or insensitive, especially right after delivering such bad news. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and breaking up might add to her emotional distress.\n\nI should think about the context. The guy hasn't made a decision yet, is considering options, and is trying to process his feelings. The fact that he supports her and acknowledges the difficulty shows empathy. But the core issue is his stance on adoption and surrogacy. His reasoning is that he wants his own kids, which is a personal desire, but it's leading him to consider ending the relationship. \n\nIs it fair to end a long-term relationship based on this? Some might argue that love and commitment should outweigh the inability to have biological children, especially when alternatives exist. Others might say that if someone's non-negotiable is having biological children and that's not possible, then the relationship may not be sustainable. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's the one with the desire for biological kids, while the infertility is on the partner's side, could influence perceptions. Some might see this as placing an unfair burden on the partner. However, the guy is upfront and hasn't acted yet, so he's still in a reflective phase. \n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a range. Some cultures place a high value on biological children, others are more open to adoption. But generally, in modern contexts, people are encouraged to explore alternatives. However, the guy is clear he can't consider those, which complicates things. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? If he ends the relationship, is that wrong? Well, it's his choice, but it's based on a non-negotiable that may not be fair to his partner. He's not wrong in feeling the way he does, but acting on it could be seen as selfish. The fact that he's considering it while she's already dealing with the infertility adds to the emotional weight. \n\nI think the answer here is that he's in the wrong (A) because his decision is based on a personal desire for biological children that he's unwilling to compromise on, which could be seen as placing the burden of infertility on his partner. Even though he's in a tough spot, the timing and the lack of willingness to consider alternatives might make his potential decision seem harsh. However, there's nuance because everyone's values differ. But based on the question's setup, the answer is likely A.\n"
