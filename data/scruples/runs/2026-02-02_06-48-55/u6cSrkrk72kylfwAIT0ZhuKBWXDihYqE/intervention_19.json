I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is 24, they've been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. The main issue here is that the author wants biological children but isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. The girlfriend is suggesting alternatives, but he's considering a breakup because he can't accept those options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice. The fact that the author is considering leaving because of this could be seen as problematic. Relationships require compromise, and if one partner has a non-negotiable that the other can't meet, that's a valid reason for a breakup. But the author is the one with the non-negotiable here, not the other way around. The girlfriend is offering alternatives, which might be a sign of flexibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author does express that he wants biological children and feels that the options provided don't fulfill that. But adoption and surrogacy are viable paths to parenthood, even if they don't involve the biological parent. The key question here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Some people might argue that biological connection is important, but others might see it as selfish to prioritize that over a relationship with someone who is otherwise a perfect partner.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant. She's already devastated by the infertility diagnosis, and being dumped on top of that would be cruel. The author mentions he doesn't want to put her through a breakup right now, but he's still considering it. That shows some awareness of her emotional state, but the decision itself could be seen as heartless.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing acceptance of alternative family structures. The author's refusal to consider these options might be viewed as outdated or inflexible. However, personal values vary, and what's important is that both partners are on the same page. The author hasn't communicated this clearly yet, as he says he's still considering options. But the idea of breaking up solely because of infertility without exploring alternatives could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility in relationships. Both partners should have discussed their desires for children before getting deeply into the relationship. If the author didn't make his stance clear about wanting biological children, then perhaps the timing of this realization is a factor. However, infertility can be unexpected, so maybe the author's reaction is a result of unmet expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the fact that he's considering ending the relationship because of a medical condition that's out of his partner's control and her efforts to find alternatives suggests that he might be in the wrong. It's about whether the desire for biological children outweighs the commitment to a partner who is otherwise compatible.\n"
