I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person wrote a WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post about considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They've been together over five years, and they wanted kids. When they found out she can't have biological children, he's contemplating breaking up because he wants his own kids. He says he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her, but the thought of not having biological kids is driving him to break up.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing. The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives, but he's not open to those options. His reasoning is that he wants a child that's biologically theirs. Is it fair to break up over something that's beyond her control? Also, he mentions it's not easy for her, and she's likely feeling hurt and devastated. Breaking up over this could be seen as selfish and hurtful, especially since she's already struggling with the diagnosis.\n\nHe says he loves her and doesn't want to put her through a breakup now, but his own desires are leading him to consider it. The question is whether his feelings justify the breakup. From a compassionate standpoint, it's his values vs her well-being. He might believe he can't be happy with adoption, but that's his choice, not hers. It's important to consider if this is a dealbreaker for him, and if so, whether he should have communicated that earlier in the relationship when they were discussing having kids.\n\nAlso, the term \"own kids\" might imply he values biological connection more, but others might argue that the emotional bond is what matters in parenthood. By choosing to break up, he's prioritizing his own preferences over the relationship they built. The girlfriend might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility, even though it's not her fault. That could be emotionally damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say he's being honest about his needs. If he can't accept adoption or surrogacy, maybe the relationship was never going to work for his goals. But the key point here is the timing and the way it's being handled. The girlfriend is already reeling from the news, and breaking up then could be seen as callous. He should be considering her feelings and providing support rather than contemplating a breakup.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some people might understand not wanting adoption, using infertility as a reason to break up can be seen as selfish. Relationships often require compromise, and if having biological children is a non-negotiable, the person might have been in the wrong earlier for not addressing that in their planning. Now, after the fact, using it as a reason to break up could be viewed as the asshole move.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he's using an uncontrollable situation as a dealbreaker without considering the emotional impact on his partner and not exploring all alternatives that could have been discussed. He's also not taking responsibility for his own expectations and how they affect the relationship.\n"
