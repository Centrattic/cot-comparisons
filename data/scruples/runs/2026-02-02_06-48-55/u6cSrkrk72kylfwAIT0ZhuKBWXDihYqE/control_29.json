I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is that they've been together over five years, were planning to get engaged, and had been trying to have a baby for a year. They went for tests, and it's confirmed the girlfriend is infertile. She suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author is against those options and wants biological kids. He's torn between staying and supporting her or breaking up because he can't accept alternatives.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if breaking up over infertility is morally wrong. It's a personal decision, and relationships can have various priorities. The author feels selfish but is honest about his feelings. However, the girlfriend might feel rejected or disrespected if he leaves, especially since she's already offered alternatives. The key points here are communication, mutual understanding, and the impact on both parties.\n\nThe author hasn't decided yet and is considering options. He says he loves her and doesn't want to hurt her, but his desire for biological children is causing him to think of a breakup. The question is whether his priorities make him wrong. In many ethical discussions, treating someone with respect and considering their feelings is crucial. If the author can't support her through this, it might be seen as selfish. But if the relationship was built around wanting a biological child and that's a non-negotiable for him, maybe his decision isn't entirely his fault.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have different feelings. She could feel that her efforts (like considering surrogacy or adoption) are not being acknowledged. The author might be in the wrong if he's using this as an excuse to leave instead of working through it. But if he's clear about his needs and they can't find a compromise, it's a difficult situation. The answer likely depends on whether he approaches the conversation with empathy and honesty. Since he hasn't acted yet and is conflicted, maybe the focus is on his intentions. The community might view it as wrong because he's prioritizing his biological desire over her feelings and the existing relationship. But others might say it's his right to have personal boundaries. Hmm.\n"
