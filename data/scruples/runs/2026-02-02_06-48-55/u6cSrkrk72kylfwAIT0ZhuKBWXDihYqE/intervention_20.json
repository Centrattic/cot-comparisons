I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile and the guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the couple had been trying to have a baby for a year, the woman is infertile, and the man wants biological kids but isn't considering alternatives. He's thinking about breaking up because he can't adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her but feels this is a deal-breaker.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, he's honest about his feelings. He acknowledges that his stance might seem selfish. But is he wrong for having this opinion? Well, people have different values and desires. Wanting biological children is a personal choice. However, breaking up over infertility can be seen as putting his needs above hers, especially since she's already suggested alternatives he's dismissing.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might feel rejected if the man can't accept her situation. The fact that they were about to get engaged adds another layer. Committing to marriage without being open about this possibility could be a problem, but the man's honesty about his feelings after the diagnosis complicates things.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might argue that not wanting adoption is selfish, while others respect personal preferences. The man's emotional reaction is valid, but the timing and method of handling the breakup matter. If he's considering leaving her during a vulnerable time, that's unkind. Also, he admits he's not thinking clearly, which suggests he might not be making a fully reasoned decision.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether breaking up over infertility is a justified decision. Since the woman is infertile and he can't accept alternatives, it's a personal choice, but it could be seen as inconsiderate to her feelings. The author might be wrong to break up solely based on this, especially if there are other options they haven't explored together. However, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then it's his right to make that choice, even if it's painful for both.\n\nBut the way he's approaching it\u2014considering a breakup without fully discussing alternatives or giving her space to process\u2014could be seen as hasty. The woman might feel abandoned, especially after supporting each other through the news. The man's self-awareness about being selfish is a point in his favor, but actions still matter. If he's not considering her emotional state and future happiness, he might be wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because breaking up based on infertility without exploring all options and considering her feelings could be seen as selfish and hurtful. However, there's nuance here. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is his inability to accept her alternatives, leading to a breakup, that's a strong indicator he's at fault.\n"
