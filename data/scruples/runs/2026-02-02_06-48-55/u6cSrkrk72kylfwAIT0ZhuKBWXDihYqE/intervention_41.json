I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate. He's 24, they've been together five years, and they were planning to get engaged. He loves her but feels he wants his own biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is whether his decision to break up is justified. The author is conflicted because he loves her but doesn't want to pursue alternatives to having their own child. He acknowledges that his stance might sound selfish. \n\nSo, the question is: Is he in the wrong for considering breaking up solely because he can't accept adoption or a surrogate? Let's break it down. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions like having children often require compromise. If both partners are in agreement about wanting biological children and it's not possible, that's a problem. But here, the author is not okay with alternatives. The girlfriend is offering solutions (adoption, surrogate), but he's rejecting them. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that his desire for biological children is valid, but the way he's handling the situation could be problematic. By not being open to alternatives, he's effectively ending the relationship because of an unmet personal desire, which could hurt his girlfriend. She might feel rejected, especially after being there for each other through the infertility diagnosis.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings and hasn't acted yet. He's seeking advice, which shows he's considering the consequences. However, the fact that he's contemplating breaking up based solely on his inability to accept adoption/surrogacy might be seen as self-centered, especially if he was aware of possible infertility risks beforehand.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author says he supported her, but maybe they didn't discuss their views on alternatives before the diagnosis. If they had, maybe they could have found a middle ground. Now, he's realizing his stance is a deal-breaker, but only after the fact. That could be seen as not being fully committed to the relationship through challenges.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on his girlfriend. She's already dealing with the devastation of infertility and the possibility of rejection adds another layer of emotional pain. Ending the relationship might feel like a betrayal, even if he's being honest.\n\nBut there's also the argument that everyone has different needs. If he truly cannot accept adoption or surrogacy, then maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. However, the question is whether that makes him the asshole. It's a tough call because it's about personal values versus hurting someone else.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing acceptance of alternative family structures, but not everyone is open to them. His stance might be viewed as outdated or selfish by some, but others might see it as a personal choice. The key here is whether his decision is fair given the circumstances and how he's handling it.\n\nThe author is in a vulnerable position, but considering breaking up because he can't adapt to the new reality might be seen as inconsiderate. He's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the relationship, which has been long-term. The girlfriend might feel that he's not willing to work through this together, which is a significant part of any partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is being honest about his feelings, the way he's handling the situation\u2014potentially breaking up because he can't accept alternatives\u2014could be considered selfish. Therefore, many people might say he's in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
