I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Will I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He mentions he wants his own kids with his own woman, implying he wants a biological child from the woman he's with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The couple has been together five years, which is a significant time. The news about infertility is a major life event. The guy is struggling with the idea that they can't have biological children, and he's contemplating breaking up because he's not open to adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships require compromise. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe that's a personal choice. But breaking up because of infertility could be seen as using her as a means to an end for having his own kids, which might be selfish. However, it's also his right to have certain expectations in a relationship. The problem is that he's considering ending the relationship based on a fundamental difference in values or desires.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's trying to find solutions. If he's unwilling to consider those options, it might indicate that his desire for biological children is a deal-breaker, which is his prerogative, but it's important to consider how this affects her. Ending the relationship after she's already going through a tough time could be seen as selfish, especially if he's the one who's not flexible.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is significant. The girlfriend might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility, which is not her fault. The guy's decision to break up could add emotional trauma. However, if having biological kids is a core part of his identity and he can't see beyond that, maybe it's not fair to her to stay in a relationship where he's unhappy.\n\nBut the key point here is that he hasn't decided yet. He's considering breaking up because he can't compromise on adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether that's being selfish. If he's honest about his stance early in the process, maybe it's understandable. However, since they were planning to get married and the woman is clearly hurt, breaking up after the fact might be seen as using her and then leaving when things don't meet his expectations.\n\nAnother angle: relationships should be about mutual support. If he's using her for the purpose of having a child and now wants to leave because that can't happen, that's a problem. But if he's clear that having biological kids is a non-negotiable from the start, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, since they were already trying for a year and she offered alternatives, he might have known this was a potential issue and is now facing the reality.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might see it as selfish to leave someone over infertility, especially if the other partner is willing to adapt. Others might see it as a personal choice to prioritize one's own desires. The answer depends on the cultural context and personal values.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the girlfriend is making efforts to adjust, and he's ending the relationship due to a non-issue (infertility) that wasn't fully discussed before the commitment. However, if having biological children was a key factor he didn't consider before, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But generally, walking away after she's already going through the pain might be seen as selfish.\n"
