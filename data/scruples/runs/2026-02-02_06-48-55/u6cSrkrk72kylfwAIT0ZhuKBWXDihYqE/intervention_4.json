I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together for over five years. They were trying to have a baby for almost a year and decided to check their fertility. It turns out she's infertile. He mentions that he wants to have his own biological kids with the woman he's with, and he's considering breaking up because adoption or surrogacy aren't options for him. He loves her but feels that he can't have his own biological kids with her, so he's thinking of ending the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical angles. Infertility is a medical condition, not a personal failing. The girlfriend has done nothing wrong. The author is prioritizing his desire for biological children over the relationship. But isn't personal choice important? On the other hand, ending a long-term relationship over this could be seen as selfish because it's a significant life decision that affects both people.\n\nThe girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. The author dismisses these options, which might show a lack of flexibility. If the couple can't find a compromise, maybe the breakup isn't entirely his fault, but the way he's approaching it might be. He mentions he's not thinking straight, which adds complexity. Is it fair to end a relationship based on a personal preference without fully exploring alternatives?\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is a factor. She's going through a tough time, and breaking up right after could be cruel. The author acknowledges that he knows she needs him, yet he's considering leaving. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if he truly can't accept non-biological children, maybe staying together would be a lie. But is that a valid reason?\n\nSocietal norms might influence this. Some people view biological children as essential, others not. But relationships often require compromise. If the author is unwilling to compromise, is he in the wrong? The girlfriend is open to alternatives, but he isn't. That imbalance might mean he's the one making the selfish choice.\n\nOn the flip side, personal desires and values are important too. If he can't be happy without biological kids, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship that can't fulfill that. But does that justify breaking up after five years and when she's already facing a tough diagnosis? It's a tough call. The key here is whether his decision is based on selfishness or genuine incompatibility.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of willingness to compromise. The girlfriend is suggesting other paths, but he's shutting those down. If he's not even open to discussing them further, that could be where the problem lies. His decision to break up might be about his own needs rather than hers, which could make him the asshole. However, if he's certain that he can't adopt or use a surrogate, maybe it's a matter of personal values. But given the emotional context, prioritizing his biological desire over her emotional state could be seen as wrong.\n"
