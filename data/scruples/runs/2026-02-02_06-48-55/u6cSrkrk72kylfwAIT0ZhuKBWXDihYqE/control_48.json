I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole?) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have a baby. They tried for a year and then checked both their fertility. The girlfriend is infertile, and they're both upset. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or a surrogate and wants to have biological kids with her. He loves her but feels this is a deal-breaker.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal values and relationship expectations. The author is struggling with his desire for biological children versus his commitment to his partner. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, which he acknowledged but isn't open to. The question is whether his potential decision to break up makes him the asshole.\n\nI should consider societal perspectives. Many people value different things in a relationship. If someone's core value is having biological children and their partner can't fulfill that, they might see breaking up as a difficult but honest decision. However, others might argue that his choice is selfish because the infertility isn't the girlfriend's fault, and he's prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, especially at a vulnerable time.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend is devastated and needs support. If he's breaking up now, it could be seen as adding emotional harm. But he also says he hasn't decided yet and is trying to consider all options. His hesitation and the fact that he's trying to process this show some consideration.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't clearly express his stance on adoption before the test results. If he had different expectations, it's possible he didn't communicate them well. However, he did respond to her suggestions but didn't push further. Maybe both sides need to have a deeper conversation about their values.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships often require compromise. If the author's non-negotiable is having biological children, and the situation makes that impossible, he might feel he can't proceed. But if he's breaking up primarily for a reason that's not her fault (like infertility), it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's also his right to set relationship boundaries based on his personal values.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It's a tough situation. The decision hinges on whether prioritizing biological children over the partner's well-being is selfish or reasonable. Some might say that love should overcome such obstacles, while others believe it's valid to have limits.\n\nGiven all this, I think the answer isn't clear-cut. But considering the girlfriend's emotional state and the fact that the author is considering breaking up due to a factor beyond her control, many might side that he's in the wrong for potentially using this as a reason to leave, especially since he admits it feels selfish. However, others might empathize with his stance on biological kids. I need to decide based on the majority perspective here. Typically, such cases are seen as the person using infertility as a reason to break up being the asshole unless there's mutual agreement on having kids. Here, the author hasn't communicated his non-negotiable stance earlier, and the situation is new, so he might be in the wrong for considering it now when she's vulnerable.\n"
