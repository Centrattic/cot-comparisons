I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The setup is that they've been together for five years, wanted kids, and she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants biological kids. He loves her, but can't get past this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if his reaction is justified. The key points here are about personal values and relationship expectations. The author is honest about his feelings. He states he can't change his desire for biological children. Now, is it wrong to prioritize that over the relationship?\n\nIn relationships, people have different deal-breakers. Some might think that wanting biological kids is a personal choice, and if that's non-negotiable, then it's not necessarily wrong to consider leaving. On the other hand, some might argue that it's selfish to end a loving relationship over something that can be addressed with alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, especially when the partner is offering those solutions.\n\nThe author acknowledges that his stance might seem selfish. But he's also in a difficult emotional state. The question is whether his feelings make him the asshole. Society often views wanting biological children as a valid personal desire. However, ending a long-term relationship over this, especially when alternatives are on the table, could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend is clearly hurt, and he's aware of that. But he's also being honest about his limits. \n\nIt's a tough call. If he's being truthful about his non-negotiables and they can't find a middle ground, maybe it's not his fault. But if he's dismissing her suggestions and not considering her feelings, that could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, given that he's considering all options and hasn't made a decision yet, it's a personal choice. So, whether he's in the wrong might not be a clear yes or no. But according to the instructions, I have to pick A or B. The community often frowns on breaking up over infertility when alternatives exist. So maybe A (wrong) is the answer. But others might say it's his right. Hmm."
