I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile. They had been trying to have a baby for a year. The guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants a biological child with his partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The guy is honest about his feelings and is not rushing into a decision. He's been supportive of his girlfriend, which is good. But his main issue is about not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate. Is it selfish to want biological kids? That's subjective. Some people value genetic ties, others don't. The girlfriend is offering alternatives, but he can't accept them.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. Did he communicate his stance clearly before they faced this situation? If they had discussed their views on having children earlier, maybe this wouldn't be an issue now. But the scenario says they were planning to get married and thought the time was right for kids. Maybe they didn't talk enough about their non-negotiables regarding parenthood.\n\nIs breaking up immediately after this news the right move? It shows he's under a lot of stress and might not have considered all options. The girlfriend is more open to alternatives, but he's not. He's in a tough spot, but is it fair to end the relationship because of differing life goals that were not discussed earlier?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is he being selfish by prioritizing his biological child over her feelings? It's a valid personal preference, but ending the relationship immediately could be seen as abrupt. However, if his happiness is tied to having biological children and he can't compromise, maybe it's not fair to stay in a relationship that can't meet his core desire.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact on his girlfriend. He mentions she's more devastated by the infertility news. Breaking up might add to her emotional burden. Is he being considerate by waiting to decide or by potentially leaving her when she's vulnerable?\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid feelings, the timing and lack of prior discussion might make his potential decision harsh. However, if having a biological child is non-negotiable for him, then it's a matter of differing priorities. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the depth of their communication before this crisis. Since the scenario suggests they had been planning for kids but didn't discuss alternatives, it's possible he's in the wrong for not considering this earlier. But it's also a personal choice. The answer is tricky, but leaning towards he is in the wrong because the decision is driven by a personal preference without considering the timing and his partner's emotional state.\n"
