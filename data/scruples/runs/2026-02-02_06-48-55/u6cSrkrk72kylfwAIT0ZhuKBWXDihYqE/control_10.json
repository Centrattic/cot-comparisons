I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They tried to conceive for a year and found out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants biological kids with her. He loves her but can't reconcile his desire for biological children with her infertility.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal values, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. Infertility is a significant issue, and the author is struggling with his priorities. The girlfriend is suggesting alternatives, but the author feels these aren't viable for him.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility in major life goals like having children is crucial. If one partner's deal-breaker is not met, that can lead to a breakup. However, the author is acknowledging that his stance might seem selfish and is trying to process his feelings while being supportive. \n\nThe question of right or wrong is subjective. From one angle, the author is honest about his desires, which is important in a committed relationship. On the other hand, breaking up after a long-term relationship could be seen as harsh, especially if it's primarily about the inability to have biological children. Society often has varying views on this\u2014some might see it as valid, others as insensitive.\n\nI should also consider the emotional impact. The girlfriend is already going through a tough time, and the author is conflicted about breaking up during this period. His intention to be supportive is there, but the decision could be seen as prioritizing his own biological child wish over the relationship. However, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then it's a personal choice he's making.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, relationships require compromise. If both partners can't meet each other's essential needs, then the relationship might not be sustainable. The author is at a crossroads where his core desire (biological kids with her) can't be fulfilled. So, is he wrong? It's a tough call. His feelings are valid, but the timing and sensitivity matter. However, he's not forcing her to adopt or using the infertility as an excuse without considering her feelings. He's reflecting and considering the breakup out of personal conflict, not malice.\n\nIn the WIBTA context, the community often looks at intentions and actions. If he's being honest and not being cruel, some might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, others might argue that not exploring alternatives more thoroughly or being more empathetic could make him the asshole. But since he's grappling with his feelings and hasn't made a decision yet, the answer might hinge on whether having biological children is a legitimate deal-breaker. If it's a core value, then it's not necessarily his fault.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), because he's not being malicious but is facing a personal conflict with valid reasons.\n"
