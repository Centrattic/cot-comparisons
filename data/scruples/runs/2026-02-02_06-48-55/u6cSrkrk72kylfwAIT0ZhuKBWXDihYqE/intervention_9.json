I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is that the person is considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They love her and have been together for over five years. The main issue is that he wants biological children and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. He's torn between staying with her and breaking up because he can't see a future with adoption.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. The key points are his values about having a biological child versus her being unable to provide that. The question is whether it's fair to break up over this. On one hand, his desire for biological children is valid, but on the other hand, he's making a decision that could be seen as selfish, especially since he's the one initiating the breakup after she's already suggested alternatives.\n\nHe mentions supporting her emotionally, but deciding to break up because of infertility might come across as not fully supporting her. The fact that he's in a relationship with someone who's tried to find solutions (surrogacy, adoption) while he dismisses them could be a problem. Also, the emotional timing: breaking up right after such a traumatic discovery might be seen as insensitive, even if he's struggling with his feelings.\n\nAnother angle is whether the decision is based on something that can't be changed. Infertility is a medical fact, so if this is a deal-breaker for him, it's a fundamental incompatibility. However, the way he's handling it\u2014considering breaking up immediately instead of exploring other options or counseling\u2014might be where he's at fault. \n\nHe also mentions that he's not sure if he's thinking straight, which could mean he's not making a mature decision. The girlfriend might need time and support, not a breakup. So, even if his reasoning is based on his wants, the timing and method of the breakup could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see his stance as selfish, especially if he's prioritizing his biological needs over her feelings and the relationship they've built. Others might argue that personal values about parenthood are valid. But since he's the one choosing to end the relationship, the responsibility falls on him. If he can't adjust his expectations, maybe it's not fair to her, but if he's honest about his needs, it's a difficult situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while his feelings are genuine, the decision to break up over this, especially without thoroughly exploring alternatives or considering her emotional state, might make him the asshole. So, A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
