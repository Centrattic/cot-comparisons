I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants biological children with her. He loves her but feels conflicted about proceeding without the ability to have their own child.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about expectations, communication, and mutual respect. The author acknowledges that his feelings might sound selfish. The girlfriend has already suggested alternatives, which he hasn't explored further. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners have aligned goals. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for one partner, and the other isn't open to alternatives, that can create a conflict. However, the author is considering breaking up out of love and support, not just because of the infertility. He's also aware that his decision could hurt her, which shows some empathy.\n\nBut is it wrong? Infertility can be a sensitive issue. The author is placing his personal desire for biological children above the relationship. However, it's his personal choice, and he's honest about his feelings. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just if his decision is justified. \n\nOn one hand, he's being honest about his desires and is considering breaking up to not put her through a life he's not fully committed to. On the other hand, it might seem abrupt, and perhaps he hasn't explored all options with her. The fact that he hasn't discussed his stance on adoption and surrogacy in depth with her might be a problem. If he was open to discussing more, maybe they could find a middle ground.\n\nBut the core issue is whether his decision is morally wrong. Since he's acting based on his personal values and is trying to be supportive of her, even if his reasoning is selfish, it's his right to decide what he can and cannot live with. However, breaking up after five years and being engaged could be seen as hurtful, especially if she's relying on him emotionally during this time. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, it's about whether the action was made with consideration for the other person's well-being. The author is considering her by not wanting to leave her, but also considering his own needs. The answer might hinge on whether his decision is fair given their circumstances. Since he hasn't closed the door yet and is seeking advice, it shows he's trying to make a responsible choice.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a difficult decision based on personal values, and while his reasoning may seem selfish, it's part of his honest reflection on their future. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, it's a close call. Another perspective might argue that he should work through this with her instead of breaking up, which could mean A. But the question asks if he's in the wrong. Since he's being honest and considering her feelings, even if the decision is hard, it's not inherently wrong.\n"
