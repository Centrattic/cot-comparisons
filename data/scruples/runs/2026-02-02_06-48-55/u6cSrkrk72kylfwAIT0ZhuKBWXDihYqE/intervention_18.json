I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong after considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for 5 years, both wanted kids, and after a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. The girl suggested adoption or a surrogate, but the guy doesn't want either. He wants his own biological kids and is thinking about breaking up because they can't have them naturally. He loves her but feels like he can't adopt and is conflicted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From one angle, he's being honest about his desires. But on the other hand, breaking up over this might seem selfish, especially since the news is recent and they're both still dealing with the emotional impact. The girlfriend is clearly affected, and he's considering leaving her right after such a big blow. \n\nValues and perspectives matter here. Some people might think that wanting biological children is natural, but others might argue that being willing to adjust (like adoption) is necessary in long-term relationships. The guy dismissed her suggestions (adoption/surrogate) without really engaging in the discussion, which could be seen as not supporting her or considering alternatives together. \n\nAlso, timing is a factor. Breaking up so soon after the diagnosis might be seen as not giving the relationship a chance to adapt. He mentions he's not decided yet, but the fact that he's seriously considering it shows he's not handling it with patience or compassion. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires over the immediate emotional state of his partner and not fully exploring alternatives she suggested. But maybe there's a counterargument that it's his right to set his boundaries. Still, the way he's approaching it seems hasty and possibly selfish, especially given the context.\n"
