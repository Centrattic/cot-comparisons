I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend. They had been trying to have a baby for a year and found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, and he wants to have his own biological kids. He loves her but feels he can't proceed without the possibility of having their own child.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about the factors involved. \n\nBiological child desire is a personal preference. Some people place a high value on having biological children, while others are open to adoption or surrogacy. The author states he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, which are valid feelings. However, the girlfriend has already suggested alternatives, and the author is considering breaking up because he can't accept those options.\n\nThe key here is whether his decision is justified. The author is in a place where his personal desire for biological children is conflicting with his partner's ability to provide them. The girlfriend is clearly affected by this news, and he's acknowledging her emotional state. But his decision to break up is based on his own wants, not her infertility. \n\nIs it selfish to want a biological child? Some might say it's a personal choice and not the author's fault. Others might argue that ending a relationship over infertility could be seen as prioritizing one's own desires over the relationship. However, the author isn't pressuring her; he's stating that he can't go through with adoption or surrogacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. If she's open to alternatives and he's not, it's a significant difference in their priorities. The author isn't forcing her to adopt or use a surrogate; he's expressing his inability to accept those options. In that case, the decision to break up might be seen as necessary for him to find a partner who shares his desire for biological children, but it could also be viewed as abandoning her during a tough time.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. He hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering it. Since he's trying to process his feelings and the situation, it's hard to say he's definitively in the wrong. The decision itself might not be wrong if his reasons are genuine and he's being honest with both himself and his partner.\n\nHowever, the act of breaking up over this could be seen as hurtful, especially since the infertility is her issue, not his. But if he's clear about his needs and they don't align with her willingness to explore alternatives, maybe it's not his fault. It's a tough call because relationships require compromise, but not everyone can compromise on every issue.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on his personal values and desires. While it might be difficult for others to understand, it's his choice. Whether it's right or wrong is subjective, but since he's being honest and considering the situation, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
