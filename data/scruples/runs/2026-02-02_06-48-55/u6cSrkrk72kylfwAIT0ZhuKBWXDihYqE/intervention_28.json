I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is that he's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They had been trying to have a baby, and he wants biological kids. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but he's not into either. He loves her but feels like he can't go through with adoption.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the decision to break up over infertility. The author mentions that he hasn't decided yet but is thinking about it. He's in a 5-year relationship, and she's probably very important to him. He says he wants kids with her, but can't accept adoption or surrogacy. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong for considering this. From the user's perspective, they think the author is wrong. Why? Well, breaking up someone's life over something that might not be a dealbreaker? Maybe there are other ways to handle this. Also, the fact that he's not supporting adoption could be seen as selfish or not considering her feelings. But then again, maybe he's being honest about his own desires. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's okay for him to realize that his ideal family structure doesn't align with his partner's situation. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014considering breaking up right after the diagnosis\u2014might come off as harsh. The girlfriend is clearly more affected by the news, and he's the one considering leaving her in this vulnerable time. That seems a bit selfish. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's the one who wanted kids, but now that the path isn't possible the way he wanted, he's leaving. That might make people see him as the one with a problem. The girlfriend is offering alternatives, but he's not open to them. So, he's not flexible, and that could be where the issue lies. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author hasn't fully discussed his feelings with her yet. He's just thinking aloud here. Maybe if he had a more open conversation with her, they could find a compromise. But the fact that he's contemplating breaking up without even discussing alternatives properly could be seen as wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he says he \"can't change\" his desire for biological children might be a red flag. It shows that he's not willing to adapt for the relationship. Relationships often require compromise, and if one partner's non-negotiable is something that's now out of reach, it's a tough spot. But breaking up over it might be seen as a failure to find another solution together. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is considering breaking up because of his own inability to accept alternatives, which the girlfriend is open to. He's the one who wants kids, but now that the path isn't possible, he's leaving her. That seems to make him the one in the wrong because he's not meeting her halfway and is causing her pain after she's already been through a lot. So, answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
