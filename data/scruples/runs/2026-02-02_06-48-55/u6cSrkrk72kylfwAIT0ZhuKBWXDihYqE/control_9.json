I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They've been together for over five years, they wanted kids, and after a year of trying, they found out she can't have biological children. He's 24, she's 26. He doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, so he's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids. He loves her but feels this is the only way.\n\nI need to consider if his reaction is justified. On one hand, he's clearly emotional and stressed. He says he wants his own kids with his partner. On the other hand, the decision to break up over infertility could be seen as selfish, especially since the problem isn't his. He mentions she suggested alternatives, which he rejected without engaging further. \n\nInfertility can be a tough issue in relationships. Some people place a high value on having biological children. But walking away immediately might hurt her deeply, especially since she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e. The question is whether his reason is valid. \n\nHe acknowledges it sounds selfish, which is an important self-awareness point. However, the decision to end a relationship is personal. But is it fair to break up solely over something beyond her control? Also, he hasn't given adoption or surrogacy much thought, which might affect their future together.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. If he's being honest about his values and not wanting to compromise, maybe he's not the \"asshole,\" but ending the relationship immediately might be seen as insensitive. The community might debate this, but considering he's in a difficult situation and trying to process his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the immediate consideration to break up could be seen as not supporting her during a tough time. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because the problem isn't her fault, and breaking up over infertility can be seen as not supporting her. But others might say it's his choice if he's clear about his desires. The dilemma is between personal desires vs. staying for love. Since he's the one who wants kids and not open to alternatives, maybe he's in the wrong for not trying other options. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a tough call. Alternatively, maybe he's not wrong if his feelings are genuine, but the way he's handling it is harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if his choice is understandable. If the community sees his action as selfish, then A. If they see it as a valid choice, then B. I need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
