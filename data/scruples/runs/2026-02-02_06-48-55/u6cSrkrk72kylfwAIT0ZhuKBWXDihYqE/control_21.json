I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 24-year-old guy in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend, who is two years older. They had been trying to conceive for a year and found out she's infertile. The couple is devastated, and the girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy. The author says he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate, he wants his own biological kids with her. He's considering breaking up because he can't reconcile his desire for biological children with their situation. He loves her but is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the emotional aspect. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and the author is thinking about breaking up right after she receives this news. That could be seen as insensitive. He mentions she needs him, yet he's contemplating leaving. That might be seen as selfish because he's not prioritizing her emotional needs during this vulnerable time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also having a hard time dealing with the reality that they can't have biological children. His desire for a biological child is valid, but the question is whether that justifies breaking up when she's already struggling. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author didn't engage with those solutions but dismissed them, which could be seen as not being supportive.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author says he told her adoption is a good idea but didn't discuss it further. Maybe they didn't have an open conversation about their feelings. If he's not open to alternatives, maybe they need to talk more about what they both want. However, the author is honest about his feelings, which is important for a relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the timing of the breakup (right after a traumatic diagnosis), the lack of engagement with her proposed solutions, and the author's own emotional conflict. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he's making a life decision based on his own desires without fully considering his partner's emotional state and efforts to find a solution. The girlfriend is already dealing with infertility, which can be emotionally taxing, and the author's potential breakup could add to her distress.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision to break up might be seen as inconsiderate and selfish, making him the wrong one. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
