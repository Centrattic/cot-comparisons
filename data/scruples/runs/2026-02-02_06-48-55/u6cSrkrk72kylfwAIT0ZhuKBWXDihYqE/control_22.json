I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because they don't want adoption or surrogacy. They want biological kids with her, but it's not possible. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together over five years, both 24 and 26. They were trying for a baby for a year. The woman is infertile, and the man is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't move past the infertility. \n\nInfertility is a sensitive issue. While the woman might have been expecting the possibility of alternative routes, the man's stance is that he doesn't want to pursue those options. His reasoning is that he wants his own biological child with his partner. However, the woman's fertility doesn't mean the man can't have children biologically. Wait, the woman is infertile, so surrogacy would require her egg and a surrogate. Adoption is another option. But the man is against those. So essentially, he wants a biological child from the woman, which isn't possible, so he's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it fair to end the relationship over this? It's a personal decision, but the woman is likely to feel hurt and rejected. The man is prioritizing his desire for biological children over the relationship he claims to love. However, he does acknowledge her need for support post-breakup. \n\nThe man's perspective is that he can't compromise. But relationships often require compromise. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe the relationship wasn't viable if that's a deal-breaker. However, the woman might have expected that if they were considering marriage, he would have considered alternatives. \n\nThe key question is whether the man is being selfish. He admits it's selfish but believes it's his true feeling. From an ethical angle, the woman's emotional well-being is at stake. Ending the relationship after this revelation could be seen as cruel, especially if she was counting on him for support. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that his stance is outdated, valuing biological children over the relationship. Others might empathize with his personal desires. But the woman is in a vulnerable state, and breaking up might exacerbate her distress. \n\nThe man is considering breaking up, not out of anger or betrayal, but because of his personal values. However, the timing and the reason might make him the asshole. The woman is already dealing with infertility, a significant blow. To then lose her partner could be seen as adding insult to injury. \n\nIn the WIBTA context, the community often looks at whether the person is being fair, respectful, and considerate. The man is honest about his feelings but may not be considering the emotional impact on his partner. Even though he's not in a wrong based on his own values, the way he's handling it could be seen as wrong because of the emotional toll on her. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desires over his partner's emotional state during a vulnerable time, even if his feelings are genuine.\n"
