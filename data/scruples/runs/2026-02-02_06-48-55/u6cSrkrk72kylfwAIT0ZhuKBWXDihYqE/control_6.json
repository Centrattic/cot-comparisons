I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together for over five years, planning for kids. The guy is 24, she's 26. They were close to getting engaged. The woman suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the man doesn't want those options. He feels it's important for the child to be biologically theirs. Now, he's thinking of breaking up, even though he loves her, because he can't imagine not having his own biological kids.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships are complex, and personal values play a big role. The key here is that he's making a decision based on his own desires, which might not align with his partner's. But she's already offered alternatives, which he's rejecting. That seems to prioritize his own needs over hers, especially when she's the one facing the infertility. \n\nInfertility can be traumatic, and his reaction might be seen as adding emotional harm. He mentions she's devastated and needs support, but considering a breakup might be seen as abandoning her during a tough time. Even if he loves her, breaking up over this could be hurtful. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's being honest about his feelings and not wanting to compromise. But given the context, it's his partner who is infertile, and he's the one with the choice to consider alternatives. His refusal to consider adoption or surrogacy might be seen as selfish, especially since he's the one who gets to continue his biological line through other means if he's single. \n\nAlso, wanting biological children is a personal choice, but in a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. If he can't accept her alternatives, it's a problem. The question is whether ending the relationship is the right choice. Many might say it's not, because he's choosing his preference over her willingness to find solutions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's rejecting the solutions she's proposed and considering leaving her when she's already struggling with the news. It seems more about his personal desire than a mutual decision. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
