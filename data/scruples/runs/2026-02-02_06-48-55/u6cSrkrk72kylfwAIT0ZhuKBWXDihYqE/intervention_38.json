I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been trying to have a baby for almost a year. They found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy; he wants to have biological children. He loves her and says she's the love of his life, but he's struggling with the idea of not having their own child. He's thinking of breaking up but is unsure if he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. Infertility can be a significant issue for couples planning to have children. The author's stance is that he wants biological children with his current partner, but since that's not possible, he's considering leaving. The question is whether this makes him an asshole.\n\nHe mentions supporting each other after the diagnosis, which is positive. He's trying to be there for her. But his main issue is not accepting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. The problem is that he's not open to other options, which could be a deal-breaker for him. However, is it fair to end a long-term relationship over this, especially when the infertility isn't the girlfriend's fault? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships require compromise. If one partner's fundamental desire (having biological children) can't be met through natural means, they might need to adjust their expectations. The girlfriend is already suggesting adoption or surrogacy, showing she's trying to find a solution. The author's refusal to consider those options could be seen as selfish because he's placing his personal desires above his partner's feelings and their existing relationship. \n\nHe also acknowledges that his thoughts might sound selfish, which indicates he's aware of the potential moral implications. The fact that he's considering breaking up after a long-term relationship might be seen as harsh, especially given the emotional toll the infertility news has on his girlfriend. He's worried about her needing him, which shows empathy, but his decision is based on his own inability to accept alternatives.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his feelings and isn't pretending to be okay with adoption if he's not. But the key question is whether his priorities are justified. If having biological children is non-negotiable for him, then perhaps ending the relationship isn't the wrong choice, but it's definitely a difficult one. However, if he could adjust his expectations or if the relationship is more important than that specific desire, then breaking up might be the selfish act.\n\nAnother angle: the author is 24, and they were planning to get engaged. Maybe they haven't discussed their long-term plans about having children in depth before. If this is a recent development, maybe they need more time to process and explore options together instead of rushing to a breakup. But he's saying he's been thinking about it seriously, so he might have thought it through.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. However, choosing to end a relationship because you can't compromise on having biological children, especially when alternatives are available, might make him the asshole. It's about whether he's being selfish by not considering other paths to parenthood and the emotional impact on his partner. Since he's not open to the options she's suggesting, and the decision is based on his own desires despite knowing the impact, it's likely he's in the wrong.\n"
