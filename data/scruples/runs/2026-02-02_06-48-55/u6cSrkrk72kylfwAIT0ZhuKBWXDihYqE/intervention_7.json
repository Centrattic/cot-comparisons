I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. They went for testing, and she's infertile. The author is 24, she's 26. They were about to get engaged. Now, he's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He feels selfish but can't change his desire to have a biological child with her. He's conflicted between his love for her and his personal wish for biological kids.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for considering the breakup. He's honest about his feelings, which is important. He mentions that he's been supportive and that they've been dealing with the news. But he's also clear that adoption and surrogacy aren't options for him. The question is whether it's wrong to break up over this.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. In relationships, both partners' values and desires matter. If having biological children is a core value for the author, and he's transparent about it now, maybe it's not wrong. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also crucial. After the shock of infertility, she's suggested alternatives, which he dismissed. He's not engaging with her ideas, just stating his preferences without considering other possibilities or her feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. Breaking up after she's been through a major emotional trauma (learning she's infertile) could be seen as selfish. She needs support, and he's considering leaving for a reason that might not be as pressing as he thinks. Also, he's not sure about his decision yet, just considering options. That might indicate he's not fully processing the situation.\n\nBut then, relationships require compromise. If his desire for biological children is non-negotiable and hers is too (she's okay with adoption), maybe the incompatibility is real. However, he hasn't explored the alternatives she's proposed. He's quick to dismiss adoption, not explaining why. Maybe there's a middle ground or other solutions they haven't discussed.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no wrong here per se, but morally, it's tricky. The author is being truthful about his feelings, which is good. But he's not showing a willingness to work through the problem. It's possible he's using the infertility as an excuse for his own unresolved feelings or fears. The question is whether his desire for biological children is valid or if he's being inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be the \"asshole\" because he's honest, but he's also not engaging with his partner's suggestions and is making a snap judgment based on current emotions. He needs to consider if his stance is fixed or if he's open to other methods. Since he's not sure yet, maybe taking more time to reflect is better than rushing into a breakup.\n"
