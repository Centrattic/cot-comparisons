I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and they're considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They love her but feel that they can't have their own biological kids with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether choosing to end the relationship over infertility is wrong. The author is in a five-year relationship, and they had been planning to get married. They mention that they want their own biological kids, and since adoption/surrogacy aren't options for them, they think breaking up is the only solution.\n\nI should think about the implications. Infertility can be a sensitive topic. The girlfriend is already going through a tough time, and the author is considering adding the emotional weight of a breakup. The author acknowledges that their reasoning might sound selfish, which is a red flag. The girlfriend might feel that the breakup is more about the author's inability to adjust to the situation rather than her infertility itself.\n\nAlso, there's a power dynamic here. The author is the one deciding to break up because of their own desires, even though they say they love her. It could be seen as not being fully supportive during her time of need. The girlfriend was about to be engaged, so this decision could be a betrayal after a significant commitment step.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is honest about their feelings. They're not in denial about wanting biological kids. Maybe some would argue that it's their right to be honest about their values. However, breaking up during such a vulnerable time might be seen as heartless.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal perspectives. In some cultures, having biological children is highly valued, and others may prioritize the relationship over that. But in many places, people are becoming more accepting of alternative family structures. However, the author isn't open to those alternatives, which limits their options.\n\nThe author's support for the girlfriend is mentioned, but the decision to break up could undermine that support. It's possible that the relationship could have been salvaged with counseling or exploring other paths together. Ending it because of a personal limitation without trying alternatives could be seen as selfish.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The breakup is being considered right after the infertility diagnosis, which might not give enough time to process and find solutions. The author might not be thinking clearly, as they mentioned themselves. That could indicate that the decision is impulsive rather than well-considered.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is honest about their feelings, the timing and the way they're approaching the situation might be seen as inconsiderate and selfish. The girlfriend is already dealing with a major life challenge, and adding a breakup could be devastating. The fact that the author is the one deciding to end things despite claiming to love her suggests they might be in the wrong.\n"
