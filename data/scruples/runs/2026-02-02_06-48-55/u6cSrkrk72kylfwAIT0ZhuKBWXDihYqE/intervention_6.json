I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, trying to have a baby for a year, tested and found she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't move forward without having his own biological child with her. He's conflicted between supporting her and his own desires.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about different angles. On one hand, making a life decision based purely on infertility could be seen as selfish, especially if his partner is willing to consider alternatives. Infertility is a medical issue, not a personal failing, so using that as a reason to break up might be harsh. Also, their future plans involved having kids, so this is a major obstacle. But he's young, 24, and maybe hasn't fully considered other options yet. However, his stance is that he can't adopt or use a surrogate, so his options are limited. \n\nBut wait, is it his responsibility to consider alternatives? His partner is offering solutions, but he's rejecting them. That could be seen as not being supportive. Also, the emotional impact on his girlfriend is significant. They were about to get engaged, so this would add to her emotional pain. \n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his feelings. He's not pretending to be okay with adoption if he isn't. It's important in a relationship to be truthful about such major life goals. If he truly can't accept alternatives, maybe the break-up is about his personal values, not just her infertility. \n\nBut is it fair to break up over this? Relationships often require compromise. If one partner can't compromise on a key issue, maybe they are in the wrong for not being flexible. However, if having biological children is non-negotiable for him, then maybe it's a valid reason. \n\nI need to consider cultural and personal values. Some people strongly value biological children. Others prioritize being a family through other means. The author is being honest, but the timing might be insensitive, given she's already devastated. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own biological child want over his partner's willingness to explore other options. However, if he's genuine in his inability to adopt, it's a real conflict. \n\nBut in relationships, dealing with major issues like infertility requires both parties to adjust. His reaction could be seen as self-centered, not considering her feelings. So, leaning towards A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance. Maybe the answer is A because he's using her infertility as a reason to end things despite her offers to adapt.\n"
