I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get married. They wanted kids, tried for a year, and found out the girlfriend is infertile. The guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels he can't proceed without being able to have their own biological child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From the guy's perspective, he's clear that he wants biological children with his partner. But the reality is that due to her infertility, that's not possible. He's contemplating a breakup because he's not open to other options. Now, is that selfish or not?\n\nOn one hand, his desire for biological children is valid. People have different priorities in relationships. But on the other hand, he's been supportive of her during this tough time. The key here is communication. Did he fully explore other possibilities with her? He mentioned she suggested adoption and surrogacy, and he agreed but didn't elaborate. However, he doesn't want to adopt, which is a valid personal choice. But he's considering breaking up because he can't compromise on this issue. \n\nThe bigger issue is whether ending the relationship because of infertility is fair. Infertility isn't a choice, so if the primary reason for the breakup is something beyond their control, that could be seen as the guy putting his personal desires above the relationship. However, if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then he's being honest about his limits. \n\nBut here's the catch: he hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice. He's in a dilemma between his love for her and his personal beliefs. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he breaks up, does that make him an asshole? Well, if he truly can't accept alternative paths to parenthood, it's a matter of personal values. However, since the infertility is not her fault, ending the relationship over it might be seen as unfair, especially if he's been supportive so far. \n\nBut again, it's about mutual goals. If they can't align on this core issue, it might not be a relationship that works long-term. The guy is being honest about his stance, which is important. However, the timing and approach matter. He's considering this after she's been through a traumatic experience, which could add emotional weight to the situation. \n\nIn the WIBTA context, people often weigh emotional impact versus personal principles. If he breaks up, some might say he's being selfish, while others might say it's honest. Given that he's not decided yet and is seeking advice, the answer might hinge on whether his reasoning is considered selfish. The key point is that he's not willing to compromise on adoption or surrogacy, which are valid options for many people. If he can't support those, then his stance is clear, but it's also limiting.\n"
