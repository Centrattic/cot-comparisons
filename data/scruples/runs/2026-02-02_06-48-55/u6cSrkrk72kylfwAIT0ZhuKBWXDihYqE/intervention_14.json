I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants biological kids, and he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her, but he's thinking about ending the relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for five years, and they wanted kids. The girlfriend is infertile, and the author is struggling with the idea of not having biological children. He's considering breaking up because he can't adjust to adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, breaking up someone because they can't have biological children could be seen as selfish. The author is prioritizing his desire for his own biological children over the relationship. However, it's also important to note that having children is a significant life decision, and people have different non-negotiables. The author is honest about his feelings, but is it fair to end the relationship because of this?\n\nOn one hand, the author is upfront about his needs. Relationships should be built on mutual understanding and shared goals. If having biological kids is non-negotiable for him, maybe the relationship wasn't compatible in that aspect. But on the other hand, the girlfriend is already offering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which the author dismisses. That could be seen as not considering her feelings or willingness to adapt.\n\nThe author mentions that he loves her deeply and doesn't want to hurt her, which shows he's empathetic. However, the decision to break up after the news is still a big deal. The girlfriend might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility, which is a sensitive issue. Infertility can affect both partners, and it's important to approach it with support, not as a deal-breaker.\n\nThere's a balance between personal desires and commitment in a relationship. If the author truly can't consider adoption or surrogacy, then maybe the relationship isn't viable for him. But the way he's framing it\u2014considering breaking up after supporting each other through the news\u2014might be seen as not fully committed to working through the challenges together. \n\nAlso, the societal pressure to have biological children plays a role here. But in modern relationships, many people are open to other options. If the author is unwilling to consider those, it's a personal choice, but it's also a valid reason for him to walk away. However, he needs to consider if his reasons are selfish or if they stem from genuine, unchangeable preferences.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is complicated. He's in a difficult situation where his personal desires conflict with the reality of his partner's infertility. The key factors are whether he's being honest about his needs and whether he's considering his partner's feelings. Since he's not forcing her to adopt or use a surrogate and is respecting her suggestions, maybe it's not the wrong choice. But if he's breaking up solely because of biological children, it could be seen as the wrong decision, especially if he's not considering alternative paths that she's willing to take.\n"
