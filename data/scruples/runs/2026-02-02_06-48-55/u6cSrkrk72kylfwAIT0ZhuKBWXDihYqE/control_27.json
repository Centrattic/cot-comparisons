I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend found out she's infertile. They were planning to have kids, and now he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants to have kids naturally, and since that's not possible, he's thinking of leaving her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple has been together for over five years and was planning to get married. The woman's infertility is a major factor here. The man is feeling conflicted because he can't reconcile his desire for biological children with the options they've discussed. He's not being cruel, he says he loves her, but he's struggling with his own feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Infertility can be a significant issue for some people. It's not uncommon for it to cause stress in relationships. However, the key points here are communication and mutual expectations. Did they discuss their priorities before this issue came up? If they were planning to have kids and both were on the same page, then the infertility is an external factor. But the author's stance is that he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, which are alternatives. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not decided yet, just considering options. He supports her emotionally but is struggling with his own needs. The girlfriend suggested adoption, he agreed but doesn't really want it. Is it selfish? Some might argue that his desire for biological children is valid, but he's choosing to walk away from a loving partner because she can't meet that need. Others might say that he should have considered this earlier, maybe they didn't have enough discussions about family planning. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact. The girlfriend is likely more affected by the infertility (as it's her infertility) and he's contemplating a breakup, which adds to her stress. Even though he says he wants to support her, the thought of breaking up might be seen as adding insult to injury. However, if not having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then he might not be able to stay in a happy relationship.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no right or wrong here, but socially, people might judge him for being selfish. But others might empathize, thinking that he's being honest about his needs. The key is whether the decision is made after thorough discussion and mutual understanding. If they hadn't talked about alternatives before, then the author's reaction is based on his personal values. If they had discussed it and she knew his feelings, maybe it's different. But based on the given info, it's unclear if prior discussions happened.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. If he's being honest about his feelings and they can't find a compromise, maybe it's not his fault. But considering the timing and the emotional state of his partner, some might think he's not being considerate enough. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because terminating the relationship over something beyond her control, especially when she's already struggling, might be seen as harsh. But others might say it's not his fault if he can't compromise.\n"
