I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be a [You Know What]) story is in the wrong. The author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He loves her but doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate because he wants his own biological children. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author wants kids, and the main issue is the inability to have biological children. The girlfriend has suggested alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, but he's not open to those. He's thinking about breaking up despite loving her. \n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing his personal preference. He's clear that he wants biological children, which is a valid desire. However, the girlfriend has offered solutions, and his rejection of those options might be where he's at fault. If he's unwilling to compromise, that could be seen as selfish, especially after she's already proposed alternatives. \n\nAlso, timing matters. They had been trying for a year and decided to check, so they were committed to having a child together. The fact that he's considering breaking up after this news might indicate that his commitment to the relationship is conditional on being able to have biological kids. That could be seen as not being fully committed to the relationship if other options are available. \n\nInfertility is a significant issue and can affect both partners emotionally. The author mentions supporting each other, but his unwillingness to consider adoption or surrogacy might be a deal-breaker for him. However, if the relationship was built on wanting biological children together, and that's no longer possible, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nBut then, relationships also require compromise. If he's not open to any alternatives, it's possible he's putting his own desires above her feelings. The fact that he loves her but still can't move past this might mean he's not considering her needs or the emotional impact of breaking up after such a revelation. \n\nI think the key here is whether his decision is based on a fundamental incompatibility or personal selfishness. If having biological children is non-negotiable and he's unwilling to explore any other options, then maybe he is in the wrong because he's not meeting her halfway. But if he genuinely believes that he can't be a good parent through adoption or surrogacy, then it's a matter of personal values. \n\nHowever, in most cases, relationships require compromise. The fact that the girlfriend has already suggested alternatives and he dismisses them without discussion might make him the one at fault. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her suggestions and is prioritizing his own wishes over the relationship's future.\n"
