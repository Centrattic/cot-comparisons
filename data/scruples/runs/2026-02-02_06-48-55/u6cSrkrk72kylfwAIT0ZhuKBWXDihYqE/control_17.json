I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend found out she's infertile. They wanted kids, they tried for a year, and now they can't have biological children. The author is considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He loves her a lot, but he can't imagine wanting to adopt, and he feels like it's important for the kids to be biologically theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together five years, and he's 24, she's 26. They were planning to get married. The fact that they were already planning a family is important. The author is honest about his feelings, even though he knows they might sound selfish. He's struggling with the idea of not having biological kids with her. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, it's a personal decision, but there are ethical considerations. Breaking up because of infertility might be seen as cruel, especially right after the news. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, and he's considering leaving her during her emotional low. That could be seen as insensitive. \n\nHowever, he also mentions that he's considering all options and hasn't made a decision yet. He's trying to be honest with himself about his feelings. He does love her and says he doesn't want to hurt her. But his desire for biological children is a key factor for him. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that it's selfish to break up over infertility when there are alternatives like adoption or surrogacy. But others might say that if having biological children is non-negotiable for the person, then it's understandable, even if it's painful. However, the author is framing his decision as something he can't change, but maybe he's not fully exploring the emotional impact on his partner. \n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice might suggest he's in a vulnerable place, not necessarily malicious. The problem is whether his reasoning is valid. If he can't support adoption or surrogacy, then his desire for biological kids is a deal-breaker for him. However, ending the relationship after such a significant commitment (5 years, engagement plans) could be seen as breaking his promises or commitments, especially if the infertility was unexpected. \n\nAnother angle is that infertility isn't the woman's fault. It's a medical condition, not a personal failing. So, using it as a reason to leave might be harsh. The author is in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong? It depends on the cultural or moral standards. In some views, it's a personal choice, but in others, it's considered abandoning someone in a time of need. \n\nI think the key points are: his honesty about his feelings is commendable, but the timing and context of the breakup could be seen as cruel. The girlfriend is already devastated, and breaking up soon after might compound her pain. The author might not be in the wrong from his own perspective, but from an external standpoint, especially considering the support she needs, it could be seen as wrong. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong), because breaking up over this without considering the emotional impact on her and the alternatives available might be selfish, even if his feelings are genuine.\n"
