I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple found out the girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because they want biological children and don't want adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were about to get engaged. They wanted kids, and now the main issue is infertility. The author is struggling with the idea of not being able to have biological children and is considering breaking up because they can't accept adoption or surrogacy. The girlfriend has already suggested alternatives, but he's not open to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's stance on wanting biological children, the sudden decision to break up, the emotional impact on his girlfriend, and whether his reasoning is selfish or not. The user feels the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it objectively.\n\nInfertility can be a sensitive issue. The author mentions he's supporting his girlfriend, but the fact that he's considering leaving right after this discovery might be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional blow, and he's adding the pressure of a potential breakup. Even though he says he loves her, the timing of considering a breakup might be too soon. People process such news differently, and rushing into a decision without giving time to adjust could be harsh.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he wants biological kids and can't adopt. That's a personal preference, but it's important to consider whether this is a deal-breaker for him. If he had communicated this earlier, maybe they could have planned differently. However, since they were already trying for a year, maybe they were both aware of the possibility of infertility. But bringing up the possibility of a breakup so soon after the diagnosis might be seen as not giving enough time to explore alternatives together.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional support. The author says he's been there for her, but the idea of breaking up right after the news could undermine that support. It might be necessary to explore counseling or more time to discuss options. The girlfriend might need more time to process, and the author's consideration of breaking up might be premature.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some might see his stance as selfish because he's prioritizing his biological child desire over the relationship. Others might understand his perspective if having biological children is a non-negotiable for him. However, relationships require compromise, and if he can't compromise on this, it might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nThe key is whether breaking up after such a traumatic event is the right move. The author hasn't decided yet, but the mere consideration might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's not giving his partner time to recover emotionally and mentally. The question is whether he's in the wrong for considering this, not necessarily if the breakup is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the timing and approach might be seen as inconsiderate. He hasn't given enough time for both of them to adjust to the news, and the fact that he's thinking about breaking up right after the diagnosis could be viewed as not being supportive enough. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the consensus in such forums often leans towards considering the emotional impact, so A might be the answer.\n"
