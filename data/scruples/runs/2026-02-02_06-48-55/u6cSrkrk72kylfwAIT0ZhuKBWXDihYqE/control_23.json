I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who posted the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat [or Asshole]) thread is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for over five years, and they wanted to have kids. After a year of trying, they found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He says he wants his own kids with his own woman, implying he wants her to carry the child, which she can't. He loves her but is thinking about ending the relationship because of this.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) His reason for considering a breakup is the inability to have biological children, which is outside of either of their control. 2) He acknowledges that this is a big deal for her and that she's devastated. 3) He's considering breaking up not because of something she did wrong, but because of a medical condition. 4) He's conflicted, supporting her but also feeling that he can't compromise on wanting biological children.\n\nI need to evaluate whether his actions are justified or if he's being selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nOn one hand, infertility is a medical issue, not a personal failing. The girlfriend is not at fault here. The fact that they wanted children together and now can't have them biologically might be a dealbreaker for some people. He's honest about his feelings but is this a valid reason to break up? If someone's core desire for biological children is non-negotiable, maybe it's fair for him to realize that this is a problem in the relationship, even if it's not her fault. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up after five years because of something that wasn't her fault could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend is already dealing with emotional trauma from the infertility diagnosis. If the man is breaking up because he doesn't want to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, even though those are viable options, is that selfish? He says he doesn't want to adopt, but is it fair to end the relationship rather than try those options? Also, he's the one who suggested moving on, which could be hurtful to her during a vulnerable time.\n\nBut from his perspective, maybe he's being honest with himself. If he truly can't adopt and wants biological children, staying might not be fair to him either. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Public opinion on these forums often leans towards valuing commitment and support through challenges. People might say that he's being inconsiderate by wanting to leave her after she's already been through trauma. But others might say that if having biological kids is a non-negotiable, it's realistic to part ways.\n\nI also need to consider the moral implications. Is it wrong to end a relationship over something that isn't the partner's fault? Or is it about personal values and whether both partners can adjust their desires? The man is not cheating or being negligent; he's facing a conflict between his personal desires and the reality of the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a tough call. But in many cases, people might view the man as making a selfish decision, especially since he's leaving his partner during a hard time. However, others might empathize with his stance on wanting biological children. But given the context that it's his decision to leave when she's already suffering, the consensus might lean towards him being the asshole. So the answer might be A.\n"
