I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is that they tried for a baby for a year and found out she can't have kids. The guy says he wants his own kids with his partner, not adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and emotional aspects here. The girlfriend is clearly hurt, and the guy is conflicted. He says he loves her but can't move past the infertility. Is it selfish to want biological children? Well, some people value having biological kids, but others might adjust to adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether the author's reasoning is justified.\n\nHe hasn't decided yet, but he's thinking about breaking up because his desire for biological children can't be fulfilled. The girlfriend might feel rejected or blamed. The author is honest about his feelings, which is good, but the act of breaking up over this could be seen as wrong because it's putting his wants above her feelings, especially after she suggested alternatives like adoption.\n\nBut on the other hand, if not having biological children is a deal-breaker for him, maybe it's honest to end the relationship before they get deeper into it. However, breaking up right after such a traumatic discovery might be seen as insensitive. He mentions she's been supportive, and he doesn't want to hurt her more. Yet, the decision to break up could be traumatic for her.\n\nI need to think about societal norms. Some might say that wanting your own biological child is reasonable, but others might argue that a real relationship should overcome such obstacles. The author is being upfront, but is it the right time? Maybe they need more time to process and explore other options together.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she's already suggested adoption, which shows she's trying to work through this. If the author is not open to that, he's closing the door on solutions she's willing to accept. This could be seen as not compromising. So, he might be in the wrong for not considering her options and for considering a breakup so soon after the discovery.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is honest about his feelings, the timing and the approach might be problematic. Breaking up over infertility could be seen as selfish, especially if the partner is willing to explore alternatives. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
