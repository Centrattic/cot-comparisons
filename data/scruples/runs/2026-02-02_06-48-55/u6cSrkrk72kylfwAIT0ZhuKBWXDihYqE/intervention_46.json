I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple had been trying to have a baby for a year and got tested. The girlfriend is infertile, which is a big deal for them. They've been together five years, and they were planning to get engaged. Now, he's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants his own biological kids. He says he loves her but can't get past this. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, ending a long-term relationship over infertility could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend is already suggested alternatives, which he dismissed. He's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the relationship. But some might argue that having kids is a significant life decision, and if it's non-negotiable, maybe it's fair. However, breaking up during a time when she's going through a traumatic experience feels harsh. Also, the fact that he hasn't made up his mind yet but is considering it adds complexity. \n\nI think the key points are: supporting each other during tough times, the importance of open communication, and whether this is a deal-breaker. Since he hasn't decided yet, maybe there's space for discussion. But if he values a biological child so much that he can't stay in the relationship, it's a personal choice, but it might be seen as callous to end it right after the news when she's vulnerable. So, leaning towards A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some people would say it's not his fault for having his own preferences.\n"
