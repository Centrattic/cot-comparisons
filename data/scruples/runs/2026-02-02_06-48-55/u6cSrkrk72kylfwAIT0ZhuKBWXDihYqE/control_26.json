I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile. They were trying to have kids for a year and decided to get checked. The main issue is that the author wants biological kids with their partner but doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. The girlfriend suggested those options, but the author isn't into it, leading them to consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is 24, the girlfriend is 26. They've been together five years. The author mentions that he loves her and she's the love of his life, but he can't let go of the desire for biological children. He's considering breaking up because he can't imagine adopting or using a surrogate. He feels conflicted because he supports her but can't see a future with her without having his own biological child.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, wanting to have biological children is a personal choice. It's his right to want that. However, the girlfriend is infertile, so it's not possible through natural means. She offered alternatives, which he dismissed. But he's not considering those alternatives, leading to the thought of breaking up.\n\nBut here's the thing: is it fair to break up over this? The author says he loves her but can't move past this. Is he being selfish? The girlfriend is probably already hurting from the infertility diagnosis. Adding a breakup on top of that could be seen as heartless. He mentions he doesn't want to put her through a breakup, but still considering it. That might indicate he's not fully considering her feelings in the moment.\n\nAlso, the author says he can't adopt or use a surrogate. But is that a valid reason to end the relationship? Maybe he's not thinking about other possibilities. For example, maybe the couple could work through this together, even without biological children. Or maybe he could change his mind over time. By immediately thinking of breaking up, he's closing the door without exploring all options.\n\nAnother angle: the decision to have kids is a big life choice. If having biological children is non-negotiable for him, then perhaps they aren't compatible on this fundamental issue. But he's the one who's bringing up the breakup. The girlfriend might be open to alternatives, and he's not willing to consider them, which could be seen as not being fair to her.\n\nBut then again, if his personal values and desires can't be compromised, is it fair for him to stay in a relationship where that's not possible? It's a tough call. Some might argue that he's being honest with himself and his needs, while others might see it as abandoning her during a vulnerable time.\n\nThe community's view on these kinds of situations often leans towards considering the emotional impact. Breaking up after such news could be seen as selfish, especially if he's the one initiating it. The girlfriend might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility. On the other hand, if he truly can't move past this, staying together might lead to ongoing unhappiness for both.\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) context, the question is whether the author is the asshole for considering breaking up over this. The key factors are intent and impact. He's trying to be honest but is it at the expense of his partner's feelings? Since he's the one who's the primary person bringing up the breakup, even if he's conflicted, the action of breaking up after she's already struggling might be seen as the asshole move.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). He's not willing to consider alternatives she's suggested, and breaking up over this could be seen as selfish and potentially hurtful, especially given her current emotional state. However, there's some nuance because he's honest about his desires. But the timing and the emotional context make his potential actions look more like he's in the wrong.\n"
