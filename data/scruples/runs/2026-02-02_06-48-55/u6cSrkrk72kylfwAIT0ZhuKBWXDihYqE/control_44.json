I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the scenario. The couple has been together for over five years and were considering marriage. They decided to check their fertility after a year of trying, and it turned out the girlfriend is infertile. The author is 24, and his girlfriend is 26. The author is struggling with the idea of not having biological children, even though his girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy. He's considering a breakup because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate and feels that he wants his own biological child with the woman he's with.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, relationships are built on mutual respect and understanding. The author is being honest about his feelings and his desire for biological children, which is a personal and valid stance. However, the act of considering a breakup based on infertility can be seen as problematic, especially if it's the only dealbreaker in the relationship. It's important to consider that the girlfriend might feel that her inability to conceive is being used as a reason to end the relationship, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not making the decision lightly. He mentions that he hasn't decided yet and is considering all options. He also states that he loves her and doesn't want to hurt her. However, his stance on adoption and surrogacy being non-negotiable might be seen as inflexible. It's possible that the author hasn't fully explored compromises or communicated his feelings effectively. The girlfriend might feel that her suggestions (adoption/surrogacy) are being dismissed, which could lead to feelings of rejection.\n\nAnother angle is the societal pressure and personal values. Some people place a high value on having biological children, and it's not uncommon for this to be a significant factor in relationships. However, using infertility as a reason to break up could be seen as selfish or heartless, especially if the relationship was stable otherwise. The author's age (24) might also play a role, as he's young and still figuring out what he wants in life, which could mean his priorities are not set in stone.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being considerate of his partner's feelings and whether he's open to alternative solutions. Since he's considering breaking up, it might be that he's not willing to adapt his desires to the current situation, which could be seen as prioritizing his own needs over the relationship. However, if the inability to have biological children is a non-negotiable for him, then his decision isn't entirely wrong from his perspective, even if it's painful for his partner.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a morally complex situation. While his feelings are valid, using infertility as a reason to break up could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the relationship had other strengths. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and individual values. However, given that the author hasn't finalized the decision and is seeking advice, it's possible that he's being honest and is not entirely in the wrong, but he might need to reflect more on his stance and communication with his partner.\n"
