I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after she found out she's infertile. They had been trying to have a baby for a year and both got tested. The girlfriend suggested adoption or surrogacy, but the author doesn't want either and wants his own biological kids. He's considering breaking up because he can't imagine adopting, even though he loves her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether prioritizing biological children over staying in a relationship is selfish or wrong. The author is in a 5-year relationship, and the girlfriend is about to be his fianc\u00e9e. The author acknowledges that he might sound selfish but feels it's how he is. The question is if he's in the wrong for considering breaking up over this.\n\nI should think about the ethical implications. Relationships require compromise. If one person's inability to adopt makes them want to end the relationship, is that fair? The girlfriend is the one who can't have biological kids, and the author is the one who can't accept alternatives. The author's reasoning is that he wants his own kids with his own woman, which he phrased as wanting \"our kid.\" But since she can't provide that biologically, he's considering leaving.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his desires and not wanting to fake it. On the other hand, it might be seen as abandoning someone during a difficult time. The girlfriend is already devastated, and the author is considering leaving her after she's gone through this. That could be seen as cruel or insensitive.\n\nAnother angle: the author says he hasn't decided yet but is considering it. Is it wrong to think about leaving because of this? Or is it about whether the decision itself is wrong. If he does break up, is he the asshole? The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just thinking about it.\n\nAlso, societal views on parenthood vary. Some people value biological children very highly, others see parenthood as possible through adoption. The author's stance might be seen as traditional or selfish. However, he does express love and support for his girlfriend, but the decision to leave because of infertility could be seen as a deal-breaker for him. But is it fair to the girlfriend who is already dealing with the emotional pain of infertility?\n\nThe author mentions he's \"not thinking straight,\" which might indicate he's not making a rational decision. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, but he dismissed them without exploring further. Maybe he hasn't considered other options like surrogacy, which might be more feasible than adoption. But he says he doesn't want a surrogate either. So his main issue is not wanting to adopt or use a surrogate. If he can't accept either, then the only solution is to end the relationship.\n\nBut is it fair to end the relationship because of something beyond her control? Infertility isn't her fault. The author is choosing his biological children over the relationship, which could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over their existing bond and future together. That could be considered selfish or inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships should be about mutual support and compromise. If one partner has a deal-breaker (like wanting biological kids) that the other can't fulfill, then it's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, the way it's handled matters. If the author is considering leaving without fully understanding his feelings or not being open to other solutions, that could be problematic. Also, leaving someone right after they've experienced a significant emotional blow might be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If he's being honest about his inability to adopt and decides to leave, some might see it as a personal choice rather than being an asshole. However, others might argue that he's not taking responsibility and is being selfish by prioritizing his own desires over the relationship. The girlfriend is already in a vulnerable position, and leaving her after this news could be seen as a betrayal.\n\nIn the WIBTA context, the community often looks for whether the person acted with empathy and consideration. The author did express support and love, but the decision to leave is based on his personal preferences. The line between personal needs and being selfish is thin. If he can't compromise, it's his choice, but the timing and approach might make him the asshole.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to end the relationship over an issue that's not his girlfriend's fault and not giving her a realistic chance to process or find other solutions. However, others might argue it's his choice. But considering the emotional context, he's using her infertility as a reason to leave, which is unfair.\n"
