I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're both in a relationship for five years, planning to get married, and wanted kids. They found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He feels selfish but can't change his feelings about wanting a biological child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: Communication, mutual support, and the nature of their relationship goals. The author says they had been trying for a baby for a year, so it's possible that having children together was a significant part of their plans. Now that they can't have biological kids, he's struggling with alternatives. He mentions supporting her emotionally, but his decision hinges on not wanting adoption or surrogacy. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize his desire for biological children? Well, relationships require compromise. If having biological children was a non-negotiable for him, maybe he should have considered that before getting into the relationship or before deciding to get married. But it's also valid that people's values and desires can change over time, and sometimes unexpected issues arise. \n\nHowever, the question is whether breaking up after this is the wrong move. He's in a state of emotional turmoil and hasn't made a decision yet. He's trying to weigh his feelings against her needs. The problem here is that he's considering leaving her during her time of vulnerability. She's just been told she's infertile, which is a major life event. He's acknowledging that she needs him, yet he's thinking about breaking up because of his own desires. \n\nBut is he being selfish? If they were both aware of the possibility of infertility and chose to engage in a long-term relationship, then this could have been a shared risk. However, it's possible that he didn't fully consider the implications of infertility before. Now, he's faced with a choice that he wasn't expecting. \n\nAnother angle: The author is in denial about the reality of their situation. Since they can't have biological kids, he's not open to alternatives, which might indicate that he's not willing to adjust his expectations. In that case, maybe the relationship's foundation is built on a desire he can't compromise on, making it unsustainable. However, breaking up right after the diagnosis might be seen as cruel, especially if she's relying on his emotional support. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he loves her deeply, which complicates things. If he really loves her, is breaking up the only option? Maybe they need more time to process and explore other solutions together, even if adoption isn't his first choice. But if he's certain that he can't adopt or use a surrogate, then maybe the relationship's end is inevitable. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often expect both partners to be flexible in the face of challenges. If he's unwilling to budge, he might be seen as the one in the wrong. However, personal values and desires are also important. The line between being selfish and staying true to oneself can be blurry. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for considering a breakup immediately after the diagnosis, especially when his partner is likely in a vulnerable state. But if his values are non-negotiable and they've made it clear that having biological children is essential, then it's a tough situation. However, the timing and the context of the breakup decision during her time of need might make him the asshole.\n"
