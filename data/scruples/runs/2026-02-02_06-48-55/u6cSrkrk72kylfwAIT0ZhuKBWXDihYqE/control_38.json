I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is considering breaking up with their girlfriend after learning she's infertile. They want biological children, and they don't consider adoption or surrogacy as viable options. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were planning to get married. They had been trying for a baby for a year, leading them to seek medical advice. The discovery of infertility is a significant and emotional event. The girlfriend is supportive and has suggested alternatives, but the author isn't open to those options and sees breaking up as a possibility.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's stance on adoption and surrogacy. The girlfriend is infertile, so the only ways to have biological children would be surrogacy or adoption. The author is against both, which leaves the option of not having children biologically. Since the author wants biological kids and their partner can't provide them, they're facing a conflict in their desires.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to prioritize biological children? It's a personal value, but relationships are about compromise. The girlfriend is offering solutions (adoption, surrogacy) that the author rejects without much discussion. The author's decision to consider breaking up might be seen as prioritizing their own wishes over the relationship, especially when the girlfriend is emotionally affected. However, relationships also require mutual goals. If having biological children is non-negotiable for the author, and the situation makes that impossible, it's a legitimate reason to reevaluate the relationship. But the way it's handled matters. The author hasn't decided yet, is considering options, and is being honest. They also acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings. The question is whether this makes them the asshole.\n\nFactors to consider: The author isn't making the decision yet, which shows they're trying to be thoughtful. The girlfriend is already dealing with the emotional impact of infertility, and the author is trying to support her. However, the author is also honest about their own limitations. In relationships, it's important that both partners can adjust their expectations. If the author can't adjust and it's a deal-breaker, it's not necessarily wrong. But if the author is using this as a way to avoid responsibility or not considering their partner's feelings enough, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: The author is 24, and their girlfriend is 26. They might have more time to consider alternatives, but the urgency for biological children could be a factor. The girlfriend's infertility is a medical fact, so the author's desire for a biological child might be conflicting with reality. If adoption or surrogacy aren't viable for the author, then perhaps the relationship can't fulfill that need, but it's not necessarily the author's fault if they value that deeply.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't maliciously breaking up but is dealing with a situation where their personal desires conflict with the circumstances. Since they're considering all options and supporting their partner, it's a complex situation. However, placing the value on biological children so highly that it leads to considering a breakup could be seen as selfish. But it's also a personal choice based on their values. The answer might hinge on cultural or personal beliefs about parenthood. But given the scenario, the author isn't in the wrong outright; they're dealing with a tough decision honestly. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's a cultural or ethical angle where expecting a partner to carry a child is unreasonable. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if their choice is ethical. Given the context, the author is not the asshole, so answer B.\n"
