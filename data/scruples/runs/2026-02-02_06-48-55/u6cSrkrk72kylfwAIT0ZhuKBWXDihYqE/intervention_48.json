I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering her infertility. The author is 24, in a 5-year relationship, and they had been trying to have a baby for a year. They found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. His girlfriend suggested those options, but he doesn't want them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author loves his girlfriend and supports her, but his desire for biological children is a dealbreaker. He's torn because he doesn't want to hurt her but feels he can't compromise. The key point here is whether his decision is justified. \n\nIn relationships, having children is a significant factor for many people. If someone values biological children highly and the situation makes it impossible, it can be a legitimate reason to end the relationship. However, it's important to consider the emotional impact on his girlfriend, who is already struggling with the diagnosis. \n\nThe author might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate because he's prioritizing his own desire over her need for support during a tough time. On the other hand, if having a biological child is non-negotiable for him, he's being honest about his limitations. The ethical dilemma here is whether it's fair to end the relationship because of a medical condition that wasn't chosen by either party.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. He hasn't decided yet and is seeking advice, which shows he's trying to be thoughtful. However, the act of breaking up over infertility might be viewed as the wrong choice because it's a medical issue that doesn't define her worth as a partner. Society often stigmatizes people for having such preferences, but personal values are also important. \n\nBut there's a balance between personal values and empathy. If he's breaking up solely for biological reasons, without considering alternatives or his partner's feelings, it could be seen as wrong. However, if he's clear about his stance and handles it with care, it's a personal decision. The question is whether the decision is ethically wrong.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a tough spot. His feelings are valid if having a biological child is a core value. However, the way he approaches the breakup, especially right after the diagnosis, might be considered harsh. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes personal values or the partner's emotional needs in this scenario.\n"
