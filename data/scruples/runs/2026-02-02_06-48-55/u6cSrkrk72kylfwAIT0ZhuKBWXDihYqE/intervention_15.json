I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over five years, planning to get engaged. They tried for a baby for a year and she's infertile. The author admits he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and wants his own kids with his partner. He's considering breaking up because they can't have biological kids. The main issue is whether his reasoning is valid or if he's being selfish.\n\nThe author mentions he loves her and supports her, but his desire for biological children is driving his potential decision. He's conflicted but feels he can't adopt. The key here is whether having a biological child is a deal-breaker in a long-term relationship, especially when alternatives exist. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that wanting a biological child is a personal choice, but ending a relationship over it could be seen as selfish, especially if the partner is trying to find solutions. The girlfriend is also devastated, and the author is considering breaking up while she's vulnerable. That could be seen as unkind. \n\nHowever, others might say that having children is a significant life decision, and if the author truly can't compromise and the couple can't find a middle ground, it's realistic to consider the future. But the way he's approaching it\u2014breaking up during her emotional low\u2014might be the issue. \n\nThe author's hesitation to adopt or use a surrogate without fully exploring those options could be a flaw. He mentions not knowing how to feel about adoption, but maybe not discussing it thoroughly with his partner. The fact that she suggested those options and he dismissed them without exploring might contribute to the problem. \n\nAlso, the timing of considering a breakup right after such news could be seen as insensitive. Ending the relationship when she's already dealing with a major life change might add to her emotional burden. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while biological children are important to some, the modern approach often includes adoption or surrogacy as valid paths. The author's unwillingness to consider these might make his stance seem narrow. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Is the author wrong? If he's breaking up because of a non-negotiable issue (children) that he didn't address earlier, maybe during engagement discussions, then it's a valid decision. But if he's using the infertility as an excuse to break up when he's not truly committed to alternatives, it's selfish. Since he's in the process of considering and hasn't decided yet, but the thought process centers around his own desires without fully engaging with her solutions, the argument leans towards him being in the wrong.\n"
