I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they're considering breaking up with their girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. They want biological kids and are not open to adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for five years, planning to get engaged. The guy wants a biological child, and when that's not possible, he's thinking of breaking up. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nWell, wanting to have a biological child is a personal choice. But using infertility as a reason to break up might be seen as selfish or not considering his partner's feelings. The girlfriend is already going through a tough time, and he's considering leaving her. However, he does mention supporting her and that they're dealing with the situation. Also, he hasn't decided yet but is exploring options.\n\nBut the core issue is whether it's wrong to end the relationship over this. Some might argue that not being open to alternatives is selfish. Others might say that wanting a biological child is a valid reason. However, breaking up immediately after the diagnosis, especially when the girlfriend is likely more emotionally affected, could be seen as inconsiderate. He mentions she needs him, but he's thinking about leaving. That seems harsh.\n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't decided yet but is considering it might mean he's not fully processing his emotions. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the majority of opinions would say that he's being selfish and not supporting his partner, then he's in the wrong. But if some people understand his perspective, maybe not entirely. But given the immediate thought of breaking up right after the diagnosis, even though he claims to love her, it's more likely he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
