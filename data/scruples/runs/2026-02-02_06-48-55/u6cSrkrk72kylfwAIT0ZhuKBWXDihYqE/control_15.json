I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile, despite loving her and her suggesting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The couple had been trying for a baby for a year and decided to get checked. The girlfriend is infertile, but the guy doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological children, so he's thinking of breaking up. He's torn because he loves her but can't get past this issue.\n\nNow, ethical perspectives vary. From a relationship standpoint, using infertility as a reason to break up can be seen as selfish. The girlfriend is already under stress from the diagnosis, and she's offered solutions. The guy's refusal to consider alternatives might make it hard for her, especially since she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nBut then, personal values matter. People have different priorities. If having biological children is a non-negotiable for him, maybe he's being honest about his limitations. However, the key here is whether it's fair to end the relationship over something beyond her control. Infertility isn't her fault, so holding it against her could be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, timing is important. He hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking advice. His intention to be there for her shows he's not being cruel on purpose. But the fact that he's contemplating breaking up because of this might indicate a lack of flexibility. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he goes through with the breakup, many would argue it's selfish and hurtful. But if he's being honest about his needs and the relationship isn't sustainable for both parties, some might say it's necessary. However, the fact that he's the one with the issue (wanting biological kids) and she's offered alternatives, it's more on him to adjust. \n\nIn terms of societal views, there's often a stigma around adoption, but that's changing. His unwillingness to consider it might be his personal choice, but it's also a cop-out in a situation where the problem isn't his. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's prioritizing his biological needs over her feelings and the existing relationship, especially since she's already dealt with the infertility blow. But there's also a case for personal choice (B), but I think the majority would side with A here.\n"
