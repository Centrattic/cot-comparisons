I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person writing the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The answer requires choosing between A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for over five years, and they've been trying to have a baby for a year. They both got tested, and it turned out she's infertile. The author is 24, she's 26. He's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy\u2014he wants biological kids with her. He loves her but feels he can't adopt. He's struggling with whether breaking up is selfish or not.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's reasons for considering a breakup. He loves her and acknowledges she's his love. He's also aware that this is a big blow for her. But his main issue is not being able to accept adoption or surrogacy. He feels it's important to have a biological child with her. Is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nNext, I should consider societal norms and ethical viewpoints. Infertility is a sensitive topic. Some people might view the author as selfish for prioritizing biological children over the relationship, especially when alternatives like adoption or surrogacy exist. Others might argue that wanting biological children is natural and that the author's feelings are valid, making it a personal choice rather than wrong.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She's suggested adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's open to solutions. The author's rejection of these options without further discussion might be seen as dismissive of her efforts to find a way forward. However, he did acknowledge her suggestions and supported her emotionally, so he's trying to be there for her.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. At 24, the author might not have fully processed all implications, and his current emotional state could influence his decision. He mentions not thinking straight, which suggests he's under a lot of stress. This could mean he's not making a fully considered decision, which might affect the judgment of whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author hasn't made a decision yet and is seeking external opinions. The question is whether his feelings are justified. If he's not open to any alternatives, then breaking up might be his way of being honest about his needs. However, it's also possible that with more time and discussion, they could find a compromise or understand each other's positions better.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to evaluate that. The author's reasoning is based on personal desire for biological children, which is a personal choice. However, using infertility as a reason to break up, especially when alternatives are on the table, might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if the author truly cannot accept any alternative and it's a non-negotiable deal-breaker, it might not be his fault.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a nuanced situation. The author is in a difficult emotional state. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his decision to prioritize his desire for biological children over the relationship is considered selfish or a legitimate personal choice. Given that he's trying to be supportive and hasn't made a final decision, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the potential selfishness in his reasoning, but there's a counterargument for B as well. However, the majority of people might argue that he's in the wrong because he's choosing his biological preference over the relationship despite alternatives.\n"
