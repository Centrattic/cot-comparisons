I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, both are in their early 20s, and they were planning to get married. They wanted kids, tried for a year, and she's infertile. The author is struggling with the idea of adoption or surrogacy and is considering breaking up because he wants biological kids. The girlfriend suggested alternatives, but he doesn't want to pursue them. He loves her but feels this is a dealbreaker.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's the asshole (in the WIBTA context). The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider factors like the emotional impact, communication, and whether his reaction is justified. In many relationships, infertility can be a significant issue. The girlfriend is already offering alternatives, which shows she's willing to work through it. The author says he can't consider adoption or surrogacy, which are valid options, but his decision to break up because of this might be seen as prioritizing his biological desire over the relationship. \n\nSociety often values biological parenthood, but in relationships, compromise is key. The author is essentially saying that having a child with her isn't possible, but he's not open to other ways of building a family. That could be seen as selfish, especially since the girlfriend is offering solutions. Also, breaking up under these circumstances might leave her in a more vulnerable emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible that having a child is a non-negotiable for him, and he's being honest about his feelings. But the key point is that he's considering leaving her specifically because she can't give him biological children, which might not be fair to her since it's not her choice. \n\nIn most cases like this, people might argue that he's being the asshole because he's not willing to compromise and is making the decision based on his own desires without considering her feelings and the future of the relationship. The girlfriend already suggested alternatives, so his not being open to them could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
