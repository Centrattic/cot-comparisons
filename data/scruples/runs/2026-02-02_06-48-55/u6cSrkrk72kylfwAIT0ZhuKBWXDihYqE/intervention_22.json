I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for five years, trying to have a baby for a year, and now they found out she's infertile. He mentions he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy and is considering breaking up because he wants his own biological kids. He loves her but is struggling with this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether breaking up over infertility is wrong. From one perspective, he's being honest about his desires. He's not forcing her to adopt if she's not into it. But on the other hand, ending a long-term relationship because of infertility could be seen as selfish, especially since she's already offered alternatives and he's dismissing them. \n\nInfertility is a tough situation for both partners. The decision to have kids is a big part of a relationship, and values about that can vary. If he's clear that biological children are non-negotiable, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But he's making her go through a breakup after she's already emotionally hurt. Also, he's not considering other options fully, like surrogacy, which she suggested. \n\nIs it fair to end the relationship because of something not either of their faults? He's the one who had the strong reaction, so it's his choice. But he's also not taking her feelings into account, especially since she's already dealing with the infertility news. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's being selfish. He's prioritizing his own desire for biological children over the relationship, which he claims he loves. That could make him the asshole. But maybe some would argue that it's his right to be honest about his wants. \n\nThe community might split here. However, since he's the one initiating the breakup over something that's not his fault (infertility is an external factor), but his choice to end things because of his personal preferences might be seen as wrong. Especially if he's not open to any alternatives she's suggested. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong. He's causing emotional harm to her, and it's a bit selfish to break up over this when they've both been through so much already.\n"
