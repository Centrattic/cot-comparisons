I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he and his girlfriend found out she's infertile. They were trying to have a baby for a year and decided to check. The guy is considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her a lot but feels he can't be with her if they can't have their own biological kids. The question is whether he's the asshole if he breaks up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The woman is devastated, and he's considering leaving her. On one hand, he's honest about his feelings and priorities. He's not hiding his desire to have biological children. On the other hand, breaking up after such news could be seen as heartless, especially if she's already suggested alternatives like adoption. \n\nI should think about whether his reasons are valid. Wanting biological children is a personal choice, but is it selfish? Some people might say that choosing a partner based on their ability to have children is not fair, especially if it's not their fault. However, others might argue that it's about personal desires and being honest about them.\n\nAlso, the woman might have different feelings. If she's willing to consider adoption or surrogacy, maybe the man is dismissing her efforts to find solutions. The fact that he left it at that when she suggested adoption shows he didn't engage further. It's possible he didn't explore these options more thoroughly, which could make his decision seem abrupt.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. They were planning to get engaged, so this decision could impact her emotionally. The man is trying to be supportive but also struggling with his own needs. The key is whether his decision is based on genuine incompatibility or if he's using infertility as an excuse for other issues.\n\nIn terms of societal views, people have different opinions on this. Some might support his honesty, others might see it as using a medical condition as a reason to leave. The woman's perspective is important here, but we only have the man's side. \n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor. For example, if they had discussed having kids before, maybe this wasn't a surprise. Since the post says they were trying for a year, maybe they had expectations of biological children. However, the infertile party isn't at fault here, so ending the relationship could be seen as blaming her.\n\nIn summary, the man's reasons are personal and he's being honest, but acting on them by breaking up might be seen as inconsiderate. The woman's emotional state and the fact that she proposed alternatives suggest that his decision might be selfish. Therefore, he could be in the wrong.\n"
