I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they found out their girlfriend is infertile, and the author is considering breaking up because they don't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They love her but can't get past the fact that they want their own biological kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Infertility is a tough issue for many couples. The author mentions that they had been trying for a year before deciding to get tested. The girlfriend is already suggesting alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which shows she's trying to find solutions. The author, however, is not open to those options. The key here is whether breaking up over this is reasonable or if the author is being selfish.\n\nThe author says they want their own kids with their own woman, implying they want a biological child. But since the girlfriend can't carry a child, they're considering ending the relationship. That seems pretty harsh. The girlfriend is the love of his life, but he's choosing not to be with her because of something outside their control. \n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. The girlfriend is devastated, and the author acknowledges that breaking up would be hard for her. The author is torn because they don't want to leave her after this news, but they can't shake the feeling. It sounds like they're struggling with their own values versus their partner's needs.\n\nIs wanting a biological child a valid reason for breaking up? Maybe in some cases, but the author is in a situation where their partner is offering alternatives. By rejecting those, they're prioritizing their own biological desires over their partner's feelings and the relationship they've built. That could be seen as selfish because it's not about being unable to adapt but about not wanting to consider other options.\n\nThe author also mentions they haven't decided yet. It's possible they're under emotional stress and might not be thinking clearly. But even so, the decision to break up based on infertility could be seen as not being fair to the girlfriend, who is already dealing with a significant emotional blow. The author is adding to her pain by considering leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if having biological children is a non-negotiable for the author, then maybe they are being honest about their needs. However, in a committed relationship, compromise is usually expected. The author isn't showing a willingness to compromise here. They're closing the door on possible solutions that their partner is open to.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a difficult situation, but their desire to have biological children without considering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, despite the partner's willingness to explore them, seems to put them in the wrong. It's about not respecting the partner's efforts to adapt and not considering their emotional state during this time.\n"
