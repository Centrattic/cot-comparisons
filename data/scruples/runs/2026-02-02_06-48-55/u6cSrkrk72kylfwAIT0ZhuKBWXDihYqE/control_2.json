I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend found out she's infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He wants biological kids with her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author hasn't decided yet but is considering breaking up because he can't get over the fact that they can't have a biological child. He mentions that he loves her and she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e. But he also states he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy, which are alternatives she suggested.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here. \n\nBiological child desire is a personal choice. Some people place a high value on having their own children, while others are open to adoption or surrogacy. The key point here is communication. The author says he told her that her suggestions (adoption/surrogacy) were good ideas but didn't express his own feelings about it. That could be a problem because he's not being honest. If he's considering breaking up, he should have had an open conversation with her about his feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel blindsided if he suddenly breaks up without discussing his true feelings. Infertility can be a significant stressor, and the author's decision to consider breaking up might be seen as selfish, especially since he acknowledges she's going through a bigger emotional blow. However, he does express that he's been supportive and they've been dealing with it. \n\nBut the fact that he's contemplating breaking up based on his inability to accept alternatives might be seen as putting his own desires above her emotional state. Even though it's his personal choice, the timing and lack of communication could make it his fault. Also, the scenario mentions that he hasn't decided yet, so maybe he's not fully aware of the implications. \n\nIn many cases, people do have different values and sometimes that leads to breaking up, but it's important how that decision is handled. If he's not honest with her and just walks away, that's unkind. However, if he's genuinely unable to accept alternatives and they can't find a compromise, then maybe it's a mutual issue. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the author hasn't communicated his true feelings about not wanting adoption/surrogacy. He should have discussed this with her before making a decision. By not doing so, he might be making a hasty and selfish choice. So, he could be in the wrong because he's considering breaking up without fully discussing his stance, which might leave his girlfriend feeling unsupported. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
