I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend because she's infertile. The situation is complex because it involves personal values and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together for over five years and were planning to marry. They wanted to have a baby, so they checked their fertility. The girlfriend is infertile, and he's considering breaking up because he doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels that having a biological child is important. The question is whether his potential decision is wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, ending the relationship over infertility raises some ethical questions. The girlfriend might feel that her worth is tied to her ability to have children, which is a sensitive issue. But the author is also clear that he's not selfish; he's stating his desires. \n\nOn one hand, relationships require compromise. If the author is not willing to consider alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, that could be seen as not being flexible. On the other hand, people have the right to their own values and boundaries. The article mentions that the author supports her emotionally, which is good, but the decision to break up might be seen as using her during a vulnerable time.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not making a decision yet but considering breaking up. It's possible he's reacting out of shock or not fully processing the situation. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong if he does break up. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that wanting biological children is valid, but others might see breaking up as unfair given the girlfriend's position. The key points are mutual understanding and whether the decision is made out of selfishness or genuine incompatibility. The author acknowledges it might seem selfish but believes it's necessary for his happiness. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision to break up is a personal choice, it could be seen as wrong because it's based on his inability to compromise on a significant issue that wasn't known at the start of the relationship. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, and the author might be prioritizing his own desires over the relationship he's already committed to. So, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
