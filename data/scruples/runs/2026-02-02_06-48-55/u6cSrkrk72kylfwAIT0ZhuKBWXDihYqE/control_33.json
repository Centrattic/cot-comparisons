I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author hasn't made a decision yet, but he's thinking about it because he wants biological kids with her and doesn't consider adoption or surrogacy as viable options. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together over five years, and they were planning to get married. The girlfriend suggested adoption or a surrogate, but the author isn't open to that. He feels it's important for the child to be biologically theirs.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, in relationships, people have different values and expectations. The author's reasoning is that he wants biological children, and since that's not possible, he's considering breaking up. But is that selfish? On one hand, he's being honest about his desires, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, his partner might see this as using her infertility as a reason to end the relationship, especially when she's already suggested alternatives.\n\nI should think about societal norms. Some might say that wanting biological children is a personal preference, and it's valid if both partners agree. However, if one partner is willing to adapt (like considering adoption) and the other isn't, it's a conflict. The author is dismissing her solutions, which could be seen as not compromising. Also, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant\u2014she might feel rejected or blamed for the infertility.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. He mentions he hasn't decided yet, but the question is whether breaking up over this is wrong. Relationships require mutual goals. If they can't find a middle ground, the breakup might be inevitable, but using infertility as the reason could be hurtful. The author says he loves her, but his decision is based on a fundamental desire for biological kids, which she can't fulfill. \n\nIn some cases, people prioritize biological children highly, but it's important to consider the other person's feelings. The author might be right to consider his feelings, but there's a chance he's not fully processing the situation yet. He's also aware it sounds selfish, which is a red flag. \n\nOverall, while the author is being honest about his feelings, using infertility as the sole reason for breaking up could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since his partner is offering alternatives. It's a tough situation, but he might not be entirely in the wrong because he's standing by his values, but there's a strong argument that he's not considering her feelings enough. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own desires without adequately addressing her solutions and the emotional toll on her.\n"
