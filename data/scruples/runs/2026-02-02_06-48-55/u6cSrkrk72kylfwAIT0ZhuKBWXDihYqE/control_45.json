I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants biological kids with her, but she's infertile, and he's not into adoption or surrogacy. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is his decision to potentially end the relationship due to infertility. Is this his fault? Well, relationships are complex, and people have different priorities. His girlfriend is going through a tough time, and he's being supportive, which is a positive. However, his desire to have biological children and not considering alternatives like adoption or surrogacy could be seen as selfish or not considering her feelings.\n\nInfertility can be a significant factor in relationships, and how each partner responds matters. The author is honest about his feelings but might be overlooking his girlfriend's perspective. She's suggested adoption or surrogacy, which he dismissed. If he values having his own genetic children, maybe the problem isn't solely her infertility but his own inability to compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not making a decision yet and is still processing. He's trying to balance his desires with his commitment to her. However, the fact that he's contemplating leaving her after such a big life event could be hurtful. People have different boundaries, and if having a biological child is non-negotiable for him, then maybe the relationship isn't aligned. But ending it so quickly might not be fair, especially if she's already dealing with the emotional impact.\n\nSociety often places a lot of pressure on having biological children, which can influence such decisions. The author's stance might be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his own desires over the relationship he's already committed to. However, it's also his right to have certain expectations in a relationship. The question is whether breaking up over this is the right move. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he needs to communicate openly with his girlfriend about his feelings and listen to hers. If he breaks up without considering her feelings or alternatives, he might be in the wrong. But if they've truly discussed all options and he still can't compromise, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The key is whether he's being considerate and supportive throughout the process. Since he's still considering, it's a nuanced situation. However, the initial inclination is that he's placing his needs above the relationship's future without fully exploring compromises, which could make him the asshole.\n"
