I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The situation is that they've been together five years, wanted kids, and now she can't have them. He's thinking about breaking up because he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author is struggling with his desire to have biological children versus his partner's inability to do so. On one hand, he loves her and has been supportive. On the other, his core wish for biological kids can't be fulfilled through her. \n\nInfertility is a tough issue. It's not her fault, but it's affecting their future plans. The author is honest about his feelings and isn't hiding his stance. He's considering the breakup as a way to avoid not being able to meet his own needs. But is that fair to her? She's already been through the emotional trauma of finding out she's infertile, and now he's contemplating leaving her.\n\nIs the author being selfish? He admits he thinks it's selfish, but it's how he feels. The question is whether his feelings justify the breakup. Relationships often require compromise. If she's open to adoption or surrogacy and he's not, maybe they can't find a middle ground. But if he's unwilling to consider alternatives, is that his problem?\n\nSociety sometimes places a lot of emphasis on biological children, which can put pressure on individuals. However, in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page. If he can't accept her limitations, then maybe the relationship isn't sustainable for him. But is it fair to break up because of something beyond her control? \n\nThe key here is whether his decision is based on her infertility rather than her actions or choices. In many cases, using infertility as a reason to end a relationship is seen as problematic because it's not her fault. However, if he's clear that this is his dealbreaker and he's not hiding it, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But still, it's a sensitive issue. \n\nThe author is considering the breakup out of his own inability to adapt, which could be seen as not being fully committed to the relationship. The girlfriend is trying to find solutions, but he's not willing to explore them. That might make him the one who isn't trying to work through the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while his feelings are valid, acting on them by breaking up because of her infertility might be considered wrong. It's a tough spot, but the fact that he's contemplating leaving due to something not her fault could place him in the wrong. So, the answer might be A.\n"
