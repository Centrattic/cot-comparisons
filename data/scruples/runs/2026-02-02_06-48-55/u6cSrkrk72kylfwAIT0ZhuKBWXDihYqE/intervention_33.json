I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is an asshole (WIBTA) for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. The author is a guy, 24, in a five-year relationship. They had been trying for a baby for a year and now are told she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he can't accept adoption or surrogacy and wants biological kids. He loves her but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the relationship. They've been together for over five years, which is a significant time. The woman is 26, so both are young. The fact that they had been trying for a baby for a year suggests that having children is a priority for both. Now, the girlfriend is suggesting alternatives like adoption or a surrogate, but the author is resistant to those options. He's struggling with his own feelings about wanting a biological child and possibly feeling that he can't move forward without that. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's decision to break up is justified. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate that. Let's consider the factors. The author is in a state of emotional turmoil, which is understandable given the news. He's trying to process his feelings, but he's also considering ending the relationship. The question is whether wanting to break up over infertility is selfish or if it's a valid personal choice.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his desires. He wants biological children and doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. If he can't reconcile that with the situation, maybe it's a matter of personal values. However, breaking up immediately after the diagnosis might be seen as insensitive, especially since the girlfriend might be more affected by the news. She might feel that the relationship is being ended due to her infertility rather than mutual understanding. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he loves her and doesn't want to hurt her, which complicates things. There's a sense of conflict between his love for her and his personal needs. The question is whether his needs are valid enough to justify breaking up. But is it fair to end a long-term relationship over this without exploring other possibilities? The girlfriend is open to adoption or surrogacy, but the author isn't considering those options, which might be a point against him. \n\nAnother angle is the timing. The author hasn't decided yet, just contemplating options. But the question is about if he's in the wrong if he does break up. Society often has different expectations about parenthood, but it's important to recognize that everyone's values differ. However, ending a relationship solely because of infertility can be seen as placing blame on the partner, which is unfair. \n\nI should also think about the emotional impact on the girlfriend. She might feel rejected or blamed for something beyond her control. Infertility can be a shared issue, but in this case, the author is focusing on her infertility. That could be hurtful. The author's reasoning is that he wants a biological child with his partner, but if that's not possible, he can't move forward. But is that a valid reason? It might be considered selfish, as it's ending the relationship over a personal desire that he could have discussed and possibly negotiated. \n\nOn the other hand, personal values and desires are valid. The author is being truthful about his feelings, but the way he's handling it could be seen as inconsiderate. Breaking up immediately might be hasty, and it's possible that with time and discussion, they could find a solution that works for both. However, the author is struggling with his own emotions and might not be thinking clearly yet. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the breakup is due to a personal choice to prioritize biological children over the relationship, that could be seen as selfish. However, if he's being honest about his needs and they're not compatible, it's a difficult situation. But given the context of a long-term relationship and the girlfriend's suggestion of alternatives, the author's decision to break up might be considered inconsiderate, hence the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
