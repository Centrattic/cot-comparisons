I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the man is considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. He wants to have his own biological children and isn't open to adoption or surrogacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple had been trying for a baby for a year, leading them to check for fertility issues. The girlfriend is infertile, and the man realizes he wants biological kids, which isn't possible without adoption or surrogacy. He's considering breaking up because he's not open to those options. \n\nThe main ethical question here is about values and expectations in a relationship. Having children is a significant part of many people's lives, and if both partners can't agree on the methods to achieve that, it can be a deal-breaker. However, the man is being honest about his feelings and isn't hiding his stance. He's also acknowledging that this might be selfish. \n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being upfront and not forcing his partner into a situation she might prefer. He's considering his own needs and values. On the other hand, breaking up right after such a devastating diagnosis could be seen as insensitive, especially since the girlfriend might be more affected emotionally. \n\nBut the man is also in a tough spot. If he doesn't feel he can be fully committed to a future without biological children, staying in the relationship might lead to resentment later. Relationships require mutual goals, and if having biological kids is non-negotiable for him, then this could be a valid reason to part ways, even if it's hard. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important too. She suggested adoption or surrogacy, showing she's trying to adapt. The man is honest he doesn't want that. There's a mismatch in their priorities. Is it his fault? Or is it a mutual incompatibility? \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about intent. He's not being cruel or manipulative; he's struggling with his own desires. But the timing and the emotional impact on his partner are factors. However, the question is whether he's wrong for considering a breakup based on his own values. \n\nI think it's a complex situation, but the man isn't necessarily in the wrong for having these feelings. Everyone has their deal-breakers. The key is that he's not pushing his views on her but is honest about his own. So, he's not the asshole if he's being genuine and not forcing her to stay. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
