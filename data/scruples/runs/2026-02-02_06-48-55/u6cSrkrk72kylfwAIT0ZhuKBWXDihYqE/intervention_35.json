I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over five years and wanted to have a baby. They tried for a year and then decided to get tested. The girlfriend is infertile, which is a significant issue for them. The author mentions that he loves her very much and she was about to be his fianc\u00e9e. However, he doesn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. He wants to have biological children with her, which isn't possible, so he's considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the key points here are his motivations. He says it's not selfish, but he admits that it might sound that way. He wants a child who is both biologically his and his partner's. But the fact that she can't conceive biologically makes that impossible. He's conflicted because he loves her but can't see past this issue. The question is whether breaking up over this is wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. On one hand, he's being honest about his desires and needs. On the other hand, breaking up after five years and during a time when she's also dealing with the emotional impact of infertility could be seen as cruel. It might be unfair to her if she's willing to explore alternatives like adoption or surrogacy, which he dismisses. \n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't decided yet but is seeking advice suggests he's struggling with this. It's important to note that his reasoning is about his own inability to accept adoption or surrogacy, which are valid choices for others but not for him. However, using her infertility as a reason to end the relationship might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her well-being, especially since she's already suggested alternatives that he didn't engage with beyond a surface level.\n\nBut is it his fault for having these feelings? People have different values and priorities. If he's clear from the start about wanting biological children, then making a decision based on that isn't inherently wrong. However, in this case, they had already been trying for a baby, so he might have assumed she could conceive. Now that they know she can't, he's realizing this is a deal-breaker. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between his right to pursue his own desires and her right to continue the relationship despite the setback. Since he's the one who can't reconcile his wants with the reality, does that make him the asshole? Or is he just being honest with himself?\n\nI think the main issue is that he's not considering her feelings or the options she's willing to take. If she's open to adoption or surrogacy, and he's not, then his decision to break up might be premature. He hasn't explored her suggestions, which could be a way to move forward together. His focus on having a biological child might be unrealistic, especially since many people choose adoption or surrogacy successfully. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own unchangeable desire for biological children over the relationship and the alternatives his girlfriend is proposing. He hasn't given those options a fair chance, which could have salvaged the relationship. Therefore, breaking up based on her infertility without considering her perspective and solutions is selfish and hurtful.\n"
