I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. \n\nObviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. \n\nShe has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. \n\nI want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong for considering breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she's infertile. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for over five years, and they were trying to have a baby for a year. They found out she's infertile. He's considering breaking up because he wants biological kids with her and doesn't want adoption or surrogacy. He loves her, but he can't get past this.\n\nNow, the key points here are about his feelings and their relationship. The author is conflicted because he loves her but can't reconcile his desire for biological children. He's thinking of breaking up not because of something she did wrong, but because of personal desires. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. Is it wrong to prioritize personal biological desires over a long-term relationship? Infertility is a medical condition, not a choice. The girlfriend didn't cause this. The author is realizing that his inability to accept adoption or surrogacy might mean the end of their relationship. \n\nSociety often places a lot of emphasis on having biological children, but that's changing. Some people value other paths to parenthood. However, if one partner is unwilling to consider alternatives, that could be a deal-breaker. \n\nBut here, the author is making a decision based on his own values. He's not necessarily being selfish, but he's choosing his desires over the relationship. However, breaking up because of infertility might be seen as insensitive, especially since the infertility isn't her fault. The girlfriend might feel blamed, even if he doesn't intend it. \n\nThe author is also in a vulnerable position, processing a big life event. He's considering breaking up when his partner might be relying on his support. That could be seen as a lack of empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require mutual goals. If he can't adjust his expectations to include adoption or surrogacy, maybe the breakup is inevitable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for it. If he's being honest about his limitations, it's not inherently wrong, but the way it's handled matters. \n\nIn some perspectives, wanting to have biological children is valid. But if one partner can't meet that need, it's a legitimate reason to end the relationship. However, the method and timing matter. Breaking up immediately after the diagnosis, before exploring alternatives, might seem hasty or thoughtless. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested adoption, and he dismissed it without engagement. That could be seen as dismissive of her efforts to find solutions. If he's not open to discussing alternatives, maybe the issue is about communication rather than the infertility itself. \n\nIn terms of whether he's an asshole, it's tricky. He's not malicious; he's struggling with his desires. But he's considering leaving his partner in a time of emotional distress, which can be hurtful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his decision is based on personal values vs. something he can compromise on. Since he can't compromise, it's not entirely his fault, but he could be considered in the wrong for not supporting her during this time and for prioritizing his own wishes without considering her emotional state. But others might see it as a valid personal choice. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because breaking up over something beyond her control, especially when she's already struggling, can be seen as unkind. But I'm a bit conflicted. If he's honest and they both realize they can't meet each other's needs, it's a mutual decision. But the way he's framing it now, it's more about his own inability to adjust, which might make it his fault.\n"
