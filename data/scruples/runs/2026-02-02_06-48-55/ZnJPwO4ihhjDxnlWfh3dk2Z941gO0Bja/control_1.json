Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police was in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author took their two-year-old to the park and saw another mom leave her toddler alone in the swing for 12 minutes. The author called the non-emergency line, and when the mom came back, the police did a wellness check. Other people were judgmental, but the author still feels it was right to be concerned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, leaving a child unattended in public could be considered neglect. The child was under two, which is a vulnerable age. The swing was high off the ground, so there's a risk of injury if the child fell. The author wasn't sure if anyone else was watching the child, so it's possible no one was supervising. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. Parents have a responsibility to supervise their children, especially in public places. If leaving a child alone poses a risk, others might step in to prevent harm. The author's action was to call the police, which is a standard procedure in such cases. It's a non-emergency line, so they followed the correct protocol.\n\nHowever, the author might have felt embarrassed due to the other parents' reactions. But that doesn't mean the action was wrong. The key here is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The child was left unattended for a significant time in a public space with potential dangers. The author's concern seems valid. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the mom left for a valid reason, like using the restroom or getting a drink. But even so, leaving a toddler alone in a swing for 12 minutes without supervision is risky. The author couldn't see where the mom went, so there's no way to know her intentions. \n\nIn terms of legal liability, if the mom had left the child and something happened, she could be culpable. The police's wellness check would assess if there's a need for intervention. The author's call was a responsible action to ensure the child's safety. \n\nThe other parents' judgment is their own opinion, but the author's intention was to prevent potential harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong for acting on concern for another child's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
