Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person wrote about calling the police on another mom who left her toddler alone at the park for 12 minutes. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The mom left her toddler in a swing. Swings can be high off the ground, and the child was under 2. The author waited 7 minutes, then called the police. The police were going to do a wellness check, and the mom came back after 12 minutes.\n\nNow, is it wrong to call the police in this case? On one hand, a child left alone for that long in a public park could be dangerous. There's the risk of the child falling, getting hurt, or being approached by strangers. The author mentions the location is near public transit, which adds to the risk. The parent's job is to supervise their child, and leaving them unattended for 12 minutes in that environment might be negligent.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mom had a legitimate reason. Maybe she was just getting a drink, using the restroom, or something quick. The author didn't know her intentions. But even a short time can be risky for a toddler. The author was within their right to be concerned and act to prevent potential harm. The police were called as a wellness check, not an immediate accusation, which seems appropriate.\n\nOther parents at the park laughed at the author, which might indicate a lack of understanding about the risks involved. The author's action was based on genuine concern for the child's safety. While it's possible the mom had a reason, the author didn't have that information. The safety of a child is a priority, and the law in many places requires someone to report suspected neglect or danger to a child.\n\nSo, I think the author acted appropriately. The key here is the child's safety versus the mom's possible intentions. Since the author couldn't know the mom's reasons and the situation posed a risk, calling the police was the right decision. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
