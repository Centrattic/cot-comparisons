Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author took their two-year-old to the park. Another mom left her toddler alone in the swing for about 12 minutes. The author called the police because they were worried about the child's safety. The police did a wellness check. Other people at the park seemed to mock the author for calling the cops. The author feels embarrassed but still believes it was the right thing to do because leaving a toddler unattended in a public area is dangerous.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, leaving a child unattended in public can be considered neglect or endangerment. The laws vary, but generally, children under a certain age must be supervised. The author's actions were to report a potential danger, which is a civic duty. However, maybe the police's response was a wellness check, which suggests they didn't see a crime, but the author's concern was valid.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was concerned for another child's safety, which is commendable. But did they overstep by calling the police? Some might argue that it's a parent's responsibility to supervise their child, and others should respect that unless there's clear harm. However, the child was left alone for a significant time in a public area, which could pose risks like abduction, injury, or contact with strangers.\n\nThe other parents' reactions suggest that some people think the author was too judgmental. But the author's intention was safety, not judgment. It's a balance between trusting other parents and ensuring a child's well-being.\n\nI need to check if the police's response indicates that the situation wasn't serious. If they did a wellness check, maybe they didn't find any issues. But the author's concern was based on the child being left alone for 12 minutes in a high swing, which could be risky. The transit area nearby adds to the danger.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, society often encourages reporting potential child endangerment. The author acted on their concern, which is a protective measure. However, the embarrassment from others' reactions shows social stigma against intervening, even when it's for a good reason.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014legal duty to report, the potential risk to the child, and the intention to protect\u2014I think the author is not in the wrong. They acted out of concern for a child's safety, which is a valid and responsible action. The other mom might be at fault for leaving her child unattended, but the author's call to the police was appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
