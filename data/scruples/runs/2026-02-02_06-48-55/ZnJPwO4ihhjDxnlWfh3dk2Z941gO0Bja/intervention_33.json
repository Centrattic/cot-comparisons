Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mom who left her toddler unattended at the park for 12 minutes. The author took her son to the park, saw another mom leave her kid in a swing, and after waiting, called the police. The other mom came back, the police did a wellness check, and some people in the park were making fun of the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, leaving a child unattended in a public place could be considered neglect, depending on the duration and circumstances. If the child is under 2 and left alone for 12 minutes without supervision, that might be a breach of child protection laws. The author called the non-emergency police line, which seems like a responsible action because if she believed the child was in danger, reporting it is the right thing to do.\n\nBut maybe there's a gray area. The other mom left for 12 minutes. Was that long enough to be considered neglectful? It's a short time, but in a public park, even a few minutes could be risky. The author mentions the park is near public transit, so there could be strangers around. So, the concern for the child's safety is valid.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that the author overreacted. The mom was gone for 12 minutes, which could be a short time in some contexts. Maybe the mom just stepped away to use the restroom or get something from the car. The author didn't see any other adults watching the child, which adds to the concern, but maybe she assumed the worst without knowing the full story.\n\nAnother angle: the author called the police out of concern for the child's safety. That's a proactive step to ensure the child isn't in danger. On the other hand, if the mom was just momentarily distracted, the police call could be seen as unnecessary. But given the potential risk, it's hard to say the author was wrong for trying to protect a child.\n\nThe reactions of other parents in the park are interesting. One laughed at the author, suggesting some people don't see the severity. But the author's perspective is that she was genuinely worried. It's a tough balance between being overzealous and under-reacting. In situations where a child's safety is in question, erring on the side of caution is usually advised.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted on her concern for a child's safety. While the time might not have been extremely long, the environment and the age of the child could justify her actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling the police in this scenario.\n"
