Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on a mom who left her toddler alone at the park. The author explains that they noticed the mom leaving her toddler in the swing multiple times, eventually for 12 minutes. They called the non-emergency line, and the police did a wellness check. Other parents reacted with judgment, and the author feels embarrassed.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from a moral and legal standpoint. The key points are: the toddler is under 2 years old, left alone in a swing for 12 minutes in a public park. The author was concerned about safety, like strangers nearby and public transit nearby. They called the police, which led to a wellness check.\n\nLegally, in many places, leaving a child unattended in a way that poses a risk could be considered child neglect. The author's action of calling the police was a report of potential neglect. Even if the police only did a wellness check, the intent was to ensure the child's safety. The author's concern seems valid because toddlers can't take care of themselves and are vulnerable.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author acted out of concern for a child's safety. Even if the other mom made a mistake, the author's intervention might have prevented a potential accident or harm. On the flip side, some might argue that the other parent might have had a brief moment (like using the restroom, getting a drink) and the author overreacted. However, the duration of 12 minutes is significant for a very young child in a public area.\n\nThe other parents' reactions\u2014mocking the author\u2014suggest a societal debate on how to handle such situations. The author's embarrassment might stem from social judgment rather than the action itself. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was likely justified. They took a responsible step to check on a child's welfare, which is a common concern among parents. The other mom's actions could be neglectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for trying to ensure the child's safety. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
