Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on a mom who left her toddler alone for 12 minutes at a park. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author saw another mom leave her toddler in a swing multiple times, and after 7 minutes of being alone, the author called the police. The mom was gone for 12 minutes total. The police came and did a wellness check. Others at the park laughed at the author, but the author felt it was dangerous.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, leaving a child unsupervised can be considered neglect. For example, some states have \"safe haven\" laws or specific child abandonment statutes. If a child is left in a risky situation, reporting it is a responsible action. The author was concerned about the toddler's safety, especially near public areas where strangers might be around.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother was just stepping away briefly and the 12 minutes were an accident. But the author couldn't see the mother for that long, and the toddler was in a high swing. The author did call the non-emergency line, which shows they tried to handle it without overreacting. \n\nAlso, the police decided to do a wellness check, implying they took the concern seriously. The other parents' reactions don't define right or wrong; just because others laughed doesn't mean the author was wrong. The author's primary concern was the child's safety, which is valid. \n\nSo, legally, reporting a possible child endangerment case is within one's rights. Ethically, prioritizing a child's safety over potential embarrassment or judgment from others is responsible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
