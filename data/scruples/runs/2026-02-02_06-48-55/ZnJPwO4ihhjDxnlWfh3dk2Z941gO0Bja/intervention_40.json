Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on another mom for leaving her toddler alone is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author saw a mom leave her toddler in the swing for about 12 minutes. The author called the police non-emergency line, which then did a wellness check. Other people at the park reacted judgmentally, and the author feels embarrassed but still believes the mom's action was dangerous.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate based on societal norms and laws. \n\nLeaving a toddler unattended in a public place could be considered neglect, depending on local laws. The author's concern is valid because young children can't take care of themselves. The police were called as a precaution, which is a common response for potential child neglect. \n\nHowever, calling the police might be seen as overstepping if the situation wasn't an emergency. The mom did return, and the police only did a wellness check. The author's embarrassment and the judgment from others suggest some people might think it's not their place to intervene unless the child was in immediate danger. \n\nOn the other hand, the author acted out of genuine concern. The child was alone for 12 minutes in a place with potential strangers nearby. The author kept an eye on the kid, which shows they didn't just report and walk away. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. Some might argue that it's better to err on the side of caution for a child's safety. Others might think it's an unnecessary call that invades the other mom's privacy. But given the potential risk, the author's action seems justified. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
