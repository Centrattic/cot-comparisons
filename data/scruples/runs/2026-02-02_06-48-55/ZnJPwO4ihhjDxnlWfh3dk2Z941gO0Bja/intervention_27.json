Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on another mom at the park was in the wrong. The situation is that the author saw a toddler left alone in a swing for about 12 minutes and decided to call the non-emergency line. Now, the author feels embarrassed because other parents laughed at them, but they still think it was right to be concerned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, leaving a child unattended in public can be considered neglect, especially if the child is very young. The author took action because they were genuinely worried about the toddler's safety. Swings can be dangerous if a child is left unsupervised, as they can swing too high, fall out, or get hurt. Plus, the park is near public transit, which adds to the risk of strangers approaching.\n\nOn the other hand, the other parents' reactions suggest that maybe there's a cultural or situational nuance. Maybe the mom was just stepping away briefly, and others see it as normal. But the key here is the duration\u201412 minutes is a long time for a toddler to be alone, especially under two years old. The police did a wellness check, which indicates they took the concern seriously enough.\n\nThe author called the non-emergency line, which is the right protocol. If they had called emergency services, that might have been different, but non-emergency is for situations that need attention without immediate danger. The author also tried to look out for the child by pushing the swing until the mom returned, which shows they weren't just reporting out of spite but genuine concern.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the police, especially if the mom was just momentarily distracted. But given the time and the risks, it's a valid safety measure. The other parents' laughter seems dismissive, but the author's intent was protective. \n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the author was justified in their actions. They acted to protect a child they perceived to be in danger, followed proper procedures, and didn't escalate unnecessarily. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
