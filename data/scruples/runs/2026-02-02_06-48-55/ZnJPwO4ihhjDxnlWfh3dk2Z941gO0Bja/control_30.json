Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called the police on another mom for leaving her toddler alone was in the wrong. So, first, I need to parse the situation carefully.\n\nThe author was at the park with their two-year-old. Another mom left her toddler in the swing, came back briefly, then left again. The author noticed the child was alone for about 12 minutes and called the non-emergency police line. The police sent a wellness check. Others at the park judged the author, with some laughing at the concern. The author feels embarrassed but still believes it was necessary for the child's safety.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the child's age (under 2), the duration the child was left alone (12 minutes), the location (park near public transit), and the author's actions.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, leaving a child unattended in a public place can be considered neglect, especially for a toddler. The police were called via the non-emergency number, which suggests the author didn't escalate it to an emergency unless necessary. The officer's response was a wellness check, which is a standard procedure to assess the situation.\n\nThe other parents' reactions are dismissive, but that doesn't necessarily negate the author's concern. The author was acting in what they believed to be the child's best interest. However, there's a question of overstepping if the situation wasn't immediately dangerous. But considering the child was left alone for 12 minutes in a public area with potential strangers, it's a valid safety concern.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, laws allow for a parent to leave a child unattended if it's safe and for a short time. However, 12 minutes might be considered too long for a very young child. The police's wellness check indicates they took the report seriously.\n\nMoral responsibility: As a parent, the author might feel compelled to protect another child. Society often encourages intervening in potentially dangerous situations, especially for vulnerable individuals like children.\n\nPotential criticism could be that the author should have tried to locate the parent first or ask someone else to help before calling the police. But in this case, the author looked around and couldn't find the mom. They also kept an eye on the child while waiting for police, which shows they were trying to ensure safety themselves.\n\nThe other parents' judgment is harsh, but the author's actions were motivated by concern, not malice. The police response was appropriate, so there's no indication the author was wrong in contacting them.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were within their rights and responsibility to ensure the safety of another child. They didn't act with ill intent and followed proper procedures by contacting the police. The judgment from others doesn't define the correctness of the action. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
