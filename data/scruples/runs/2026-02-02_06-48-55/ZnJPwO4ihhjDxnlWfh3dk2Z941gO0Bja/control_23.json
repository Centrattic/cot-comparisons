Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a mom leaving her toddler alone at the park for 12 minutes. The author was pushing both their own kid and the other toddler's swing and noticed the other mom wasn't around. They called the police, which led to a wellness check. Others at the park judged the author for their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider laws and societal norms. In many places, leaving a child unattended in public can be considered neglect, especially if the child is very young and in a situation where they might be in danger. The toddler was under 2, in a high swing, and no one else was watching. The author acted out of concern for the child's safety, which is a valid reason. However, the other mom might argue that she was nearby or that the time wasn't long enough to constitute neglect. But 12 minutes is a significant amount of time for a young child in a public space with potential risks.\n\nThe police did respond with a wellness check, which suggests that the call wasn't baseless. The author's intent was to ensure the child's safety, not to cause trouble. The judgment from others at the park doesn't negate the author's concern. While some might find it extreme, the primary responsibility for a child's safety lies with the parent. The author took a responsible action by reporting a potentially hazardous situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong because their actions were motivated by concern for the child's well-being and they followed the appropriate steps by contacting authorities.\n"
