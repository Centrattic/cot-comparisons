Another mom came over, plopped her toddler in the swing next to my kid, pushed him a few times then disappeared. A few minutes passed before she came back, pushed him really hard in the swing and left again.\n\nI was still pushing my son in the swing, and I began pushing the other mom's toddler as well, while looking around for her. I couldn't see her at all. I kept an eye on the time, and after 7 minutes, I was getting worried for this toddler. I understand letting your kids run around without hovering, but this boy was under 2, and in a swing relatively high off the ground with no mom in sight. I became really concerned. I could see no evidence of anyone else watching the child. Nobody came up, and nobody else was watching him.\n\nSo, I called the non-emergency line for the police and asked about the situation. I was on the phone for at least 5 more minutes, and Mom still didn't show up.\n\nThey were going to send someone to check it out, and when I got off the phone, I saw the mom finally coming back. She had been gone at least 12 minutes. She had left her toddler alone for 12 minutes!\n\nI walked to another area of the park, and watched as the cops came. They had called me to confirm some details, and I mentioned that she had come back. They told me they would just do a \"wellness check\" on the child.\n\nThere were a few more people at the park, and a woman went over to another young mom with her son and said, \"Stay close to your baby! Someone just called the cops on this mom over here!\". Apparently this woman had heard the details, because she informed another parent that the cops were called because she left her kid alone for 12 minutes. The parent she told that to laughed and said, \"Who keeps track like that?!\" and essentially was laughing at me because I was concerned about the kid being left alone: \"Are they not a parent?! HAHA!\"\n\nI ended up leaving after that, because I felt really embarrassed. But I still feel like leaving a toddler alone in the park for 10+ minutes is dangerous. Sometimes there are strange people in the area, it's also right across the street from a public transit area. I was genuinely concerned for this little boy, it broke my heart to see him left alone like that.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police was in the wrong. The situation involves a mom leaving her toddler alone in a swing for 12 minutes. The key points here are the safety of the child and the appropriateness of calling the police.\n\nFirst, toddlers are vulnerable and can't take care of themselves. Leaving a child under 2 unsupervised, especially in a public place like a park, is generally considered neglectful. The author was concerned because the child was in a swing that's high off the ground, which adds risk if the child falls. The mother was gone for 12 minutes, which is a significant amount of time for a very young child. \n\nThe author took some steps to help by pushing the other child's swing while looking for the mom. When that didn't work, they called the non-emergency police line. The police responded with a wellness check, which seems appropriate given the situation. The fact that the police were involved suggests that their call was justified in the eyes of the authorities.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of judgment from other parents. The other parent laughed, implying that keeping track of time to that extent is excessive. But the author's concern isn't about timekeeping; it's about the child's safety. The police didn't take any punitive action beyond a wellness check, which might indicate they didn't see a crime, but it's also possible they wanted to ensure the child was okay.\n\nLegally, leaving a child unsupervised can vary by jurisdiction, but in many places, it's considered neglect if the child is left in a dangerous situation without supervision. The author acted out of concern for the child's well-being, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the police, but given the circumstances\u2014very young child, unsupervised for a long time, no other adults watching\u2014it's a reasonable action. The police's response was measured, so the author's call didn't lead to unnecessary intervention. \n\nThe embarrassment the author felt from others' reactions is unfortunate, but public safety should take precedence over personal feelings. The author's intent was to protect a vulnerable child, which is a commendable action. The other parents' dismissive attitude doesn't negate the potential risk involved.\n"
