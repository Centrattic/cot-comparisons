Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female member, Jane, feels excluded. The author argues that they mean the whole team when they say those terms and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\" Others, including the guy who accidentally excluded Jane, apologized and tried to adjust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of Jane. She's the one pointing out that these terms make her feel othered. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the effect on Jane is real. Language can have an impact beyond just the speaker's intent. Words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric, so when used in a group with women, they can unintentionally exclude them.\n\nThe author mentions that Jane suggested using \"team\" instead, and they all agreed to try. But then the author reverted to using \"lads\" again, dismissing Jane's feelings by calling them \"overly sensitive.\" That's problematic because it's not about sensitivity but about the inclusivity of language. The author also labels Jane's concerns as radical feminism, which might be a mischaracterization. Jane's feedback isn't about ideology but about feeling included.\n\nThe other members, including the one who made the comment, are taking Jane's side, which shows that the group is trying to adapt. The author's refusal to comply with the agreed-upon change could be seen as resistant to creating an inclusive environment. Even if the author thinks they're not being exclusionary, the consistent feedback from Jane indicates otherwise. It's important to respect others' feelings and adjust language to make everyone feel part of the group. So, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are contributing to an environment where a team member feels excluded. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jane's valid concerns and for using terms that perpetuate exclusion.\n"
