Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She's asked them to use more inclusive terms like \"team\" instead of \"boiz\" or \"guys\" because it makes her feel excluded. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys\" because they mean the whole team and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\" Another guy apologized for saying \"lads and Jane\" and agreed to use \"team.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's in a minority in the group, and the language used might make her feel like she doesn't belong. Even if the intention is to include her, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. When the guy said \"lads and Jane,\" it might have highlighted her difference rather than treating her as an equal part of the group. The fact that she's been asked to join shows the group values her, but their language could undermine that.\n\nThe author argues that Jane is being overly sensitive and that they're not giving in to radical feminism. But this seems dismissive of her feelings. Even if the intention is inclusive, the impact is what matters here. The other guy apologized and changed his language, which shows he recognized the issue. The author, on the other hand, is doubling down and using a derogatory term for feminism, which isn't helpful.\n\nInclusion often requires adjusting communication to make everyone feel valued. The author is using language that, while common, might not consider Jane's experience. The fact that she's a valuable team member as good as the rest means the group should strive to include her in all aspects, including language. The author's stance could come off as resistant to necessary changes for inclusivity, which might harm team cohesion.\n\nSo, considering the impact on Jane and the need for inclusive language, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
