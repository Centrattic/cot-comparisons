Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. \n\nFirst, the context is that Jane, a female player, joined a predominantly male team. She felt excluded when they used \"boiz\" and asked for more inclusive terms like \"team\". The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys\", arguing they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism\". Another guy apologized after using \"lads and Jane\", and the author is frustrated that others are supporting Jane.\n\nSo, the main issue is about inclusive language. The author thinks the terms are neutral and just refer to the team, but Jane feels excluded. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing to use those terms despite Jane's feedback.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might believe in free speech and that the terms aren't inherently exclusionary. On the other, Jane's experience shows that the terms make her feel othered. Even if the author's intent is inclusive, the impact matters. Inclusive language often requires adapting to avoid marginalizing others. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's valid feelings.\n\nSo, from a social dynamics perspective, the author could be in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's experience and are being resistant to change. The fact that others apologized suggests that the community values inclusivity. The author's stance might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over Jane's inclusion. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
