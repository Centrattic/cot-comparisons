Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, even after a teammate, Jane, expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. The initial term \"boiz\" was a typo or a way to refer to the group, but Jane felt excluded. The author and others agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then, someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it highlighted her as different. The author defends using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming they mean the whole team and are not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nThe key points here are about inclusive language and respect for others' feelings. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the words chosen have a history of being male-centric. Using \"lads\" and \"guys\" can unintentionally exclude women by reinforcing a male-dominated group identity. Jane's feedback is valid because she feels othered, which affects her sense of belonging. The author's dismissal of her feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" shows a lack of consideration for her experience. The fact that others are taking her side suggests that the group is trying to adjust their language for inclusivity, which is a positive step. The author's stance against changing the language, despite clear feedback, might be seen as resistant to creating a more inclusive environment. So, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
