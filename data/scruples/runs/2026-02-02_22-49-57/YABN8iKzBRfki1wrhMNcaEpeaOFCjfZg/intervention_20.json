Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, specifically when Jane, a female teammate, has asked them to use more inclusive language.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is 99% male, and Jane is the only female. She mentioned that phrases like \"well done boiz\" made her feel excluded. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, so even if intended to be inclusive, they might not be. Jane's response to the phrase \"Have fun lads and Jane\" indicates that she felt singled out, which makes sense because being addressed separately can highlight her difference in the group.\n\nThe author argues that they mean the whole team when using \"lads\" and \"guys\" and that they don't want to \"give in to radical feminism.\" This reasoning might come off as dismissive. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is valid. The fact that she's the only woman in the group and that others are taking her side suggests that the terms are problematic in practice, even if the intent is good.\n\nThe author's response to the situation by doubling down on their language use and dismissing Jane's feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" could be seen as invalidating her experience. Inclusion isn't just about intent but also about how others feel. The team's other members have agreed to try using \"team\" instead, showing they recognize the need for inclusivity. The author's stance might be seen as resistant to change, even if they mean well. So, while the author might not have ill intentions, their actions and words could be considered in the wrong because they're not considering the effect on Jane and are dismissing her valid feelings.\n"
