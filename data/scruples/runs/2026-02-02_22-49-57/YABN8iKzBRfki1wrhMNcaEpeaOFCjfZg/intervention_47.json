Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is part of an online team game that's mostly male. They invited a girl named Jane, who feels excluded when they use terms like \"lads\" and \"guys.\" She asked them to use \"team\" instead. The group agreed, but one guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which upset her again. The author then defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't cater to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized and said he'd try to use \"team\" next time.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're not doing anything wrong and that Jane is being too sensitive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider perspectives.\n\nFrom Jane's side, using terms like \"lads\" might make her feel excluded even if that's not the intention. She's in a minority in the group, so when the default term is male-oriented, it can be alienating. The author mentions that Jane finds it difficult to play in an all-male group, even if the group treats her well. So, maybe the issue isn't about being treated poorly but about feeling included in language.\n\nOn the author's side, they argue that they're using normal words and that Jane is being overly sensitive. They also mention that the other guy apologized and changed his approach. The author might feel that they're being unfairly asked to adjust their language for someone else's comfort.\n\nBut here's the thing: inclusive language is about making everyone feel part of the group. If Jane is the only woman and feels excluded by certain terms, it's reasonable to adjust the language to include her. The author's stance that they're not in the wrong might not consider the impact of their words, even if the intent was neutral. Intent vs. impact is a common point here. Even if the intent is to include everyone, the impact can be exclusionary.\n\nThe author also called Jane's concerns \"radical feminism,\" which could be seen as dismissive. That might not help the situation. The other guy apologized and tried to change, showing that some in the group acknowledge the issue. The author's resistance could make Jane feel like her feelings aren't valid, which isn't helpful for team cohesion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their language choice, while intended to be inclusive, still uses male-centric terms that exclude Jane. The fact that they dismiss her feelings as \"radical feminism\" adds to the problem. Even if they didn't mean to exclude, the effect is there, and the solution (using \"team\") is available. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
