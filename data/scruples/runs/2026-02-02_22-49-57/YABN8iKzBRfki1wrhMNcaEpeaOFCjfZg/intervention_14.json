Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is part of a mostly male online gaming team. They invited a girl, Jane, to join. Jane felt excluded when they used terms like \"boiz,\" \"lads,\" and \"guys.\" She suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed, but the author insists on using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism. Another guy apologized for using \"lads and Jane\" and will try to use \"team\" instead. The author feels the other guys are taking Jane's side, and thinks normal words shouldn't make people feel hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusive language and whether using terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" in a mixed group is exclusionary. Jane feels excluded, so the group initially agreed to use \"team.\" The author refuses, arguing that the terms are neutral and they mean the whole team. But Jane's point is that these terms are male-coded, even if used with good intent. The author might be right in intent, but the impact matters here. If the words make Jane feel othered, then even if the author's intention is inclusive, the words aren't working as intended.\n\nThe author's stance is that they shouldn't have to change \"normal words\" because of sensitivity. But in this case, Jane is part of the team and her inclusion is important. The author is dismissing her feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" and implying that they're not giving in to extremism. That could come off as invalidating her experience, which is a problem. Even if the author means well, the refusal to adapt might be the issue here. The other guys even apologized and changed their approach, so the author's resistance might be the sticking point.\n\nSo considering intent vs. impact, the author's use of terms that Jane finds exclusionary could be seen as wrong because it disregards her feelings of inclusion. The author is not malicious, but the behavior is causing harm. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author's intention isn't to exclude, so it's a matter of perspective. But in situations where someone's comfort and inclusion in a group is at stake, the onus is often on the group to adjust language to be inclusive, even if the original terms were neutral in intent.\n"
