Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group that includes a new female member, Jane. Jane has expressed discomfort with these terms, feeling excluded. The author defends using them, saying they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane was added to a group that's 99% male, and she's already had to request changes like using \"well done team\" instead of \"boiz.\" The other guy in the chat apologized for using \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it highlighted her as different. The author, however, insists on continuing to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they refer to the entire team and that people shouldn't be overly sensitive.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, the key issue is inclusivity. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric. Using them in a mixed group can make non-male members feel excluded, regardless of intent. The fact that Jane and others are taking her side suggests that the terms are indeed problematic for them. The author's stance that they're \"not giving in to radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive and could be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings.\n\nIn many social settings, especially in groups aiming for inclusivity, it's important to be mindful of language that might exclude others. While the author might not have ill intent, the impact on Jane is valid. The other member who apologized and agreed to use \"team\" shows a willingness to adjust for inclusivity, which the author is resisting.\n\nSo, considering that the author is aware of Jane's discomfort but refuses to change their language, the author might be in the wrong. The correct answer would be A (Yes).\n"
