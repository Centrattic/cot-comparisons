Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mixed-gender team in an online game where the majority are male. Jane, the female member, asked them to stop using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" because it made her feel excluded. The author of the post is defending their use of these terms, claiming it's just normal language and that they don't see why there's an issue, even calling it \"not giving in to radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane expressed that the language made her feel othered. The group agreed to try using \"team\" instead, but the author still uses terms like \"lads\" and \"guys.\" The key point here is whether the author's continued use of these terms, despite Jane's feedback, is wrong.\n\nThe author is in a minority (one female member) and the team is 99% male. The term \"lads\" is often associated with male-only groups, so when used in a mixed group, even if intended to include everyone, it can have the opposite effect. The author's insistence on using these terms might be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings. Even if the author's intention is inclusive, the impact on Jane is negative, which is a common issue in communication.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to \"give in to radical feminism,\" which is a problematic stance. It's important to acknowledge that Jane's feelings are valid and not a case of being overly sensitive. The fact that other team members are taking her side suggests that the author's perspective might not align with the group's current effort to be inclusive.\n\nIn conflict resolution, respecting others' feelings and adapting language to be inclusive is crucial. The author's refusal to adjust their language, despite clear feedback from Jane and the team's agreement to try using more inclusive terms, shows a lack of consideration. The author's justification that they're using \"normal words\" overlooks the specific context where such terms can exclude someone.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they are not respecting Jane's feelings and the group's effort to be inclusive. The terms they use, while common, are causing harm in this specific context, and changing them is a reasonable request.\n"
