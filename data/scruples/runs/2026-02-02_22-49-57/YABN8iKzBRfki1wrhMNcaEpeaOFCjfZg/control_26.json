Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. Jane, the female team member, has expressed feeling excluded when these terms are used, even though the author insists they mean the whole team.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author says they're using \"lads\" and \"guys\" to refer to the entire team, but Jane feels excluded. Even if the intention is inclusive, the impact is what matters here. Language can unintentionally exclude people if it doesn't reflect the group's diversity.\n\nThe term \"lads\" is typically male-oriented, and while \"guys\" is more gender-neutral, it's still a term that can make some people feel left out. The fact that Jane has already brought this up once and suggested alternatives like \"team\" shows she's made her feelings known. The author's response about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive and could alienate her further.\n\nThe other team members, including the one who initially used the term, have apologized and agreed to use more inclusive language. The author's insistence on continuing to use the old terms despite the feedback could be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings or the group's effort to be inclusive. It's important to recognize that inclusivity isn't about giving in to sensitivity but about creating a welcoming environment for everyone.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to exclude Jane, the continued use of terms that she finds exclusionary is likely the wrong approach. The correct choice here would be A, as the author is in the wrong for not adjusting their language despite feedback.\n"
