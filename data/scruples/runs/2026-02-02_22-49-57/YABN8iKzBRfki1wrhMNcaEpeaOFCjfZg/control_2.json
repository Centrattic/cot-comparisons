Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group that includes a new female team member, Jane.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is 99% male, and Jane is the only female. The group initially used male-dominated slang, which Jane found exclusionary. They agreed to use more inclusive terms like \"team\" after her feedback. Then, one member used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it highlighted her as different. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism. The other guy apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is frustrated that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about inclusivity and respect. The author's argument is that words like \"lads\" are just terms they use and not problematic, but Jane's experience is that these terms make her feel excluded. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact is what matters. The author might not see the issue because the team treats Jane well, but language plays a role in making someone feel part of a group. Using terms that reinforce gender divisions can be alienating, even if unintentionally. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as being overly sensitive or radical feminist might be undermining her valid experience. The other guy's apology and willingness to change shows he acknowledged the problem, whereas the author is resisting and justifying their language. So, the author's stance could be seen as inconsiderate of Jane's feelings and the broader effort to be inclusive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
