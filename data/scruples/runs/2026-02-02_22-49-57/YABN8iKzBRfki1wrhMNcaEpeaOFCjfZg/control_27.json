Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that Jane, a girl who joined the team, feels excluded by those terms and suggests using \"team\" instead. The author defends their use, saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism. Others apologized and changed their language, but the author sticks to their ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, so using them in a mixed group can unintentionally exclude women. Even if the intention is to be inclusive, the effect matters. Jane already mentioned feeling othered when \"lads and Jane\" was used, which the author might not fully grasp. The author's statement about not \"giving in to radical feminism\" comes off as dismissive, which isn't helpful. It's important to acknowledge that Jane's feelings are valid and that inclusive language fosters a better environment. The fact that others apologized and adjusted their language shows they recognized the issue. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as not respecting Jane's experience. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
