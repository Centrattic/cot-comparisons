Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation involves Jane, a female team member, who feels excluded by those terms and prefers \"team\" or \"people\" instead.\n\nFirst, the author defended their use of \"lads\" by saying they mean the whole team and that they aren't giving in to radical feminism. They also mentioned that other guys are taking Jane's side. The key issue here is whether the author's language is exclusionary despite their intentions.\n\nI need to consider the impact of the language. Even if the author's intent is to include everyone, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male and can make women feel excluded. Jane is the one pointing out that she feels othered, which is a valid feeling. The fact that the group agreed to try using \"team\" instead shows that there's a collective effort to be inclusive. The author's stance might come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings when she's the one who brought up the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the other guy apologized and changed his behavior, while the author is resisting. This resistance, even if well-meaning, might be seen as not valuing Jane's experience. The author's comment about \"overly sensitive people\" could be perceived as invalidating her feelings, which is a red flag. In a team setting, fostering inclusivity is important for everyone's comfort and collaboration. So, even if the author didn't mean to exclude, their continued use of terms that Jane finds exclusionary might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
