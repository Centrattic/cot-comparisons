Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is part of an online team game, which is mostly male. They invited a girl named Jane to join. The team used terms like \"well done boiz,\" but Jane felt excluded and suggested using \"team\" instead. The team agreed, and Jane felt she's part of the team. Then, a guy in the group used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The team is predominantly male, and Jane is the only female. The team made an effort to adjust their language when Jane pointed out that their initial terms made her feel excluded. The author is now resisting that change, insisting that using \"lads\" is okay because they mean the team. But Jane and others are feeling \"othered\" by the term. \n\nThe key here is about inclusive language and how words can affect people's sense of belonging. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the term \"lads\" is inherently male-centric. Including Jane's name in the group chat message as an afterthought (e.g., \"lads and Jane\") might make her feel singled out or not truly part of the group. It's about perception and the impact of language, not just intent.\n\nThe author mentions not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which could indicate a dismissive attitude towards Jane's feelings. This might be problematic because it's not about political correctness but about making someone feel welcome. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that there's a shift in understanding the importance of inclusive language.\n\nAlso, the person who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is doubling down. This could be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings and the team's prior agreement to use more inclusive terms. Even if the author's intention is good, the result is that Jane feels excluded, which is a problem. In such situations, it's often about adapting to make everyone feel included, even if it means changing long-standing habits. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance might be in the wrong because they're not acknowledging how their language affects Jane, even if the intention was to include. The responsibility is to adjust communication to foster inclusivity, especially in a group where the majority is male and the minority member has already expressed sensitivity to the language used.\n"
