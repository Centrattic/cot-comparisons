Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The team is mostly male, and they invited Jane, a female player. She feels excluded when they use those terms and suggests using \"team\" instead. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they shouldn't have to give in to radical feminism. Others in the group apologized, but the author is upset that other guys are taking Jane's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's the only girl in a mostly male group, and she's pointing out that the language makes her feel excluded. Even if the author and others intend to include her, the words \"lads\" and \"guys\" are typically male-dominated terms. Using them might unintentionally reinforce the idea that the group is for males, which could make her feel like an outsider. The fact that she's already mentioned it's difficult to play in an all-male group suggests she's in a minority and might feel more sensitive to such language.\n\nThen there's the author's defense. They say they're not giving in to radical feminism. That's a problematic stance because it dismisses Jane's valid feelings as part of a political movement rather than acknowledging her experience. It's important to recognize that inclusivity isn't about political correctness but about making everyone feel respected and included. The author's statement that others are \"overly sensitive\" also shows a lack of empathy. Even if the intention is good, the impact on Jane is real.\n\nThe other members apologized and tried to adjust, showing they take her feelings seriously. The author, however, is doubling down on their position. This could create a hostile environment for Jane, making her feel like her concerns are not valued. The group's willingness to use \"team\" instead shows they prioritize her inclusion, while the author resists change despite the negative effect.\n\nIn terms of social norms, using inclusive language is generally encouraged to ensure everyone feels part of the group. The author's insistence on traditional terms without considering the impact might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the team is mostly male, the presence of a female member requires some level of adjustment to make her feel included. The key point is that language affects perceptions and feelings, and it's about respecting others' experiences even if the intention is positive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not considering Jane's feelings and is dismissing her valid concerns. The correct approach would be to use inclusive language that makes everyone feel part of the group. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
