Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The user is part of an online team that's mostly male, and they added a girl named Jane. Jane told them that using \"boiz\" or \"lads\" makes her feel excluded, so they tried to switch to \"team\" or other inclusive terms. But then one guy used \"lads and Jane\" which she found worse because it made her feel singled out. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, the initial issue was Jane feeling excluded when they used male-centric terms. They agreed to use more inclusive language. Then another member tried to include her by adding her name, but that backfired because it highlighted her as different. The author is now defending the use of traditionally male terms, even though the team agreed to change. \n\nSo, the key points here: Jane is part of the team, and she's pointing out that the language used by the majority male group doesn't include her. The author's argument is that they mean the whole team when they say \"lads,\" but Jane still feels excluded. Adding her name in the team chat might have been an attempt to include her, but it actually did the opposite by separating her from the group. \n\nThe author is now dismissing Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive\" and using the term \"radical feminism,\" which seems like a red herring. The real issue isn't about political correctness but about making Jane feel part of the team. The team had already agreed to adjust their language for inclusivity, so the author's stance of continuing to use the old terms despite the agreement is a problem. \n\nAlso, the author is in a minority here. The other guy apologized and changed his behavior, and some other guys are taking Jane's side. The author's refusal to adapt might be alienating Jane further. Even if the intention was to include everyone, the impact is what matters. So, the author is not considering Jane's perspective and is dismissing her valid feelings of exclusion. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they are not respecting Jane's need for inclusive language and are undermining the team's effort to make her feel welcome. The answer should be A.\n"
