Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. They have a team that's mostly male, and they invited a girl named Jane. She asked them to stop using those terms because it made her feel excluded. The author argues that they mean the whole team when they use those words and that they shouldn't have to change their language to accommodate \"overly sensitive\" people.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is trying to be inclusive, but Jane feels excluded by the language. The author is defending their use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which are traditionally male terms. The key point here is whether using such terms in a mixed group is appropriate, even if the intention is to include everyone.\n\nI remember that inclusive language is important in mixed groups. Terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" can sometimes be seen as excluding non-male members, even if that's not the intent. The author mentions that Jane is part of the team and as good as any of the guys, but the language still makes her feel othered. The other guy in the group also tried to include her by adding her name, but that backfired because it highlighted her as separate.\n\nThe author's response is that they shouldn't have to change their language for sensitive people. However, if someone is feeling excluded, even if the intent is not to exclude, the impact matters. The term \"radical feminism\" is used here, which might be a bit of a loaded term and could indicate the author's resistance to changing their language based on feminist perspectives. \n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author's intention is to include the team, the effect on Jane is negative. The fact that multiple people, including Jane and another team member, have expressed discomfort suggests that the language is problematic. The author is not considering the feelings and experiences of Jane, which is a key part of being inclusive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong by continuing to use terms that exclude a team member, even if unintentionally. The correct answer would be A.\n"
