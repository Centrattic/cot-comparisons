Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mixed-gender team in an online game where the group initially used male-centric terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which made Jane, the female teammate, feel excluded. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The author of the post defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Another member apologized for saying \"lads and Jane,\" while the author is resisting changing the language.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of inclusive language. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is real\u2014she feels excluded. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author's intention is to include the team, but the words used don't align with that intention in Jane's experience. \n\nThen there's the part where the author mentions \"not giving in to radical feminism.\" This could come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings. It's important to acknowledge that advocating for inclusive language isn't about being overly sensitive but about creating a welcoming environment. The phrase \"radical feminism\" might be a red flag here, as it's a derogatory term often used to mischaracterize feminist views.\n\nThe other team member apologized and adjusted their language, showing they recognized the issue. The author, however, is doubling down. Even if the group agreed to try \"team\" previously, the author is not following through. Consistency matters in making someone feel included. If the team agreed to change, the author's refusal could be seen as undermining the team's effort to be inclusive.\n\nAlso, the surprise that other guys are taking Jane's side might indicate a lack of understanding about how language affects people. It's possible the author isn't considering Jane's perspective and is focusing on maintaining a certain language habit rather than her experience.\n\nIn terms of communication strategies, Jane clearly expressed her discomfort, which is a valid reason for the team to adjust their language. The author's comment about \"overly sensitive people\" might be invalidating Jane's feelings, which is a problem. Even if the author didn't mean to exclude Jane, the words have that effect, so the responsibility is on the speaker to adjust to ensure everyone feels included.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have malicious intent, the continued use of excluding language and the dismissive attitude towards Jane's feelings could place them in the wrong. The key issue is respecting Jane's experience and the team's agreement to use inclusive terms. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
