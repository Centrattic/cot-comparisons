Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The team is mostly male, and they added Jane, a female player. Jane feels excluded when they use those terms and suggested saying \"team\" instead. The author defended using the terms, saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. Another guy apologized for using \"lads and Jane\" because she felt \"othered.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's in a minority in the group, and the language used might make her feel like she doesn't belong. Even if the intention isn't there, the impact is important. The author's response was to not change their language and accuse Jane of being overly sensitive. That seems dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" tried to include her but ended up singling her out, which Jane found worse. That shows the difficulty in trying to include without understanding the right way. The author, however, is defending the use of terms that exclude Jane, even after she's expressed discomfort. \n\nUsing \"lads\" or \"guys\" in a mixed group is a common issue. These terms are traditionally male, so using them can unintentionally exclude women. The author argues they mean the whole team, but the problem is that the terms don't inherently include everyone. The fact that Jane feels othered is a valid concern. The author's refusal to adapt their language despite Jane's feedback might be seen as not respecting her feelings.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which could be a problematic stance. It's possible they're dismissing legitimate concerns as being part of an ideology rather than acknowledging the real feelings of a team member. The other guys taking Jane's side suggests that there's a consensus that her feelings are valid.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's perspective, dismissing her valid feelings, and using language that excludes her even after being told it's hurtful. The fact that the group is mostly male and Jane is an exception might mean she's more sensitive to exclusion. The author's attitude of not changing their language and calling others \"overly sensitive\" is not supportive in this context.\n"
