Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The author is part of a team where most are male, and they've included a girl named Jane. Jane felt excluded when the team used male-centric terms, so they agreed to use \"team\" instead. But then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse.\n\nThe author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism. The question is whether that's wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's feelings. She's in a minority here as the only girl. The term \"lads\" is definitely male-specific. Even if the author intends to include everyone, the term itself might make Jane feel like she's not part of the group. Language can be exclusionary even if it's not intentional. The fact that Jane has already mentioned difficulty in all-male groups suggests she's dealing with being the only woman, so inclusive language is important for her sense of belonging.\n\nThe author's response was to push back against changing the language, calling it \"radical feminism,\" which might come off as dismissive. Even if they treat her well otherwise, the language is part of the team dynamic. The other guy apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is resisting. \n\nSo, the key points are: Jane's feelings are valid, the term is exclusionary, and the author's resistance to adjusting shows a lack of consideration for her experience. The author's argument that it's just \"normal words\" ignores the impact on Jane. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not acknowledging Jane's valid feelings and are maintaining language that excludes her, even if unintentionally. Answer A.\n"
