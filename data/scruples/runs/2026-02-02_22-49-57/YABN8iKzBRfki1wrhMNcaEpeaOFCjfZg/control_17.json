Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where Jane, a woman, feels excluded. The author defends using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand Jane's perspective. She's the only girl in a mostly male team. The group uses \"boiz,\" which she finds exclusionary, so they switch to \"team\" to include her. Then someone says \"lads and Jane,\" which she feels is othering. The author insists on using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming they mean the whole team. \n\nI think the key here is about inclusive language. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male. Using them in a mixed group can unintentionally exclude women. Jane has already mentioned that it makes her feel not part of the team. The author's argument that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism\" seems dismissive of Jane's feelings.\n\nThe other guy who said \"lads and Jane\" was trying to be inclusive by mentioning her specifically, but that might have highlighted her as different. The author, however, continues to use terms that don't include her, arguing it's just normal language. But if the team agreed to use \"team\" instead, the author is not respecting that agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"overly sensitive people\" might be invalidating Jane's feelings. It's important to consider how language affects others, even if the intention is good. The fact that some other guys are taking her side suggests that maybe the author isn't seeing the issue clearly.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is using language that Jane finds exclusionary, despite her being part of the team. The author's refusal to adapt the language, even after others have agreed to change, might be the problem. Inclusion isn't just about intention but also about impact. If Jane feels othered, the language should be adjusted to make her feel included. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
