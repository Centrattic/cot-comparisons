Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially when a female teammate, Jane, has expressed feeling excluded by such language. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. She's been asked to join, and initially, they used terms like \"boiz,\" which she found exclusionary. They agreed to switch to \"well done team.\" Then, another member used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane again found problematic. The author defended the use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusive language and the impact of words on others. The author argues that they're using normal words and that Jane is being overly sensitive. However, Jane has clearly communicated that these terms make her feel excluded. The other guy apologized for his comment and adjusted his language, but the author is resisting.\n\nFrom a social perspective, there's a growing emphasis on inclusive language to ensure everyone feels respected and part of the group. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, and even if the intent is to be inclusive, the effect might still be exclusionary. The fact that Jane has raised this twice suggests that the language is indeed causing her discomfort.\n\nThe author's response of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's legitimate feelings. It's not about being politically correct but about acknowledging her experience and making her feel included. The other team members are also taking her side, indicating that there's a collective effort to be more inclusive, which the author is resisting.\n\nIn such situations, the correct approach is often to listen to the affected person's experience and adjust communication accordingly. So, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's feelings and the group's agreement to be more inclusive. Their stance could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over Jane's inclusion, which is the opposite of what a team dynamic should foster.\n"
