Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves team communication where Jane, a female team member, feels excluded when the group uses terms like \"lads\" or \"guys.\" The author defends using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She's been told that using \"lads\" makes her feel excluded. The author insists that the terms are inclusive, but Jane's experience suggests otherwise. The other member who used \"lads and Jane\" was sorry and will change, but the author is doubling down.\n\nI should consider the impact of language. Even if the intention is inclusive, the effect matters if it makes someone feel left out. The author's use of \"lads\" might be part of a male-dominated culture that Jane isn't part of. The key here is that Jane has already expressed discomfort, and the author is dismissing her feelings as being \"overly sensitive.\" That's a red flag. \n\nAlso, the author uses the term \"radical feminism,\" which might be a way to deflect valid concerns. It's important to note that Jane's experience is legitimate. Even if the author believes they're not excluding her, the fact that Jane feels excluded means there's an issue. The other team members are taking her side, showing that the author's stance is out of step with the group.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author is not considering Jane's perspective and is invalidating her feelings. The correct approach would be to adapt language to be inclusive, as the team agreed to do. By refusing to do so, the author is contributing to an environment where Jane doesn't feel fully accepted. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
