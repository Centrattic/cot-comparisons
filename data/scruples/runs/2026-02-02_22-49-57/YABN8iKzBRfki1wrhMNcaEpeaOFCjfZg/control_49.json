Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The user is part of an online team game that's mostly male, and they invited a girl named Jane. Jane feels excluded when they use terms like \"boiz\" or \"lads,\" so she suggested using \"team\" instead. The author and others agreed to try, but the author later says they're going to keep using those terms and even mentions not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the words \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric. When there's a woman in the group, using those terms can make her feel like an outsider. Jane pointed out that being called \"lads and Jane\" made her feel \"othered,\" which means she was singled out as different. That's a valid feeling, right? The group had already agreed to use more inclusive terms after Jane's initial feedback, so the author's refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe author argues that they mean the whole team when using those terms, but intent doesn't always override impact. If the words make someone feel excluded, even if that's not the intention, the effect is still real. The other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is resisting, even calling it \"overly sensitive.\" That could be seen as not taking Jane's valid concerns seriously.\n\nAlso, the fact that the team is mostly male might mean that the default communication style is male-centric. Including a woman might require some adjustments to ensure she feels part of the group. The author's stance seems to be about personal choice in language, but in a team setting, especially when someone has asked for a change, it's about mutual respect.\n\nSo, the author is using language that excludes Jane, even after she explained why it's a problem. By refusing to adjust, they're not respecting her feelings and the team's prior agreement. That does make them at least partially at fault. The other members taking Jane's side might indicate that their actions are indeed hurtful, even if unintended. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
