Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after a female teammate, Jane, expressed feeling excluded by such terms.\n\nFirst, the context: the team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She asked them to avoid terms like \"boiz\" because it made her feel like she didn't belong. The group agreed to try \"team\" instead. However, the author continues to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Another member apologized for using \"lads and Jane\" and is trying to adjust. The author feels that Jane is being overly sensitive.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Using terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" in a male-dominated group can inadvertently exclude others who aren't part of that gendered term. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact is what matters here. Jane has already asked for a change because it made her uncomfortable. The author's insistence on using those terms despite the feedback could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe author's argument that they're not \"giving in to radical feminism\" might be an overgeneralization. It's more about respecting someone's comfort and creating an inclusive environment. The fact that others have started to adjust their language suggests that there's a collective effort to make Jane feel included. The author's resistance could hinder that effort.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"othered\" used by Jane when someone said \"lads and Jane\" implies that being singled out in that way made her feel different or excluded. The author's continued use of gendered terms, even if meant to be inclusive, might not align with creating a welcoming space for Jane. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention is good, the impact on Jane is negative. In such cases, adjusting language to respect others' feelings is a sign of consideration. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but their actions do contribute to Jane's discomfort. Therefore, it's more about acknowledging her feelings and adapting for inclusivity. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting Jane's valid concerns for inclusion.\n"
