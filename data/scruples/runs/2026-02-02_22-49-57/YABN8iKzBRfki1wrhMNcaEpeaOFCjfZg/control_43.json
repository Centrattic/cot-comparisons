Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author plays an online team game that's 99% male. They invited a girl named Jane to join. After matches, they used words like \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, a guy in the group messaged \"Have fun lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse because it singled her out. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys\" by saying they mean the whole team and they aren't giving in to radical feminism. The other guy apologized and said he'd use \"team\" now. The author is surprised others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. Jane was the only girl in a male-dominated group. She felt excluded by the use of \"lads\" and \"boiz,\" which are typically male terms. She asked for more inclusive language, and the group initially agreed. Then another member made a comment that included \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found problematic. The author is standing by their use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't have to change because someone is overly sensitive.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, inclusive language is important in mixed groups. Even if someone doesn't intend to exclude, the words they use can have that effect. The author's insistence on using terms that Jane finds exclusionary, despite her feedback and the group's previous agreement to try more inclusive terms, suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact of the words matters. Jane's experience is valid, and the fact that other members are supporting her might indicate that the group as a whole is recognizing the need for inclusivity.\n\nThe author's comment about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" could be seen as dismissive of Jane's legitimate concerns. It's possible the author is misinterpreting Jane's feedback as being about political correctness rather than genuine feelings of exclusion. The fact that another member apologized and changed his language shows that others are taking her concerns seriously, which the author isn't. \n\nTherefore, the author is not considering the impact of their language on Jane's sense of belonging, even if the intention is inclusion. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they are not respecting Jane's valid feelings and the group's prior agreement to use more inclusive terms.\n"
