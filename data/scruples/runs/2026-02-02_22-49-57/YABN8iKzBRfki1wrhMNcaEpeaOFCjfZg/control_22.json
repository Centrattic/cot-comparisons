Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the AITA question) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation involves Jane, a female team member who feels excluded by these terms. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She's already expressed discomfort with terms like \"boiz\" and was upset when someone addressed the group as \"lads and Jane.\" The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys\" by saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nNow, the key points here are about inclusion and respect. Even if the terms are used with good intentions, if they make a team member feel excluded or othered, it's a problem. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive,\" which isn't helpful. Language can have an impact beyond the speaker's intent. \n\nAlso, the fact that other team members took Jane's side suggests that there's a broader awareness of the issue. The author's refusal to adapt, despite Jane's valid concerns and the team's agreement to use more inclusive terms, shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nEven if the author believes the words are neutral, the effect on Jane is real. The term \"lads\" can create an in-group/out-group dynamic, making her feel she doesn't belong. The author's insistence on using these terms, despite the team's prior agreement to avoid them, undermines that agreement and Jane's inclusion.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions and words contribute to a hostile environment for Jane. The right approach would be to listen to her concerns and adjust language to be more inclusive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
