Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that Jane, the girl in the team, feels excluded when they use those terms. The author argues that they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's feelings. She's the one who's feeling excluded, so her perspective is important. The term \"lads\" is typically male-oriented, so using it in a mixed group might not be inclusive. The author says they treat her well, but language can impact inclusion even if intentions are good.\n\nThe other guy apologized and tried to include her by adding her name, but Jane found that even more exclusionary. That's interesting because sometimes people try to include by adding names but end up highlighting the difference. The author is sticking with the terms, claiming they refer to the whole team, but if Jane feels othered, maybe the terms aren't as neutral as he thinks.\n\nThe author mentions \"normal words,\" but what's normal can vary. Inclusion is about respecting others' feelings, so even if the words are common, they might not be appropriate in this context. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests there's a group consensus that the terms are problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because using inclusive language is about respecting others' experiences and making them feel part of the group. The author's insistence on using those terms despite Jane's feedback could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
