Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The scenario is that a girl, Jane, joined a mostly male team. The team uses terms like \"boiz\" and Jane found that exclusive. Then, when someone said \"Have fun lads and Jane\", Jane felt 'othered'. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys\", saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points here are about inclusivity, language, and perception. The author argues that the terms are just slang and they mean the whole team. However, Jane feels excluded when these terms are used, even when others apologize and try to adjust.\n\nLanguage plays a big role in how people feel part of a group. Terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, even if used informally. When a mixed group is present, using gendered language can unintentionally exclude members who don't identify with that gender. The fact that the team agreed to use \"team\" instead after Jane's initial feedback shows that they recognized her discomfort and tried to adapt. However, the author is resistant, calling it \"radical feminism,\" which might be a dismissal of Jane's valid feelings.\n\nThe author's stance is that they should use \"normal words\" without worrying about others' sensitivities. But the issue isn't about being overly sensitive\u2014it's about creating an inclusive environment. If Jane feels othered, even once, it's a sign that the language might not be inclusive. The other guy who apologized and adjusted his language is taking responsibility, which the author isn't. The author's comment about not giving in to radical feminism could be seen as invalidating Jane's experience.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, using language that makes someone feel excluded, even if it's unintentional, is problematic. The author's refusal to consider Jane's perspective and insistence on using terms that she finds exclusive could be seen as not being in the right. The correct answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
