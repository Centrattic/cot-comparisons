Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of an online team game that's 99% male players. They invited Jane, a girl, to join. After matches, they used terms like \"well done boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, a guy in the chat used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse, making her feel \"othered.\" The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism. The guy who said \"lads and Jane\" apologized and said he'd use \"team\" next time. The author is confused why others are taking Jane's side and feels it's about being overly sensitive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the use of terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" which Jane finds exclusionary. Even though the group is mostly male, Jane is part of the team and the words used can affect her sense of belonging. The author argues that they're using the words to refer to the whole team, but the problem is that for Jane, these terms don't include her. The phrase \"lads and Jane\" explicitly separates her, making her feel singled out or not part of the group.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they should be able to use \"normal words\" without others feeling hurt. However, language and inclusivity are about how words are perceived by others, not just the speaker's intent. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, if the terms are making Jane feel excluded, then there's a valid concern. The term \"lads\" is traditionally male-centric, so using it in a mixed group might inadvertently exclude women. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as \"overly sensitive\" is problematic because it invalidates her experience and doesn't acknowledge the impact of language on inclusivity.\n\nThe guy who said \"lads and Jane\" tried to correct himself after being called out, showing that he recognized the issue. The author, however, is doubling down, claiming not to give in to \"radical feminism,\" which is a loaded term and suggests that Jane's concerns are extreme or politically motivated rather than genuine. This defensiveness and refusal to adapt could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's perspective and are prioritizing their own communication style over her comfort and inclusion.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jane is part of the team and the group has already agreed to try using more inclusive terms like \"team\" shows that there's a collective effort to be inclusive. The author's resistance to this change, despite the team's agreement, might be seen as undermining the effort to make Jane feel welcome. The author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" is a dismissive tactic that doesn't address Jane's valid feelings and could be perceived as being in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, inclusivity often requires adjusting language to be considerate of all group members. The author's stance might be based on a misunderstanding of what inclusivity entails. They see it as a matter of words versus the intent, but the reality is that language plays a significant role in creating an inclusive environment. The author's refusal to adjust their language, even after Jane and others have expressed discomfort, suggests a lack of empathy and consideration for her feelings.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions and responses indicate that they are not considering Jane's perspective and are dismissing her feelings as overreactions. This defensiveness and insistence on using terms that exclude her, despite the team's agreement to be more inclusive, likely makes them the person in the wrong.\n"
