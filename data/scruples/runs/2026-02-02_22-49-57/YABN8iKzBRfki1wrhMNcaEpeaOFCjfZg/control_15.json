Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for using \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that there's a girl, Jane, in a mostly male team who's been asking for more inclusive language. The author defended using \"lads\" by saying they mean the whole team and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane is the only girl in the team and has expressed discomfort with terms that exclude her. The other guy apologized and agreed to use \"team\" or \"people,\" but the author is standing their ground, even using the term \"radical feminism\" which is a bit of a red flag. That term is often used to dismiss valid concerns about gender inclusivity.\n\nThe key point here is intent versus impact. The author claims to mean the whole team, but the impact on Jane is that she feels excluded. Even if the intention is inclusive, the words being used have a history of being male-centric. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, and using them in a mixed group can make non-male members feel othered, even if that's not the intention. The fact that Jane has already mentioned it's hard to be in an all-male group suggests that inclusivity is a real issue here.\n\nThe author's response to the situation by doubling down and dismissing Jane's feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" shows a lack of empathy. It's important to acknowledge that language affects people differently, and creating an inclusive environment requires making adjustments, even if those adjustments seem minor to others. The fact that other team members are also taking Jane's side indicates that the community is shifting towards more inclusive language, which the author is resisting.\n\nUsing phrases like \"radical feminism\" is problematic because it frames Jane's request as an extreme political stance rather than a legitimate desire to feel included. This kind of language can be dismissive and invalidating. The correct approach would be to listen to Jane's experience and adapt the language to make her feel part of the team, even if that means changing terms that have been used in the past.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's feelings and the impact of their words, and instead are defending exclusionary language by claiming it's inclusive. The solution is to use inclusive terms that everyone is comfortable with, which \"team\" or \"everyone\" would be, rather than insisting on terms that have a history of excluding certain groups.\n"
