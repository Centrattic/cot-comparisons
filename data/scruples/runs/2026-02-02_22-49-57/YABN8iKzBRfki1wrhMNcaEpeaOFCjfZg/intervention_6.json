Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation involves Jane, a female team member, who feels excluded when these terms are used. The author argues that they mean the whole team when using such terms and are not backing down to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She's already made it clear that terms like \"lads\" make her feel excluded. The author and others tried to adjust to \"well done team\" after her initial request, but then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found even worse. The author then defends their use of the terms, saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and communication. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane matters. Using terms that are traditionally male-only can make someone from an underrepresented group feel like they don't belong. The author's stance of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might be a red flag, suggesting they're dismissing Jane's feelings as overly sensitive rather than acknowledging valid concerns about inclusivity.\n\nThe other guy apologized and agreed to use \"team\" instead. The author, however, isn't budging. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing to use those terms despite Jane's discomfort. The author's argument hinges on intent versus impact. While intent is important, the impact on Jane's experience as a team member is significant. Inclusive language is about creating a welcoming environment for everyone, even if some terms are considered neutral or friendly by default.\n\nSo, even if the author doesn't see the issue, Jane's experience shows that the terms are exclusionary. The author's refusal to adapt could be seen as not respecting her feelings and maintaining an inclusive team environment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not adjusting their language to be inclusive, even if their intention was neutral.\n"
