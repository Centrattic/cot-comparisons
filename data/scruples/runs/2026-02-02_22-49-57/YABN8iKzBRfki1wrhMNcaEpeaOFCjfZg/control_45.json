Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group after a female teammate, Jane, expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the team is mostly male, and they asked Jane to join. They used male-centric terms like \"boiz\" before, which she found exclusionary. They agreed to switch to \"team\" or \"well done team\" instead. Then, a guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse, making her feel othered. The author argues that they should use normal words without being overly sensitive. The other guy apologized and said he'd try to say \"team\" next time.\n\nSo, the main issue is about inclusive language. The author is defending the use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" despite Jane's feedback. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong by not respecting Jane's preference and instead dismissing her feelings as over-sensitivity. \n\nIn many situations, when someone from an underrepresented group (like women in a male-dominated space) expresses discomfort with certain terms, it's considered respectful to adjust language to be more inclusive. The team had already agreed to use \"team\" after Jane's initial feedback. The author's stance of refusing to adjust and calling it \"radical feminism\" seems dismissive of Jane's valid feelings. \n\nEven if the author's intent wasn't to exclude Jane, the impact of the language matters. The fact that Jane feels othered is significant. The author's response not only ignores her feelings but also invalidates her experience, which can be harmful. \n\nThe other guy apologized and tried to make amends, showing he's more responsive to feedback. The author's refusal to comply with a mutual agreement and using a derogatory term (\"radical feminism\") suggests a lack of empathy and openness to change. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not respecting the team's agreement and Jane's boundaries, which perpetuates an exclusionary environment despite good intentions.\n"
