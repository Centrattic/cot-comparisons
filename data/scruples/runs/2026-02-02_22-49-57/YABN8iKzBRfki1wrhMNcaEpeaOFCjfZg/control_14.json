Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They play an online game with mostly male players. Jane, a female player, joined the team. Initially, they used \"boiz\" which she found exclusionary. She suggested using \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed. Then, a guy in the group used \"lads and Jane\" in a message. Jane felt it was worse, making her feel \"othered.\" The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized and said he'd use \"team\" or \"people\" in the future. The author is upset that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo, the author's position is that they're not wrong for using those terms, thinking they're inclusive, and that Jane is being overly sensitive. The key here is understanding the impact of the words \"lads\" and \"guys.\" While these terms are commonly used in male-dominated groups, they can exclude those not part of the traditional group. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the effect matters. Jane's feedback was that these terms make her feel like she doesn't belong. The author dismisses her feelings as \"radical feminism,\" which is a problematic approach because it invalidates her experience.\n\nThe other guy acknowledged the issue and apologized, showing he's willing to adjust. The author, however, is not backing down. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main point is whether the language used, despite good intentions, is exclusionary. In inclusive environments, even if unintentional, using language that makes others feel excluded is considered wrong. The author's refusal to change and dismissing Jane's feelings as overly sensitive suggests they are not taking her valid concerns seriously. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they are not considering the impact of their words on Jane and are resisting inclusion despite feedback. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
