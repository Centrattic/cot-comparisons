Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group after a female teammate, Jane, expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane joined them. They used to say \"well done boiz,\" which made her feel excluded. They agreed to say \"well done team\" instead. Then, one member wrote \"Have fun lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it highlighted her as different. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism. Others apologized and changed their language, but the author is resisting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are about inclusive language and respect. Jane felt excluded by the terms \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which are typically male-oriented. Even though the author intends to include everyone, the words themselves might not convey that. The author's stance is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to accommodate overly sensitive people. But Jane's experience is valid because the language made her feel othered.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. Inclusive language often requires adjusting to make everyone feel welcome. The author is using terms that may not be inclusive, even if they don't mean to exclude. The fact that Jane left the team if they can't adjust their language suggests that the author's words have real consequences. The author's argument about not giving in to radical feminism might be a way to dismiss Jane's valid feelings. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's perspective and the impact of their words, even if unintended.\n\nBut wait, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. They might believe that the intent matters more than the impact. However, in these situations, the impact is what defines inclusivity. Even if the intent is good, the effect is harmful. The author's use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" continues to exclude Jane, despite previous agreement to use more inclusive terms. The fact that others have changed their language and apologized shows they value Jane's feelings, while the author is resisting, which could be seen as not respecting her needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not making an effort to be inclusive, even if they mean well.\n"
