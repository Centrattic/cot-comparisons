Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, even after a teammate, Jane, expressed that it made her feel excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The team is mostly male, and they added Jane, a female player. Initially, they used \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary, so they switched to \"team.\" But then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which she again found problematic. The author argued that they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Others in the group apologized and tried to adjust, but the author stands by their choice.\n\nSo, the key points here are about language and inclusivity. The author is using terms that have traditionally been male-centric (\"lads,\" \"guys\") and feels it's acceptable because they mean the entire team. However, Jane's experience is that these terms make her feel like an outsider. The author's stance is that they shouldn't have to change their language for overly sensitive people.\n\nI remember that inclusive language is often about acknowledging others' feelings and experiences. Even if the intention is to be inclusive, the impact matters. If Jane feels excluded, then the language might not be as inclusive as the speaker thinks. The fact that the group previously changed from \"boiz\" to \"team\" after Jane's feedback shows that they did consider her feelings before. Now the author is resisting the change again, perhaps seeing it as unnecessary.\n\nThere's also the aspect of not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which might be a dismissive attitude towards Jane's valid concerns. The author might be unintentionally perpetuating an environment where Jane doesn't feel fully included. The other members apologized and tried to adjust, which suggests that they recognize the importance of inclusivity, even if the author doesn't.\n\nSo, the author's argument is about intent versus impact. Even if the intent is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is negative. Language can be a subtle but significant factor in how individuals feel in a group. By not changing their language, the author might be contributing to Jane feeling othered, even if they don't see it as a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that \"lads\" and \"guys\" are just casual terms and that Jane is overreacting. But in reality, language evolves, and terms that were once considered neutral can have different connotations now. The key is respecting Jane's feelings and understanding that inclusivity isn't about changing language for the sake of it, but about creating a welcoming environment for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be good, the impact on Jane's experience is negative. The responsibility is to foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not adjusting their language despite Jane's feedback.\n"
