Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group, specifically after a female teammate, Jane, expressed feeling excluded by such language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and they added a female member. Jane initially told them that terms like 'boiz' made her feel excluded, so they agreed to use 'team' instead. Then, when a teammate used 'lads and Jane', she felt 'othered' again. The author defended using 'lads' and 'guys', saying they mean the whole team and don't want to conform to 'radical feminism'. The other guy apologized and said he'd use 'team' next time.\n\nThe author's stance is that they shouldn't have to change their language just because someone is sensitive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a communication perspective, when someone expresses feeling excluded by certain language, even if unintended, it's generally considered respectful to adjust to be inclusive. The team had already agreed to use more inclusive terms after Jane's first complaint. The author's refusal to change, despite Jane's continued discomfort, could be seen as not valuing her feelings. The use of 'lads' is traditionally male-oriented, so including Jane in that term might not actually include her in the group's identity, hence making her feel othered.\n\nThe author's argument that they mean the whole team when using 'lads' might not align with how the term is perceived. The term 'lads' is culturally associated with a male group, so even if the intention is inclusion, the effect is exclusion. The author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" might also come off as dismissive of Jane's valid concerns, which could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their language isn't malicious and that Jane is overreacting. However, in inclusive environments, it's often about making space for everyone's comfort. The fact that the other guy apologized and adjusted his language shows that some team members recognize the issue. The author's resistance could be seen as not taking Jane's feelings seriously, which is a problem even if unintended.\n\nSo, considering the impact of language on inclusivity and the team's prior agreement to adjust, the author's continued use of terms that exclude Jane likely makes them in the wrong. The key here is the effect on the person expressing discomfort, not just the intent.\n"
