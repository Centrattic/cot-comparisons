Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to use \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female team member, Jane, finds it exclusionary. The author's main point is that they mean the whole team when they say those terms and don't want to give in to what they call \"radical feminism.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. Jane has already expressed discomfort with terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads,\" suggesting alternatives like \"team.\" The group initially agreed to try that. Then, when a guy used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt even more excluded. The author is now defending the use of these terms, arguing that they're just normal words and that Jane is being overly sensitive.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, if someone has already indicated that certain language makes them feel excluded, continuing to use that language despite knowing their feelings could be seen as dismissive. The author claims that they mean the whole team, but the impact of the words matters. Even if the intention is inclusive, the effect is what's causing Jane to feel othered. This is a classic case of \"intent vs. impact.\"\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the group is 99% male, so it's possible that the default language they use is male-centric, which can unintentionally marginalize the few female members. The term \"lads\" is particularly gendered and might reinforce a male-dominated culture, making it harder for Jane to feel like a true part of the team, even if she's treated well otherwise.\n\nThe author's response to the situation by doubling down and accusing Jane of being overly sensitive might come off as invalidating her feelings. It's important to listen to feedback about how one's actions affect others, especially when it's about inclusion and belonging. The fact that some other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that there's a growing awareness of the issue within the group.\n\nHowever, the author isn't using the term to exclude Jane intentionally. They believe they're inclusive. But in situations where the language consistently causes discomfort to a team member, it's about creating an environment where everyone feels welcome. The argument that it's \"normal words\" might not hold weight if those words are contributing to a feeling of exclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, language can be tricky. People often use terms without considering their impact. The key here is that Jane has provided feedback, and the author is choosing not to adjust, which might be seen as not respecting her feelings. The other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" was sorry and tried to include her, but it backfired, showing that even attempts at inclusion can be problematic if the language isn't inclusive from the start.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention isn't malicious, the continued use of gendered terms in a mixed group where it's causing a team member to feel excluded likely places the responsibility on them to adjust their language for the sake of inclusivity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
