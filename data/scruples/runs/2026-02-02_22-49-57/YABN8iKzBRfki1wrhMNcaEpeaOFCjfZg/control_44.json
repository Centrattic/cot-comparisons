Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"lads\" or \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, feels excluded.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jane has already expressed discomfort with terms like \"boiz\" and suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even more exclusionary. The author then defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusive language and respect for others' feelings. The author is using terms that Jane finds hurtful. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is negative. The other team member apologized and changed his language, but the author doubles down, which might be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author frames Jane as being \"overly sensitive,\" which can be a way of invalidating her experience. Inclusion isn't just about intent but also about how people perceive and feel. If Jane feels othered, then the word choice, regardless of intent, is problematic. \n\nThe author's stance against \"radical feminism\" might also indicate a lack of understanding or empathy towards issues Jane faces in a male-dominated environment. The fact that some others are taking her side suggests that the group is trying to be inclusive, and the author's resistance could be seen as opposing that effort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not considering Jane's perspective and is maintaining language that excludes her, even after she's asked for change. That would make the author in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
