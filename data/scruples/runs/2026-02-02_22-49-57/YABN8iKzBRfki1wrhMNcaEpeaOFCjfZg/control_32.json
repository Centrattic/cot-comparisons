Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mixed-gender team where the group uses terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mostly male online game. When they invited Jane, a female player, she asked them to change the language to be more inclusive, like saying \"team\" instead. The author, however, continues to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they mean the whole team and they shouldn't have to change their language because someone is \"overly sensitive.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team was predominantly male, and Jane was the only girl. She feels excluded when they use gendered terms, even if it's intended to include everyone. The author mentions that other guys are taking her side, which is surprising to them. They also made a comment about not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which might indicate a misunderstanding of the issue.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the words they use can still make someone feel excluded. The term \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, so using them in a mixed group might inadvertently marginalize the female members. Jane's feedback is valid because she's experiencing discomfort, and the other members agreed to try using \"team\" instead. The author's refusal to adjust their language, despite the group's agreement and Jane's feelings, could be seen as dismissive of her experience.\n\nThe comment about \"radical feminism\" also comes off as a deflection. It's not about politics but about creating an inclusive environment. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to change their words for \"overly sensitive people\" might be the problem here. It's not about being overly sensitive but about respecting others' feelings and creating a welcoming space.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that their intention was inclusive and that the words don't mean to exclude. However, intent vs. impact is a common debate. Even with good intentions, the impact matters. If someone is made to feel excluded, the language needs to adapt to be more inclusive.\n\nThe guy who initially said \"Have fun lads and Jane\" apologized and tried to include her, which shows some awareness. The author's refusal to adjust their language, especially after Jane's feedback and the group's agreement, might be seen as not respecting her and the others' efforts to be inclusive.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because they are not considering Jane's perspective and the group's attempt to be more inclusive. The language they use, even if intended to include everyone, can have the effect of excluding someone, and their response seems dismissive of her valid concerns.\n"
