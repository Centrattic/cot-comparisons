Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, feels excluded. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The team is almost entirely male, and Jane is the only girl. She's already pointed out that terms like \"boiz\" make her feel left out, so they agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then another guy slips up by saying \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane finds even worse. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nNow, considering Jane's feelings, she's in a minority as a woman in a male-dominated group. The terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male, so even if the intention is to include everyone, the effect might still be exclusionary. The author's stance of not changing their language despite Jane's discomfort could be seen as dismissive. \n\nAlso, the fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that maybe the author is not the only one who's wrong, but the question is about the author specifically. The author's comment about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as disrespectful to Jane's valid feelings. \n\nSo, even if the intention is inclusion, the impact matters. The author is choosing to stick with terms that Jane finds hurtful. That's probably where the wrong lies\u2014not in the words themselves, but in ignoring the teammate's feelings. The right approach would be to use more inclusive language as Jane suggested. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
