Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to use \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: they're an online team game that's 99% male. Jane, the only girl, joined the team. The group often uses terms like \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed to try. Then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. Others apologized and changed their ways, but the author is still using the terms and seems upset about people taking Jane's side.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that they're not in the wrong. They think Jane is being overly sensitive. But Jane is the only female in a very male-dominated group, and she's pointing out that the language used makes her feel othered. The key here is about inclusive language and how the majority can unintentionally exclude the minority.\n\nWhen you're in a group where most people are of one gender, using male-specific terms can make the minority feel excluded even if the intent is to include. The author argues that they mean the whole team, but the impact is what matters, not just the intent. Jane's experience is valid because the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, and adding her name separately, like in \"lads and Jane,\" actually highlights her difference. That's why she felt even more othered.\n\nThe author says they're not giving in to radical feminism, but this isn't about ideology; it's about making Jane feel included. The fact that other members apologized and changed their behavior shows that the group recognized the issue. The author's refusal to adjust their language, despite Jane's clear discomfort, might be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. Inclusive language is about making everyone feel part of the group without feeling singled out or excluded. So, the author's insistence on using terms that Jane finds exclusionary could be considered wrong because it disregards her experience and the group's agreement to try using more inclusive terms.\n"
