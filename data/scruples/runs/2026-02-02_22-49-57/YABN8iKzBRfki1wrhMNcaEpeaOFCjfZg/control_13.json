Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group. The main points are that Jane, a female team member, feels excluded when these terms are used, even though the group treats her well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They argue that they mean the whole team when they say 'lads' or 'guys' and don't want to change their language just because someone is offended. They mention not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which might indicate some defensiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, Jane has explicitly stated that these terms make her feel excluded. She's part of a minority in a male-dominated environment, and even if the intent is inclusive, the impact is what matters. The other team member who said \"lads and Jane\" tried to include her individually, but that might have made her feel singled out or not part of the group. \n\nThe key here is understanding that language can have different effects than intended. Even if the author doesn't see a problem, the fact that Jane feels othered is significant. The group agreed to use more inclusive terms after Jane's initial feedback, but the author is resisting, which could be seen as not valuing Jane's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about not wanting to accommodate \"overly sensitive people\" might come across as dismissive. In collaborative settings, especially teams, being inclusive is important for everyone's comfort and performance. The author's stance could be harming team cohesion, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, their refusal to adjust their language despite clear feedback from Jane could be considered inconsiderate. It's about balancing personal expression with the team's needs and ensuring all members feel included. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
