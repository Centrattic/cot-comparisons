Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking whether they're in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, feels excluded. \n\nSo, first, the team is mostly male, and they added Jane. She asked them to stop using \"boiz\" because it made her feel left out. They agreed to try \"team\" instead. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found even worse because it highlighted her difference. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. Others apologized and changed their language, but the author is upset that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Jane made it clear that these terms make her feel excluded. The author might not see the issue, thinking they're using the words to refer to the whole team. But from Jane's perspective, being singled out by adding her name or using gendered terms can make her feel like she doesn't belong. The author is dismissing her feelings as being overly sensitive and bringing up \"radical feminism,\" which might be invalidating her experience.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether respecting someone's feelings is necessary. Even if the intention is inclusive, the impact matters. If Jane feels othered, then the terms are problematic for her. The author's refusal to adjust despite knowing her feelings could be seen as not being considerate. Also, the fact that others apologized and changed their language suggests that there's a valid concern. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to change their language for \"overly sensitive\" people might be the issue here. So, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not taking Jane's valid feelings into account and are being dismissive.\n"
