Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about a group of male players in an online game who invited a girl named Jane. They used terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads\" which Jane found exclusionary. The author of the question says they agreed to use \"team\" instead. But when one guy wrote \"Have fun lads and Jane\", Jane felt othered. The author then said they would keep using \"lads\" and \"guys\" and mentioned not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants another opinion. I need to decide if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to include the whole team, but using terms that Jane finds exclusionary. Even if the intent is inclusive, the impact matters here. Jane is part of the team and feels excluded. The key is whether using traditional male terms in a mixed group is problematic.\n\nThe author's response to Jane's feedback by doubling down and using a term like \"radical feminism\" might be dismissive. That could be seen as invalidating Jane's feelings. Even if the author believes they're being inclusive, the words chosen can make someone feel like an outsider. The other guy apologized and changed his behavior, showing awareness.\n\nSo, the author's stance might be seen as not considering Jane's perspective. Communication is about how others receive the message, not just the sender's intent. The author might be in the wrong for not adapting their language to include Jane, even if they mean the whole team. Therefore, answer A (yes, in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
