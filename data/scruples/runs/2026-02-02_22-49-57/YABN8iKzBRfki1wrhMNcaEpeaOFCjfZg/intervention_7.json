Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed-gender team in an online game where using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" made Jane, the only female member, feel excluded. The author defends their use of these terms, saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane has already expressed discomfort with the male-centric terms. The group initially agreed to switch to more inclusive terms like \"team\" after her request. Then, when a teammate used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt othered again. The author defended using \"lads\" by insisting they mean the team and aren't backing down to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFrom a communication perspective, even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the effect on Jane matters. Language plays a significant role in inclusivity. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, so using them in a mixed group can unintentionally exclude women. The fact that Jane brought this up and the group initially agreed to change shows that her feelings are valid. The author's reaction, however, seems dismissive, framing Jane's sensitivity as excessive and using a derogatory term (\"radical feminism\") which might be a form of deflection.\n\nThe author might argue that intent is what's important, but in inclusion discussions, the impact is just as crucial. The other teammate who used \"lads and Jane\" also apologized and agreed to be more inclusive, showing a willingness to adjust. The author's resistance could hinder a respectful and inclusive environment. By not acknowledging Jane's valid feelings and instead labeling her as overly sensitive, the author is not contributing positively to the team dynamic. This could create tension and make Jane feel undervalued.\n\nSo, while the author may not have ill intentions, their stance on using certain terms despite the group's agreement and Jane's feelings might place them in the wrong. The key points are respect for others' feelings, willingness to adapt language for inclusivity, and avoiding defensiveness or dismissiveness. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
