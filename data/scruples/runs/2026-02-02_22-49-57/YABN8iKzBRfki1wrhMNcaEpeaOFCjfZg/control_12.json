Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed group where they play an online team game. The team is mostly male, and they added a female player named Jane. The main issue is about the use of words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in group chat.\n\nSo, Jane told them that using \"boiz\" or \"lads\" made her feel excluded. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try. Then one guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The author of the post defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nHmm. The key here is about inclusive language and whether the author is wrong for continuing to use terms that Jane finds exclusionary. The author argues that they're not being exclusionary, but Jane clearly feels othered. The other guy apologized and tried to change, but the author is standing their ground. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider the feelings of all team members. Even if the author doesn't intend to exclude Jane, the impact of their words matters. The fact that Jane is part of the team and that the group initially agreed to use \"team\" shows that they wanted to be inclusive. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" and their use of the term \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive or even sexist.\n\nAlso, the other team members are taking Jane's side, which suggests that the author might not be considering the group's consensus. Even if the author thinks they're not excluding anyone, the reality is that Jane is feeling excluded. The principle here is about respecting others' feelings and adapting communication to be inclusive, even if it's not personally offensive. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong by not respecting Jane's feedback and standing by terms that make her uncomfortable. They should be more considerate of inclusive language to ensure everyone feels part of the team. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
