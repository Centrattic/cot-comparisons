Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is part of an online team game that's mostly male. They invited a girl named Jane. After matches, they used terms like \"well done boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed, but then another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it made her feel othered. The author defended the use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. The other guy apologized, but the author is frustrated that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to change because someone is sensitive. But Jane has a different perspective. She feels excluded when terms like \"lads\" are used, even if the intention isn't exclusionary. The key here is whether the author is wrong for using those terms. \n\nI know that inclusive language is important in mixed groups. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" can be seen as male-centric, which might make a woman feel she doesn't fully belong. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is real. The author's response of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might be dismissive of Jane's feelings. It's about empathy and considering others' perspectives. The author's stance might be seen as not acknowledging Jane's experience, even if others in the group are trying to adjust. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
