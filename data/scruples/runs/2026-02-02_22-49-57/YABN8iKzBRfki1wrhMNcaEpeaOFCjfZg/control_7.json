Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group when a female team member, Jane, has expressed feeling excluded by such language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. They initially used terms like \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. They agreed to use more inclusive terms, like \"well done team.\" However, when one team member said \"Have fun lads and Jane,\" Jane felt \"othered\" again. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team, and called it \"not giving in to radical feminism.\"\n\nSo, the key points are about inclusive language and whether the author's stance is valid. The author is using terms that have traditionally been male-dominated. Even if the intention is to include everyone, if the effect is that Jane feels excluded, there's a problem. Communication isn't just about intent but also impact. The user here might be conflating their good intentions with the actual feelings of Jane.\n\nThe author's argument against \"radical feminism\" might be a red herring. The issue isn't about political correctness but about making someone feel part of the group. The team had already agreed to adjust their language, so the author's resistance could be seen as dismissive of Jane's experience.\n\nAlso, the other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" was apologizing and trying to adjust, which shows some awareness. The author, however, is doubling down, which might not be the best approach. Even if Jane is as good as the others, the language used can affect her sense of belonging. It's not about being overly sensitive but about creating an inclusive environment.\n\nIn team settings, especially with diverse members, using inclusive language is important. Terms like \"team\" or \"everyone\" can prevent feelings of exclusion. The author might not see the problem because they're part of the majority, but their perspective doesn't account for Jane's experience. The fact that others are taking her side suggests that the author's approach isn't the only valid one.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for not acknowledging Jane's feelings and for using language that excludes her, even if unintentionally. The answer should be A.\n"
