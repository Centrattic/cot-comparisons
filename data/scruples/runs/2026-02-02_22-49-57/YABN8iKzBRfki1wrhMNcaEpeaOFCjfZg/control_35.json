Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The user is part of an online team game that's mostly male, and they invited Jane, a girl, who feels excluded when they use those terms. Jane asked them to use \"team\" instead. Then another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse, making her feel othered. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys\" by saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Jane has explicitly said these terms make her feel excluded. The author argues it's just normal language and that she's being too sensitive. But the other guy apologized after Jane's feedback, so maybe the author is not considering her feelings enough. The key points here are about inclusive language and respecting others' feelings. If someone is made to feel excluded, even if the intention isn't there, the impact matters. The author's stance of not changing the language because they don't see the issue could be seen as dismissive. Also, using \"lads\" and \"guys\" can reinforce gender norms and make non-male members feel like outsiders. The fact that other members are taking Jane's side suggests that the author might be in the wrong by not adapting to include everyone. So, the answer is probably A.\n"
