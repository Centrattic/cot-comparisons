Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The user plays in an online team game where almost all players are male. They recently added a girl named Jane. Jane felt excluded when the group used terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads,\" so she suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed, and the author even mentioned that Jane is just as good as the guys. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane\" in a chat, and Jane criticized that as making her feel \"othered.\" The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized and said he'll try to use \"team\" or \"people\" in the future. The author is surprised that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Jane is the only female in a predominantly male group. The use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" is traditional male-oriented terms. Even though the author and others might use them inclusively, Jane's experience is that they don't feel inclusive. The term \"othered\" is key here. It means she feels like an outsider. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive\" and blaming \"radical feminism,\" which could be a sign of not taking her perspective seriously.\n\nI remember that inclusive language is about considering how words affect others, especially in mixed groups. Even if the intention isn't to exclude, the impact matters. The other guy's message was meant to include Jane by name, but using \"lads\" and then her name might highlight her as different. The author, however, is doubling down on the original terms, which could be seen as not making an effort to be inclusive. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude of not wanting to \"give in to radical feminism\" might come across as dismissive of legitimate concerns about inclusivity. It's possible that the author is not recognizing the broader issue of gender inclusivity in spaces that are traditionally male-dominated. \n\nThe group had already agreed to use \"team\" instead, so the author's continued use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" might be going against the group's prior decision, which Jane had asked for. If the group is trying to adjust for Jane's comfort, the author's resistance could be seen as not respecting the team's consensus. \n\nBut wait, the author says they mean the whole team. Maybe they believe the terms are neutral. However, the reality is that these terms often exclude non-male individuals, and the fact that Jane has already mentioned the problem suggests that the terms are indeed problematic in this context. The author's insistence on using them despite feedback could be inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the other guy tried to include her by name but still used \"lads,\" which Jane found worse. That might show that even attempts to include can be counterproductive if the language is still isolating. The author's refusal to adapt their language might reinforce the exclusion. \n\nSo, the main points are: Jane's valid feelings of being excluded, the group's agreement to use more inclusive terms, the author's dismissive attitude towards Jane's concerns, and the potential harm of not respecting her experience. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the impact of their words is what's at issue here. In AITA (Am I the A**hole) contexts, the answer often hinges on whether the person's actions, even if unintended, caused harm and their willingness to acknowledge and adjust for that. The author is not acknowledging the potential harm and is instead defending their usage, which is a red flag. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
