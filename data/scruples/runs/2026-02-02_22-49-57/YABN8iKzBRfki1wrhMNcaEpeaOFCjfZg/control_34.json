Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, has expressed discomfort. The author defends using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Others in the group apologized and agreed to use more inclusive terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language on inclusivity. Jane has already mentioned that \"lads\" makes her feel excluded. When the group agreed to use \"team\" instead, they were trying to be inclusive. The author then continued using \"lads\" despite Jane's feedback and framed it as a matter of principle against \"radical feminism.\" That seems dismissive of her feelings.\n\nEven if the author didn't intend to exclude Jane, the words they use have consequences. Language that's historically male-dominated can make others feel like outsiders, even if the speaker's intention is to include everyone. The fact that the other guy apologized and changed his behavior shows he recognized the issue. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as not valuing Jane's inclusion in the team. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" could come off as invalidating Jane's experience. It's possible that the author is more focused on preserving their own language habits than creating a welcoming environment. The team is supposed to be inclusive, so using terms that exclude a member might hinder that. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was neutral, the effect on Jane is negative. The responsibility is on the speaker to adjust their language if it's causing discomfort. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not making that effort.\n"
