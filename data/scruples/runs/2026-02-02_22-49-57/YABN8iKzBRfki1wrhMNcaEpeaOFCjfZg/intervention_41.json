Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is the use of terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed-gender group. Jane, the female teammate, feels excluded when these terms are used, so she suggests using \"team\" instead. The author defends using those terms, saying it's not their fault and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is 99% male, so Jane is a minority. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. Even if the author intends to include everyone, the words themselves might not align with that intent. Jane's feedback is that these terms make her feel excluded. The author acknowledges that Jane is part of the team and good at the game, but still resists changing the language. \n\nThe other teammate who used \"lads and Jane\" was apologized for, but the author is doubling down. The key point here is about respect and considering others' feelings. Even if the author doesn't see the problem, Jane does, and she's the one whose feelings are being affected. The author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" might come across as dismissive and not taking Jane's feelings seriously. \n\nUsing language that includes everyone is a common way to foster inclusivity. The author's stance could be seen as refusing to make a small change that makes Jane feel included, which is a valid concern. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that there's a collective understanding that inclusivity is important. \n\nSo, even though the author might not be intentionally excluding Jane, their refusal to adjust based on her feedback could be seen as not respecting her experience. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering the impact of their words on Jane, despite her clear discomfort.\n"
