Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that Jane, a female team member, has expressed discomfort with these terms. The author defends their use by saying they mean the whole team and they don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of Jane. She's part of the team and felt excluded when these terms were used. The key point here is whether the language used in the group is inclusive. Even if the intention is to address the whole team, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric. When a female member is present, using these terms might unintentionally exclude her, even if that's not the intention.\n\nThen there's the author's response. They claim they're using normal words and that others are being overly sensitive. This attitude can be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings. It's important to recognize that communication is about how it's received, not just the intent. If Jane feels othered, the author's continued use of the terms, despite prior agreement to try alternatives, could be seen as not respecting her feelings.\n\nAlso, the other guy who said sorry and agreed to change shows that there's a willingness to adjust among some team members. The author's stance against changing the language despite the team's effort to be inclusive might be problematic. The phrase \"not giving in to radical feminism\" is a bit of a red flag, as it could be seen as invalidating Jane's legitimate concerns and using a divisive term.\n\nSo, even though the author means well, their unwillingness to adapt their language to include Jane and their dismissal of her feelings likely put them in the wrong. The core issue is about inclusion and respect, not just about the words themselves.\n"
