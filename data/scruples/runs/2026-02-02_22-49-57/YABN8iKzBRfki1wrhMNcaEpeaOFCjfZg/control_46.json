Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed-gender team where the majority are male players. Jane, the female teammate, felt excluded when they used terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" and suggested using \"team\" instead. The author defends using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized and agreed to use \"team\" in the future, but the author is upset that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane is a minority in a male-dominated group. Using gendered terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" can inadvertently exclude women, even if that's not the intent. The author argues that they mean the whole team, but the impact on Jane is that she feels othered. The key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the intention is inclusive, the reality is that these terms can make someone feel excluded. \n\nThe other guy made an effort to include Jane by adding her name, but it still came off as excluding her by using \"lads.\" Jane's reaction is valid because she's pointing out that such language doesn't fully include her. The author's response that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings. \n\nThe author is resisting changing their language despite the team agreeing to try using \"team.\" By continuing to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" they might be undermining the team's agreement to be inclusive. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's stance is not widely supported here. \n\nIn communication, it's important to consider how others perceive your words. Even if the author means to include everyone, the words they choose have a history and cultural context that can alienate. The group's effort to adjust their language shows a willingness to be inclusive, which is a positive step. The author's refusal might be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings and the team's collective decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the right because they're not acknowledging Jane's valid experience and are being dismissive despite the team's efforts to include her. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
