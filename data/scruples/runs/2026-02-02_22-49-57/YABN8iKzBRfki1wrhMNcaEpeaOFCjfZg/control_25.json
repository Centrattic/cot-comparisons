Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed-gender group, which a female team member, Jane, finds exclusionary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author argues that they're using terms they've always used and don't see an issue, even suggesting they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" They feel Jane is being overly sensitive. On the other hand, Jane has clearly expressed that these terms make her feel excluded. The group initially agreed to use more inclusive language like \"team,\" but the author is pushing back against that.\n\nThe key points here are about intent vs. impact. The author's intent might be to include everyone by using \"lads\" or \"guys,\" but the impact on Jane is negative. Even if the author doesn't see a problem, the fact that Jane feels othered is significant. Inclusion and respect for others' feelings are important in group dynamics. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as \"radical feminism\" could be seen as invalidating her experience, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the group had already agreed to try more inclusive language. By the author continuing to use the terms they previously agreed to avoid, they might be undermining the group's effort to be inclusive. The other guy who made the comment apologized and tried to adjust, showing awareness. The author's refusal to adjust might come off as resistant to change, even if the intent was good.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a growing emphasis on inclusive language. While \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, using them in mixed groups can be seen as exclusionary. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to change their language for \"overly sensitive\" people might not consider that language can affect group cohesion and individual comfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions disregard Jane's feelings and the group's previous agreement to use inclusive terms. The author's refusal to adapt shows a lack of empathy and could harm the team's unity.\n"
