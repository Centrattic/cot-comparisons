Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The main points are that the team is mostly male, Jane joined and felt excluded when they used those terms. They agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then one guy used \"lads and Jane\" which she found worse. The author says they'll keep using the terms because they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Others apologized and said they'd try to include her more.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key here is about inclusive language. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often used in male-dominated groups and can make women feel excluded. Jane has already pointed out that these terms make her feel not part of the team. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is negative. The author's response of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings.\n\nAlso, when the other guy tried to include Jane by adding her name, she found that othering. That suggests that even attempts to be inclusive can backfire if not done thoughtfully. The author's stance of continuing to use those terms despite Jane's feedback might be seen as not respecting her feelings and the team's agreed-upon change.\n\nIn discussions about language and inclusivity, it's often about the impact, not just intent. The author is part of a team where someone has expressed discomfort, and the team had agreed to adjust their language. By refusing to comply, the author is not supporting the team's effort to be inclusive. This could create a hostile environment for Jane, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the author's refusal to change the language, despite clear feedback, shows a lack of consideration for Jane's experience. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
