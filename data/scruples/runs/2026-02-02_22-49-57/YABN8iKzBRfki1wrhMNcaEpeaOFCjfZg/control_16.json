Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of mostly male players in an online game who included a female teammate, Jane. The main issue is the use of terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in communication, which Jane finds exclusionary.\n\nFirst, the original poster (OP) says that Jane felt excluded when they used \"boiz\" and suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try that, but then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse. The OP then defends their use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming they mean the whole team and are not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" They also mention that some other guys are taking Jane's side, which surprises them.\n\nI need to determine if the OP is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. Jane is part of the team, and the group is mostly male. The terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. Even though the OP intends to include everyone, the reality is that these terms can make someone who is part of a minority gender feel excluded. Jane's reaction is valid because she's pointing out that the language doesn't reflect the team's composition. The fact that the group initially agreed to use more inclusive terms but then reverted to old habits when someone mentioned Jane specifically might have exacerbated her feeling of being othered.\n\nThe OP's argument is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to change for \"overly sensitive\" people. However, inclusivity often requires adapting language to make all members feel part of the group. The term \"lads\" can be seen as excluding non-male members, regardless of intent. The key point is intent versus impact. Even if the intent was to include everyone, the impact on Jane was negative. The group's willingness to adjust initially shows awareness, but the OP's resistance and labeling it as \"radical feminism\" suggests a lack of empathy.\n\nThe other member who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and committed to change, which the OP might see as a sign of the other members being on Jane's side. However, the OP's own refusal to adjust their language is the crux here. The argument that they're not \"giving in to radicalism\" dismisses Jane's valid feelings and the importance of inclusive language in fostering a welcoming environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the OP's intention was to include everyone, their continued use of exclusionary terms despite Jane's feedback and the group's prior agreement to use inclusive language puts them in the wrong. The issue isn't about being overly sensitive but about creating an inclusive space where all members feel valued.\n"
