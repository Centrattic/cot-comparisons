Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation involves Jane, a female team member who feels excluded by these terms, and the author defending their language as \"normal\" and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They believe that using \"lads\" or \"guys\" isn't an issue because they're referring to the whole team. They might see it as harmless and part of their existing team culture. The author is also frustrated that others are taking Jane's side, implying they feel misunderstood or unfairly criticized.\n\nOn the other hand, Jane's experience is important. She has explicitly stated that these terms make her feel excluded. The term \"lads\" has a history of being used in male-dominated contexts, often in ways that can be dismissive or exclusionary towards women. Even if the intent is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is real and valid. The fact that the group had already agreed to use more inclusive language like \"team\" after her initial feedback shows that she's made her discomfort clear.\n\nThe incident with the other guy saying \"lads and Jane\" was a direct attempt to include her, but Jane found it even worse. This suggests that adding her name might have highlighted the exclusion rather than solving it. The author's response, however, is to double down and accuse Jane of being overly sensitive and bringing up radical feminism, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nIn communication and inclusivity discussions, the principle is often that intent doesn't matter as much as impact. Even if the author didn't mean to exclude Jane, the words they're using do have that effect. The team had already made a conscious effort to adjust their language after Jane's first feedback, so the author's refusal to adapt could undermine that effort and make Jane feel that her concerns aren't taken seriously.\n\nAdditionally, the author's use of the term \"radical feminism\" might be a mischaracterization. Jane's request isn't about ideology but about feeling included. The author's framing of the issue as a political stance could be dismissive of her personal experience.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, do contribute to Jane's feeling of exclusion. The decision to continue using language that has been identified as problematic by a team member, despite prior agreement to change, could be seen as not respecting her boundaries and the team's collective agreement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their language choice negatively affects a team member, even if unintentionally.\n"
