It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The scenario is a political disagreement that escalated into yelling, mockery, and then the author hitting her husband with a closed fist. The husband then left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there was prior yelling and mockery, hitting someone is a form of physical aggression. The user's own edit acknowledges that she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which suggests she's aware of the mistake. But the initial question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, using physical force against a partner is considered abusive regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, the response of hitting is still not acceptable. The fact that the husband left and she hasn't seen him since might indicate that he's upset, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that the situation was provoked. But in terms of right and wrong, violence is generally not justified, even in heated arguments. There's also the edit about a troll account, but that's probably a red herring and not relevant to the initial question.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the husband was being a jerk, the author's response of hitting him is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
