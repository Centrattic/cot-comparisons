It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left and she hasn't seen him since. The author is questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here: domestic violence, mutual accountability, and the use of physical force in an argument. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, which is inconsiderate and possibly disrespectful, hitting someone\u2014even in anger\u2014is a form of physical abuse. In most societal and legal standards, using physical violence in a relationship is unacceptable, regardless of the provocation. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face, which resulted in a bruise, indicates that it was a harmful action.\n\nThe author's edit shows she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a positive step. However, the initial action of hitting is still a problem. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is not excusable either, but that doesn't justify the use of physical violence. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she admitted she was wrong in her edit, but the original question is whether she is in the wrong based on the situation as presented before the edits.\n\nIn such cases, even if both parties have faults, the use of physical violence typically places the person who used it in the wrong. The husband's yelling and mockery might be inconsiderate, but it's not a justification for hitting. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she physically assaulted her husband, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
