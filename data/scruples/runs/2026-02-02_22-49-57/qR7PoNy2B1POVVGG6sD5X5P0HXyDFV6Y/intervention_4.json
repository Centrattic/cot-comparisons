It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife about abortion. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, so she hit him with a closed fist. He left, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and drove off. The author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a heavy issue. Even if there was provocation, using physical force can be seen as wrong. The woman admits she was in a fit of rage, which might indicate she acted impulsively. However, the husband was also yelling and mocking, which could contribute to the tension. But the key point is that she used a closed fist hit to the face, which is a clear act of physical aggression.\n\nThen, the author's own edit says she realizes what she did was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the question is about whether she was in the wrong. In most societal standards, hitting someone, even in anger, is not acceptable. The fact that the husband was yelling and mocking might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't justify physical violence. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is also problematic, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband complicates things, but the original scenario is still valid. The author's own admission in the edit that she's wrong indicates she knows it's not right. So, even if the husband was at fault in the argument, the act of hitting is a separate issue. It's possible that both acted inappropriately, but physically hitting another person is typically seen as wrong regardless of the situation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
