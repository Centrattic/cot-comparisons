It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her action was justified. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is generally considered wrong. Physical violence is not an acceptable response to conflict, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, that doesn't give her the right to physically assault him. \n\nThe user also mentions that this was the first time such a thing happened and that she's planning to apologize. While acknowledging the mistake and wanting to make amends is a positive step, the act itself still stands as the initial wrongdoing. \n\nThe husband's reaction, calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off, might indicate his own issues in handling the conflict, but it doesn't excuse her physical violence. The key point here is that using physical force in an argument typically crosses a line into domestic abuse, which is never acceptable. \n\nAlso, there's an edit about a troll account, but that doesn't change the original scenario. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a troll or joke, but irrelevant to the main issue. \n\nIn most ethical and legal frameworks, using physical violence against a partner is considered wrong. So the author is in the wrong here.\n"
