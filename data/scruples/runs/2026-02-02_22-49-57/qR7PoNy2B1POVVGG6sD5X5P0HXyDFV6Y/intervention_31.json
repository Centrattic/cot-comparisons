It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The scenario is that they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she punched him. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a red flag. Even if the other person was being aggressive or yelling, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. That's a legal issue, but the question here is about moral wrongdoing.\n\nThe husband started yelling and mocking her. That's disrespectful and could escalate tensions. However, responding with physical violence is not acceptable. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a step too far. It's important to note that mutual respect and communication are key in any relationship, and physical aggression breaks that trust.\n\nThe user mentioned that this was the first time and that she plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. However, the act itself is still wrong regardless of the circumstances. It's crucial to address why she felt the need to hit him. If there's a pattern of abuse or if she felt threatened, that's different, but the story doesn't mention that. It seems like a moment of anger during an argument.\n\nAlso, the husband left and called her a name, which is also disrespectful. But the question is about who's in the wrong. She initiated physical contact, which is a more severe action than verbal insults. So even if he was being a jerk, her action is the one that's legally and morally questionable.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people might justify hitting as a reaction to being disrespected, but it's not a justified reason. There are better ways to handle anger than violence. The fact that she's apologizing is good, but it doesn't negate the wrongness of the action.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if the husband was being an asshole, the woman hitting him makes her the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
