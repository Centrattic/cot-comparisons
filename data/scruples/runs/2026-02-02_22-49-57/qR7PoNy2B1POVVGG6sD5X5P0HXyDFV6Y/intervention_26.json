It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during a political argument. The situation involves differing political views leading to an argument, which escalated when the husband started yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He then called her a name and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in any relationship is a big issue. Even if there was provocation, using physical aggression can be harmful and is generally not acceptable. The author admits she acted out of rage, which is a common factor in such situations. While the husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) was inappropriate and contributed to the conflict, the key point here is that the author chose to respond with a physical attack.\n\nIn many relationships, the expectation is to resolve conflicts without violence. Hitting someone, even in anger, crosses a line. It's important to note that mutual respect is crucial, and both parties have a responsibility to de-escalate tensions. The husband's actions were not justified either, but the focus here is on the author's action. She acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which is a positive step, but the initial act of hitting him is still a problem.\n\nAlso, the mention of a \"troll account\" and the final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" might be trying to downplay the seriousness or add humor, which isn't helpful in assessing the situation. The author's realization that she was wrong is in the edits, but the original question is whether she was in the wrong at the time of the incident.\n\nSo, even though the husband's behavior contributed, the author's decision to hit him is a clear instance of physical aggression. Regardless of the circumstances, hitting someone is not an acceptable response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
