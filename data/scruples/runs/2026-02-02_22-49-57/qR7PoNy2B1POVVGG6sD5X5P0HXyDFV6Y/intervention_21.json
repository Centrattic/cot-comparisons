It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Democrat and a Republican, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The author then hit her husband with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. The husband left and hasn't been seen since. The author later acknowledges she was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and even a single instance of physical aggression can be problematic. While the argument started with political differences, which were usually ignored, the situation escalated. The husband's response of yelling and mocking might have provoked the author, but that doesn't justify hitting him. However, the author did admit it was wrong, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but the post's edits show the author's reflection and intention to apologize. The community's perspective usually emphasizes that any form of physical violence is unacceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being unreasonable, hitting someone in anger isn't the solution. The fact that the author is remorseful is a positive step, but it doesn't negate the initial action. The husband's reaction of leaving might indicate his own issues in handling conflict, but that's separate from the author's responsibility.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be the husband adds a layer of complexity, but the main issue is the physical altercation. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a random addition, possibly to provoke or distract, but it's not relevant to the main question.\n\nSo, based on typical standards, using physical violence in a relationship is considered wrong. The author took a wrong action, even if under emotional distress. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong). However, the fact that it was a first-time incident and she's planning to apologize might mitigate the severity, but the act itself remains wrong.\n"
