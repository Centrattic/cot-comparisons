It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which led her to punch him. The key points here are the context of the argument, the escalation to physical violence, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with differing views. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it got big. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which is emotional abuse or at least disrespectful. In response, she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since.\n\nNow, the user's question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants others' opinions. \n\nIn many places, the law considers mutual combat in a domestic setting. If both parties are engaging in violence, it can be a gray area. However, the key here is that the husband started by yelling and mocking, which might be seen as provocation. The wife's response was a punch, which caused a bruise. Even if he escalated things by leaving and calling her a name, the fact that she initiated physical violence is problematic.\n\nAlso, in legal terms, using force in self-defense typically requires that the force be reasonable and proportional. Here, the husband wasn't using physical force initially, just verbal abuse. Hitting him might not qualify as self-defense because there was no immediate physical threat. So, she could be liable for assault.\n\nMoreover, in terms of social norms, even if provoked, hitting a spouse is generally frowned upon. While the husband's behavior was inexcusable, the wife's response crosses a line into physical violence. The fact that she later realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize is a mitigating factor, but the act itself is still a problem.\n\nThe troll account edit and the last edit about gamers might be distractions, but the main issue is the violence. Even if it's the first time, physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. So, while the husband's behavior contributed, the author did commit an act of violence. Therefore, she is at least partially at fault, and likely in the wrong.\n"
