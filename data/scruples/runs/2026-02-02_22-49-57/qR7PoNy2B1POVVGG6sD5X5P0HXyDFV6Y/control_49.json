It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who hit their husband is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which led to yelling and mocking. The author hit their husband with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then the husband left, and the author hasn't seen him since. The user is asking if they're the asshole for punching him or if the husband is being a baby.\n\nLooking at the details, the key points are the act of hitting someone in an argument, even if provoked. In most places, using physical violence in a conflict, regardless of the reason, is generally considered wrong. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him escalated the situation. The author later admits they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize, which shows they know it's not acceptable. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction of calling the author a name and driving off might be part of the cycle of conflict, but that doesn't justify the punch. However, mutual escalation doesn't make either side right. In terms of responsibility, the physical act of hitting is a clear instance of violence, which is typically frowned upon in relationships and the law. Even in heated arguments, physical harm is not an appropriate response. The author acknowledges their mistake, which is a positive step, but the initial action was wrong.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account, but that's probably unrelated to the main issue. The main question is about the author's actions. So, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for using physical violence.\n"
