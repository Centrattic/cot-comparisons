It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they got into a political argument with their husband, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Now he's gone, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing their differences, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking, which could be seen as aggressive behavior. She responded by hitting him, resulting in a bruise. Then he left, calling her a name. She later realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a general standpoint, using physical violence, even in a heated argument, is usually considered wrong. It's important to note that she used a closed fist to hit his face, which can cause injury. Even if he was being rude, hitting someone is not an appropriate response. There are better ways to handle conflicts without resorting to violence.\n\nHowever, context matters. He was yelling and mocking her, which might have provoked her. But regardless of the provocation, physical aggression is not justified. The law typically sees assault as a criminal act, and self-defense arguments might not hold if it's mutual combat. Also, she later admits she was wrong, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nThe edits mention a troll account and a final edit that's a random phrase, which might be trying to downplay the seriousness or add humor, but that doesn't change the initial action. The key issue is the use of physical violence. So, in terms of moral responsibility, she did something wrong. She should have de-escalated the situation instead of escalating it physically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for hitting her husband, even if there was provocation. Physical violence is not an acceptable response in an argument.\n"
