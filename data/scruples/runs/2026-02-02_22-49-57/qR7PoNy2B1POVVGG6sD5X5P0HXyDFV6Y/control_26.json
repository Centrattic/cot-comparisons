It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He left and came back with a bruise. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nPhysical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable. Even if the husband was being disrespectful by yelling and mocking, hitting him escalated the situation. The key point here is that using physical force to resolve an argument is wrong. Regardless of who started it, hitting someone is a violation and can be considered assault. \n\nThe author later says she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which is a good step. But the initial action of hitting is still problematic. The husband's behavior was also poor (yelling and mocking), but that doesn't justify a physical response. Both need to handle conflicts without violence. \n\nThe answer is A, because the author acted in the wrong by using physical violence."
