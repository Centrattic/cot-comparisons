It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument, yelling, mocking, and then a physical altercation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion, which is a sensitive topic. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which escalated the situation. The author hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left, and she hasn't seen him since. In the edits, she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether hitting someone is justified even in a heated argument. Generally, using physical violence in a relationship is considered wrong because it can escalate conflicts and cause harm. Even if provoked, the appropriate response is usually to de-escalate, not retaliate physically. The husband's yelling and mocking might be wrong, but that doesn't make the author's response acceptable. \n\nAlso, in many jurisdictions, there's a legal concept of self-defense, but that typically applies when there's an immediate threat of harm. Mocking or yelling might not constitute a threat that justifies a punch. The fact that the author admitted her mistake shows she recognizes the wrongdoing, which is a strong point towards her being in the wrong.\n\nMoreover, the edits mention she plans to apologize, which is a positive step, but the initial action is still problematic. The husband's reaction (calling her a name and leaving) might indicate his own faults, but that doesn't excuse her physical aggression. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the situation was tense and both parties have faults, the act of hitting someone is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
