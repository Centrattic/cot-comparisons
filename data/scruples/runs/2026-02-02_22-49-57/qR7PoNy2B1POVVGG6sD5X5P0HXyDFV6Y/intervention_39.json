It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement about abortion, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which escalated to a physical altercation. The woman hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in any relationship is generally a big deal. Even if there's a history of arguments, using physical force can be problematic. The key points here are that the husband was yelling and mocking her, which might have provoked her. But hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of domestic violence. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author admits she was in a rage and hit him. Even if the husband had it coming with his behavior, the act of hitting is still a problem. It's important to note that mutual respect and non-violence are crucial in relationships. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving adds to the tension, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nIn many cases, using physical violence can be considered wrong regardless of the provocation. While the husband's behavior was inconsiderate, the solution isn't to hit back. The author later admits she was wrong, which is a positive step. However, the initial act of hitting is still an issue. So, even if both parties are at fault in the argument, the physical act itself makes the author wrong in this scenario.\n"
