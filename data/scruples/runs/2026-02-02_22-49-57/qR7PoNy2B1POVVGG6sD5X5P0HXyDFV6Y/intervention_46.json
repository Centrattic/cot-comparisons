It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement, which escalated to yelling and mockery from the husband. The author then hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. The husband left in a car, and now the author is questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. While political disagreements are common, the fact that they usually ignore their differences suggests that this was a significant escalation. The husband's behavior of yelling and mocking could be a contributing factor. However, physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even in heated arguments, hitting someone can lead to further conflict and potential harm.\n\nThe author mentions that this was the first time something like this happened and that she plans to apologize. Admitting fault and taking responsibility is a positive step, indicating she recognizes her actions' impact. However, the act of hitting someone, even in anger, crosses a line. It's important to note that mutual respect and communication are key in relationships, and physical violence disrupts that.\n\nThe husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling conflict, but that doesn't justify the physical response. Both parties have a role in de-escalating situations, but using physical force is never the solution. The author's intent to make up shows she values the relationship, but the initial action of hitting is problematic.\n\nAlso, the edits mention a troll account and a humorous edit, which might be distractions, but the main issue remains. The key point is the physical altercation. In any case, using a closed fist to hit someone in an argument is a clear act of violence, and that's a strong indicator that the author is in the wrong, even if provoked.\n"
