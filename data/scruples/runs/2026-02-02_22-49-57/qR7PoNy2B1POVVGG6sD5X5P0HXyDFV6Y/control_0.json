It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, then she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left afterward, and she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, physically assaulting someone, even in a heated argument, is generally considered wrong. Even if there was provocation, using violence is not acceptable. The fact that it was a closed fist hit to the face is significant because that's more aggressive. The husband's reaction was to leave, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nIn relationships, resolving conflicts through violence can lead to more harm. There's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. The fact that she later realized it was wrong and plans to apologize shows she understands that. But the act itself is still wrong, regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, note the edits where she clarifies she's not the one making up the story and admits her mistake. But the initial action of hitting is the key point here. Even if the husband was being insensitive, hitting is not an appropriate response. \n\nSo, while the husband's behavior was poor (yelling and mocking), the author's response crossed a line into physical violence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
