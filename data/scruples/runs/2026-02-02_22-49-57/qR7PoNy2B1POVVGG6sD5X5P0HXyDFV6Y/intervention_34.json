It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where the husband yelled and mocked her, and she responded with a punch. The key points here are the use of physical violence and the context.\n\nFirst, physical violence is a big issue in relationships. Even if the husband was acting out by yelling and mocking, hitting him crosses a line. The author admits in the edit that they realize they were wrong, which is a good step. But the question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nIn most cases, physical aggression is not acceptable, regardless of provocation. It can escalate conflicts and cause harm. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The author's action led to their husband leaving, which complicates things further.\n\nAlso, the edits show the author is planning to apologize, which is positive. However, the initial act of hitting someone is a clear violation of non-violence in a relationship. So even though the husband was at fault in the argument, the author's response is still wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
