It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The context is a political disagreement about abortion, leading to yelling and mockery, which escalated to her hitting him. She then apologized in an edit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of hitting someone, regardless of the reason. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and can lead to further harm. Even if provoked, using physical force is not acceptable. The husband's response was also inappropriate\u2014he called her a \"bitch,\" which is a disrespectful insult. However, that doesn't justify the hitting. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I should evaluate based on principles. While arguments are common, resorting to violence is a step too far. The edit where she acknowledges her mistake is important; it shows she realizes it was wrong. But the initial action still stands. The husband's behavior was also poor, but that doesn't make her hitting him right. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of hitting, addressing the issue calmly would be better. So, even if the husband was being a jerk, hitting him is not the solution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using physical violence. \n\nAlso, the edit where she says she'll apologize is good, but the fact that she hit him first makes her responsible. The answer should be A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
