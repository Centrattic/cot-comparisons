It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The scenario involves political differences leading to an argument where the husband starts yelling and mocking her, and she responds with a punch. Then he leaves, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of hitting someone. In general, using physical violence in an argument is a red flag. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting him escalates the situation and can lead to more harm. The woman admits it was a closed fist hit to the face, which is a significant action. \n\nThen there's the context of the argument. They usually ignore political differences, but this time it was a big argument. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which is disrespectful but not necessarily a justification for violence. People often react impulsively in anger, but that doesn't make it right.\n\nLooking at the edits, the author later realizes they were wrong and plan to apologize. That shows self-awareness, but the initial action is still the focus here. The question is about whether they were in the wrong, not if they'll make amends.\n\nAlso, there's an edit mentioning a troll account and a humorous edit at the end. Those might be distractions, but the main issue is the physical aggression. Even if the husband started the argument with yelling, hitting is not an acceptable response. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, using physical force against a partner is typically considered abusive, regardless of the provocation. So the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because hitting someone, even in anger, is not justified. The husband's behavior was poor, but the woman's reaction crosses into violence, which is a more serious issue.\n"
