It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an argument with her husband about politics, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage with a closed fist to the face. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical assault is generally wrong, even in the heat of an argument. Hitting someone, regardless of the reasons, is a form of domestic violence. The fact that they usually ignore their political differences but this argument was particularly heated might explain the escalation, but it doesn't justify the physical action.\n\nThe husband did yell and mock her, which is rude and could contribute to her anger. However, that doesn't make hitting a justified response. The woman acknowledges she was wrong in her edit and says she'll apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the action itself is still problematic.\n\nAlso, the husband driving off and calling her a \"bitch\" after the incident is his own negative behavior. But the key point here is whether the woman was in the wrong for hitting him. Since physical violence isn't acceptable, even in response to verbal abuse, the answer here is likely A, that she is in the wrong. \n\nMoreover, the user is asking from an ethical standpoint, not just legal. While the husband's yelling is bad, the woman's action crosses a line into physical aggression, which is a more serious issue. So the answer should be A.\n"
