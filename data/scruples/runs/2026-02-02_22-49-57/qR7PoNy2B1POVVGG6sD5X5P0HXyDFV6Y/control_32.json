It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he's Republican and she's Democrat. The argument escalated, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He left after getting a small bruise, and she's now wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a physical response that could be considered wrong. The fact that she mentions it was the first time and she's planning to apologize shows she recognizes it was wrong, as seen in her edit. \n\nBut let's think deeper. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) might have contributed to the escalation. However, using physical violence is not an appropriate way to resolve disputes. Even in heated arguments, hitting someone crosses a line. There's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. Both parties could be at fault if the argument started because of not respecting each other's political views. But the key point here is that physical aggression is a clear wrong action, especially since it caused a bruise. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would typically be yes because physical violence is not acceptable. Even if the other person acted inappropriately, it doesn't justify hitting them. The fact that she is now acknowledging her mistake (in her edit) supports that she should take responsibility. \n\nAlso, there's the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband, which she clarifies isn't her. That might be a red herring but doesn't affect the main issue here. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a joke or a meme, not relevant to the core question.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence, even in an argument, is not acceptable and should not be justified regardless of the circumstances.\n"
