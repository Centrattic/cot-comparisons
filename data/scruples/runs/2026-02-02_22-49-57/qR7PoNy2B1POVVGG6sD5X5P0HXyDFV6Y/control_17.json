It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she and her husband had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him in a fit of rage. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is pretty aggressive behavior in an argument. The author hit him with a closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Then he called her a name and left. \n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, physical violence is generally considered wrong, even in the heat of an argument. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone can lead to injury, and it's a form of assault. The author acknowledges her mistake in an edit and says she'll apologize, which is a good step. However, the act itself is illegal in many places and considered a serious offense regardless of the provocation. \n\nHer husband's actions were also inappropriate\u2014yelling and mocking, then calling her a name. But that doesn't justify her response. While both acted poorly, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she used physical violence, which is against the law and a clear escalation, the answer is likely A (she's in the wrong). \n\nThe edit where she takes responsibility is important. She realizes she was wrong, so maybe there's growth there. But the initial act still makes her at fault. Even if the husband was being an asshole, hitting him isn't acceptable. So the answer should be A.\n"
