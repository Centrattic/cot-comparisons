It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation described. The couple has political differences, which they usually ignore. This time, the argument escalated because the husband started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's questioning if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the facts: physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him was a physical assault. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face and caused a bruise adds to the severity. The woman later realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her mistake. However, the initial act of hitting someone, even in anger, crosses a line. \n\nThe husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify her actions. Both sides might have handled the argument poorly, but physical violence is a clear wrongdoing. The edits she made later, especially the last one with inappropriate language, might be a red flag or a mistake, but the main issue is the punch.\n\nSo, even though there's context of an argument and mutual frustration, the act of hitting is a clear violation. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
