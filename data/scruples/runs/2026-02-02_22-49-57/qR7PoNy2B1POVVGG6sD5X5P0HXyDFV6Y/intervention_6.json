It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument, which they usually avoid. The husband started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, resulting in a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's wondering if she's the asshole here or if he's overreacting.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is to determine if she is. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) and B (no, not wrong). \n\nNow, considering general principles of right and wrong. Hitting someone, even in anger, is typically considered a physical assault, which is a form of violence. In most cultures and legal systems, using physical force in an argument is frowned upon, regardless of the provocation. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face and caused a bruise makes it clear that it was an act of aggression. \n\nThe husband's behavior was also aggressive (yelling, mocking), but that doesn't justify her hitting him back. People are usually expected to resolve conflicts without resorting to physical violence. Even if someone feels provoked, the response should be non-violent. The author acknowledges in the edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she understands that her action was wrong. \n\nThe other edit mentions a troll account, which might be a distraction, but the core issue is the physical altercation. The final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like a joke or an attempt to add humor, but it doesn't change the original action. \n\nSo, while the husband's yelling and mocking were clearly wrong and probably escalated the situation, the author's response was still a physical attack. Therefore, she is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
