It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political disagreements, escalating to yelling and mockery from the husband, then the wife hits him. He leaves and she can't find him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if physical violence is justified in this context. The key points are that the argument started over politics, which they usually avoid. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which might have provoked her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He responded by leaving and calling her a name.\n\nIn many situations, using physical force in an argument, even if provoked, is generally considered wrong because it escalates the conflict and can cause harm. The husband's yelling and mockery might be inappropriate too, but the wife's response involved physical violence, which is a bigger issue. Also, the edits show she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a positive step, but the initial action still needs to be judged.\n\nLegal perspectives might vary, but ethically, hitting someone even in anger is usually not acceptable. The husband's behavior was not great either, but the question is about the wife's actions. So the answer is likely yes, the author is in the wrong. The choice here is between A and B. A is correct.\n"
