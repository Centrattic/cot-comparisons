It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a political argument between them and their husband. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking the author, and in a fit of rage, the author hit him with a closed fist to the face. The husband left and there's a bruise. The author is asking if they're the asshole for punching him or if he's being a baby. \n\nFirst off, physical violence is a big issue. Even if the husband was being an ass, hitting someone is not acceptable. The author acknowledges that in the edit where they say they realize what they did was wrong. But the initial question is whether they're in the wrong. In most cases, using physical force in a conflict, even if provoked, is considered a mistake. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) might have been the catalyst, but that doesn't justify a punch. \n\nThe author's edit 2 shows they recognize their mistake, which is a good sign, but the action itself is still a problem. The husband's response of calling the author a bitch and driving off could indicate his own wrongdoing, but that doesn't make the author's punch okay. \n\nThere's also the mention of a troll account, but that's probably a red herring. The main issue is the physical altercation. So, even if the husband was in the wrong first, the author's response crosses a line. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
