It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation started with a political disagreement about abortion, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband. The wife, in a rage, hit him with a closed fist, resulting in a bruise. He left afterward, and she hasn't seen him since. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is an act of physical aggression. The fact that it caused a bruise is significant because it's a form of assault. \n\nThe wife mentions she's going to apologize and that it was the first time. But the key point is that hitting someone, regardless of provocation, is a clear violation of a relationship's non-violence. It's not about who started the argument but about the action taken. Even if the husband was being an ass, using physical force crosses a line. \n\nAlso, the husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off doesn't justify her actions. While his behavior was rude and possibly contributed to the tension, it doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. \n\nThere's a common misconception that in a heated argument, any escalation is justified, but that's not the case. Relationships require mutual respect and non-violence. If someone feels the need to hit, that's a problem that needs addressing, regardless of the provocation. \n\nAnother angle: the user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but upon reflection, considering the physical injury and the nature of assault, it's clear that the author did something wrong. The edits where she acknowledges her mistake are important, but the act itself is still wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The physical violence is not justified, even if there was an argument. Both parties need to handle conflicts without physical aggression. The husband's behavior was poor, but that doesn't excuse the wife's actions. It's important to address the root issues in the relationship, but hitting is never acceptable.\n"
