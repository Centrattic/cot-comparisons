It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The key points here are the context of the argument, the escalation of the situation, and the physical action taken.\n\nFirst, the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, which is a sensitive topic. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him. The user might think that since he initiated the yelling, she's justified. But in terms of right and wrong, physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if he was being aggressive, hitting him is a criminal act and can be considered assault. \n\nThe author later apologizes in an edit, which shows regret, but that doesn't negate the initial action. The husband also left, which might add to the situation's complexity, but that doesn't excuse the punch. The mention of a bruise and him calling her a name adds to the emotional charge, but again, physical violence is a step too far. \n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account and the inappropriate final edit might indicate the story isn't entirely reliable, but the main question is about the initial act. So, while the husband's behavior was poor, the author's response involved violence, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
