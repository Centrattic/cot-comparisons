It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

So, the situation is that they had an argument with their husband about politics, which escalated into yelling and mocking. The author then hit their husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband left, and now the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him was a violent response. The author acknowledges that it was wrong in their edit, so they might already realize this. The husband's reaction of calling them a name and leaving might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify the hit. The key point here is that using physical force to resolve an argument is a clear wrong, even if there was prior tension. The author should have addressed the conflict without violence. So, the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
