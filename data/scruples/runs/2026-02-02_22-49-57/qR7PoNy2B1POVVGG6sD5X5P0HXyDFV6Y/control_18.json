It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe user says they argue about politics, different parties, and this time it got heated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left afterward. She admits she was wrong and plans to apologize, and they might reconcile.\n\nNow, the key points here. In most legal systems, any physical violence in a relationship is a problem. Even if there's provocation, like yelling and mocking, using a closed fist to hit someone can be assault. The fact that there's a bruise suggests it wasn't just a slap but something more severe. So legally, she could be at fault here.\n\nBut also from a social standpoint, using physical violence is generally seen as wrong. Even if the husband was being abusive, the appropriate response isn't to hit back. There are ways to de-escalate or seek help. The user's action, while possibly a reaction to provocation, crosses a line into assault.\n\nAlso, she acknowledges her mistake in the edit, which is a good sign, but that doesn't erase the fact that she committed an act of violence. Both parties may have contributed to the argument, but hitting someone is a more severe action. The husband's yelling and mocking are bad, but they don't justify a punch.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if there was provocation, physical violence isn't acceptable. The response should be about addressing the issue without violence. Also, the fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since might indicate a pattern of conflict, but the immediate action of hitting him is the key issue here.\n"
