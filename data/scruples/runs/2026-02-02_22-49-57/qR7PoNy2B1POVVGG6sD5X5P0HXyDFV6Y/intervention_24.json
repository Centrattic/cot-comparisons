It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife. They usually ignore their differences, but this time it escalated with the husband yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then he left, calling her a name and driving off. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong but is now seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. She hit him first. Physical violence in a relationship is a big issue. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, using physical force crosses a line. The fact that there's a bruise indicates that the action was harmful. The user edited the post to acknowledge the mistake and plan to apologize, showing self-awareness. However, the initial act of hitting is a problem. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate (yelling, mocking), responding with physical violence can be considered a wrong action. Even if there's a valid reason, hitting someone is not acceptable. The user's edit shows they realize this, but the question is whether the initial act makes them the asshole.\n\nAlso, the mention of a \"troll account\" from the husband complicates things, but the core issue remains the physical altercation. The user's final edit is just a random line, maybe a typo or a mistake. So focusing on the main scenario: she hit him first. \n\nLegal and ethical standards generally condemn any form of physical abuse. Even if provoked, using violence is not justified. So the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The husband's actions were also wrong, but the question is about the author's responsibility. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
