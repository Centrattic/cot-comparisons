It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife, which escalated into yelling and mockery from him, leading her to punch him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this objectively. In many places, using physical violence in a relationship is considered wrong, regardless of the context. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, hitting him is a form of physical aggression. While the husband's behavior might have been part of the problem, physical retaliation can escalate the situation and cause harm. \n\nThe edits show that the author later realized her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows self-awareness. However, the initial action of hitting someone, even in anger, is typically seen as a mistake. The husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of dealing with the situation, but that doesn't excuse her actions. \n\nThere's also the mention of a troll account and the \"GAMERS RISE UP\" edit, which might be a red herring or an attempt to provoke a certain reaction, but the core issue remains the physical violence. \n\nSo, while the husband's behavior contributed to the argument, the author's decision to use physical violence is generally considered wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
