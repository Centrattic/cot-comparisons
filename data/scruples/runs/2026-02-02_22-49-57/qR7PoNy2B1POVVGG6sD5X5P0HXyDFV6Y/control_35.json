It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Now she's wondering if she was the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a criminal act. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face indicates intentional harm. The husband ran off and she hasn't seen him since, which might mean the situation escalated.\n\nShe later edited the post to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the initial action of hitting him is a problem. In most contexts, using physical violence in a relationship is wrong, no matter the cause. Even if he was yelling, that doesn't justify hitting back. People should resolve arguments verbally, not through physical aggression.\n\nThere's also the edit about a troll account and a random comment, which might be irrelevant but shows the post might have been a bit chaotic. However, the main issue is the punch. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, she's in the wrong). The key point is that physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. Even in self-defense, there are nuances, but here it's mutual escalation in an argument, not self-defense. She should have de-escalated instead of resorting to violence.\n"
