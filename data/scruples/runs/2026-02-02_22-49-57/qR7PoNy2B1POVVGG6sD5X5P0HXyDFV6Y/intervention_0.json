It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for punching her husband during an argument. The scenario is that they had a political argument, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. The author is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She says they usually ignore their political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking, which led her to hit him. Closed fist to the face, causing a small bruise. Now she's considering apologizing and thinks it might be the first time this happened.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, physical violence is generally not acceptable in relationships, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression. The fact that she hit him first could be a point here. However, he was also yelling and calling her names, which is emotional abuse. But physical violence is a step further.\n\nThe law often treats mutual physical violence as both parties being at fault, but in this case, only she physically struck him. He responded with verbal abuse. However, even if provoked, using physical force can be seen as crossing a line. There's also the aspect of consent for physical contact in a relationship. Hitting is non-consensual and can be considered assault.\n\nShe's realizing she's wrong in edit 2, which shows some self-awareness. But the question is about being in the wrong. The initial action of hitting is problematic. Even if he was being a jerk, physical violence isn't justified. The fact that she apologized later is positive, but doesn't negate the initial action.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that she is in the wrong. The physical aggression is a serious issue, even if provoked by his verbal abuse. Therefore, the answer should be A for Yes.\n"
