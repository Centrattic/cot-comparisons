It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife, leading to yelling, mockery, and the wife hitting him with a closed fist. The husband then left, and there's some confusion with a fake account.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The argument started with political differences, specifically on abortion. The husband was yelling and mocking, which escalated the situation. The wife responded by hitting him, causing a small bruise. The husband then left, calling her a name.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, physical violence is generally not acceptable in a relationship. Even if there's provocation, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is an act of physical aggression. The wife admits in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, indicating she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The husband's response, while perhaps harsh, doesn't justify her actions. However, his yelling and mockery might have contributed to the escalation. \n\nBut the main point is that physical violence is a clear violation, regardless of the reason. Even if both parties are at fault in the argument, the act of hitting is a separate issue. The wife's action caused harm, so she's in the wrong. The husband's response (leaving and calling her a name) is problematic but doesn't excuse her hitting. \n\nThe fake account edit might be a red herring here, not affecting the core issue. Also, the final edit about \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems irrelevant or possibly a troll. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband despite the provocation.\n"
