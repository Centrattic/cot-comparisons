It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with the author being a Democrat and her husband a Republican. They usually avoid discussing their political differences, but this time it escalated into a big argument. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist. After that, he left, she saw a small bruise on him, he called her a name, and then drove off. She hasn't seen him since. She later realized her actions were wrong and plans to apologize, mentioning it was the first time and they might reconcile.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nLet me consider the key points. Hitting someone is physical violence. Even in the context of an argument, using physical force is generally considered wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might have been provocation, but that doesn't justify a punch. The author admits she was in a fit of rage, which can sometimes be a mitigating factor, but it's still an act of violence. The consequences were a bruise, which is a sign of assault. Legally and ethically, using physical force to harm another person, even in a heated argument, is typically seen as wrong. The author's acknowledgment that she was wrong and plans to apologize is a good sign, but the action itself remains problematic. \n\nEven if the husband was being disrespectful, the appropriate response isn't to hit. It's important to address conflict through communication, not physicality. The fact that it was the first time doesn't excuse it. The author may feel justified in her anger, but the act of hitting is a violation of the other person's body and trust. So, in most moral frameworks, using violence to resolve a disagreement is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
