It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated, leading to the husband yelling and mocking, then the author hitting him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a red flag. Even if there was provocation, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is an act of physical aggression. While the husband was yelling and mocking, which is not acceptable either, the author's response involved physical contact that caused a bruise. \n\nThe edits mention that the author realizes they were wrong and plan to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the initial action of hitting someone, regardless of the context, is a serious issue. The husband's reaction of calling the author a name and leaving might indicate he was upset, but that doesn't justify the physical response. \n\nEven if both parties contributed to the argument, the use of physical violence crosses a line. The author's admission of wrongdoing in the edit suggests they acknowledge this. So, while there might be mutual fault in the argument, the physical act of hitting is typically considered the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
