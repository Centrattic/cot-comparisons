It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a political argument with their husband, he started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she hit him. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's just being a baby.\n\nFirst, physical violence is a big deal in any relationship. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face suggests it was intentional and could have caused harm. The husband's response was to leave, but his calling her a \"bitch\" might have been a reaction to the hit. However, yelling and mocking can be part of an argument, but that doesn't justify violence.\n\nThe user edited later to say they realize they were wrong and plan to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the initial action of hitting someone is a problem. Even in heated arguments, physical aggression crosses a line. There's no excuse for hitting someone, regardless of the argument's nature.\n\nThe husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) was also inappropriate, but that doesn't make the woman's response acceptable. Both parties contributed to the escalation, but the physical act of hitting is a more severe infraction. The key point here is that violence is never acceptable in a relationship, even if there's mutual escalation. The question isn't about who started the argument but about the response to it. \n\nSo the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because she used physical violence, which is a serious mistake regardless of the circumstances.\n"
