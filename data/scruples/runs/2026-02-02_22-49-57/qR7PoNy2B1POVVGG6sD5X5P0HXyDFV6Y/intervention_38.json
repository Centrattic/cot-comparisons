It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument, differing on abortion (he's Republican, she's Democrat). The argument escalated, he started yelling and mocking her, then she hit him with a closed fist. He left, came back with a bruise, called her a bitch, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him.\n\nIn the edits, she mentions she realizes her action was wrong and plans to apologize. Also, there's a troll comment at the end which might be a red herring.\n\nNow, considering the details. The initial question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, physical violence in a relationship is usually considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was yelling and mocking her, hitting him is a physical assault. While his behavior contributed to the escalation, that doesn't make her action justified. In most societal standards, using physical force to resolve an argument is problematic. However, if there was a history of abuse or if she felt threatened, that might change things, but the story doesn't mention that. She says this was the first time such a thing happened. She also admits she was wrong, which shows self-awareness.\n\nSo, even though the husband's behavior was inappropriate (yelling, mocking), her response of hitting him is not justified. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
