It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she and her husband had a political argument about abortion. He's Republican, she's Democrat. They usually don't focus on political differences, but this time it got big. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left, and they haven't seen each other since. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles involved here. Physical violence in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is generally considered wrong because it's an aggressive act that can cause harm. The husband did yell and mock her, which is disrespectful and could be seen as abusive behavior. However, responding with physical violence, even in anger, escalates the situation and can have legal and emotional consequences.\n\nThe author later admits in an edit that she realizes her actions were wrong and plans to apologize. This shows some self-awareness. But the initial act of hitting someone, regardless of the reason, is a problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn many contexts, any physical aggression is considered a mistake because it can lead to a cycle of violence and harm the relationship. Even if the other person was being offensive, using physical force isn't the accepted solution. So, from a general standpoint, the author's action is not justified, and she is in the wrong. The husband's behavior was also inappropriate, but that doesn't make her hitting him acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
