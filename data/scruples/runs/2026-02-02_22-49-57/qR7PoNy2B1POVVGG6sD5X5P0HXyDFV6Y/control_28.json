It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to yelling, mocking, and then a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The argument started over politics, which they usually avoid, but this time escalated. The husband yelled and mocked her, which led her to hit him. She admits she was in a fit of rage, and there was a closed fist hit to the face causing a bruise. Then he left, called her a name, and drove off. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, using physical force in a domestic setting can be problematic. Even if provoked, hitting someone can be considered assault. The fact that she used a closed fist and caused a bruise might count as battery. The husband's yelling and mocking could be seen as provocation, but that doesn't necessarily justify a physical response. \n\nAlso, domestic violence laws typically don't make exceptions for marital relationships. So, regardless of the provocation, hitting someone is generally illegal. The author later admits she was wrong, which shows she realizes the mistake. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nEven if the husband was being abusive verbally, the appropriate response isn't to hit back. There's a difference between self-defense and retaliation. If the husband's actions were threatening her safety, then self-defense could be a consideration, but the scenario doesn't mention that. He just yelled and mocked, then left. So her hitting him after being provoked by words might not be justified. \n\nThe edits also show she plans to apologize and acknowledge her wrongdoing, which reinforces that she's in the wrong. The troll account edit is probably to add drama but doesn't affect the main issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong). She used physical violence, which is wrong regardless of the provocation. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate, hitting him was not an acceptable response.\n"
