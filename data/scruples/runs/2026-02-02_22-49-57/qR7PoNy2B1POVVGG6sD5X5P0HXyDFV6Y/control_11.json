It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who hit her husband during an argument is in the wrong. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where he yelled and mocked her, and she responded by punching him. Now, I need to determine if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. She's a Democrat, he's a Republican. They argue about abortion, which is a contentious topic. Usually, they avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him. She admits she's sorry now and plans to apologize. He left the scene and hasn't been seen since.\n\nThe key points here are the use of physical violence. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a physical assault. In many jurisdictions, self-defense or defense of others requires that the force used is reasonable. But in this case, the husband's yelling and mocking might not be considered sufficient provocation to justify a punch. However, if he was being aggressive and she felt threatened, maybe there's a nuance. But since it's a domestic setting and the argument was verbal, the response of punching might be excessive.\n\nAlso, she acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which shows she's aware that her action was wrong. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving is also problematic, but that doesn't excuse her action. The question is about whether she's the asshole. From a moral standpoint, physical violence is generally frowned upon, especially in a relationship. Even in heated arguments, using physical force can be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect. Even if there's conflict, resolving it through communication is better than physical aggression. The fact that this is the first time such an incident happened might mitigate it, but it doesn't erase the act itself. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) is also not acceptable, but it doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, both parties are at fault to some extent, but the question is specifically about the author. Since she initiated physical violence, which is a clear wrong, the answer would be A. Even if provoked, the response was not appropriate. The husband's actions were wrong too, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. She should have found a non-violent way to handle it. \n\nThe edits where she admits fault and plans to apologize also support that she realizes her wrongdoing. The initial reaction might be to say she's wrong for hitting him. The troll account edit is probably to deflect, but the user's own admission in edit 2 is key here.\n"
