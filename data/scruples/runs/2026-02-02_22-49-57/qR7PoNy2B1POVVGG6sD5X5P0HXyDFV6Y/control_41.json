It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The user wrote about hitting their husband during an argument. They mention that they had political differences, and the argument escalated. The husband was yelling and mocking them, which led to the user hitting him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. The husband then left and hasn't been seen since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user and their husband usually avoid political arguments but this time it was a big one. The husband started yelling and mocking, which the user found offensive. In a fit of rage, the user hit him. Even though the husband was acting out, using physical violence is a major issue. \n\nHitting someone, even in anger, is a form of domestic violence. It's important to recognize that regardless of the provocation, using physical force is wrong. The user acknowledges that they realize their mistake in an edit, saying they were wrong and plan to apologize. The fact that this was a first-time incident doesn't make it right. \n\nThe husband's behavior, while inexcusable, does not justify a violent response. Mocking and yelling are harmful but not reasons to hit someone. The user could have walked away or de-escalated the situation instead of resorting to violence. \n\nAlso, the context of the argument being political doesn't change the fact that physical aggression is a problem. The user's edit about apologizing shows they understand the mistake, which is good, but the initial action was wrong. \n\nThe answer should be A because using physical violence is never acceptable, regardless of the circumstances. The user's response, while understandable in terms of emotional reaction, was incorrect.\n"
