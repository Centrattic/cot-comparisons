It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife about abortion. The argument escalates, he starts yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hits him with a closed fist. He leaves, and she hasn't seen him since. The author is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They usually ignore their political differences, which is good. But this argument was big. He started yelling and mocking her, which could be a trigger. She responded with physical violence. Even if provoked, hitting someone is a form of assault. In most places, mutual combat isn't a legal defense, but the moral aspect is tricky. \n\nShe admits she was in the heat of the moment, which might show impulsiveness. The husband's reaction\u2014leaving and not responding\u2014could indicate he's hurt or angry. The author later says she's going to apologize, which is a positive step. But the act itself is problematic. \n\nEven if he was being abusive (yelling, mocking), the appropriate response isn't to hit. There are non-violent ways to handle conflict. So, while the husband may have contributed to the escalation, the author's decision to hit him is still wrong. The answer is likely A (she's in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Maybe they're considering the provocation. However, violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, even if provoked. So I should stick with A.\n"
