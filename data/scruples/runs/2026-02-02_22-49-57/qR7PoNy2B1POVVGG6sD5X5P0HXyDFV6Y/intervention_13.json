It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for hitting their husband. They had a political argument about abortion, which they usually avoid, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a rage, she punched him. He got a small bruise, then left and hasn't been seen since. She admits she might apologize and says it was the first time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is a big deal. Even if there was provocation, like yelling and mocking, hitting someone is a form of abuse. The fact that she used a closed fist to hit his face is important because that can cause injury. He then called her a name and left, which adds to the tension.\n\nShe acknowledges her mistake in an edit, which is good. But the initial question is whether she's in the wrong. In most cases, using physical force in a domestic dispute is considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if he was being an ass, hitting him doesn't justify it. Both parties should resolve conflicts without violence. The husband's actions (yelling, mocking) are bad too, but the physical act of hitting is a more severe boundary crossing. So, even though the situation is mutual in terms of conflict, the author's action is more egregious. Therefore, the answer would be A, she is in the wrong.\n"
