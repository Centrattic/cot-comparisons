It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading her to hit him. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key points here are that the argument started over politics, which they usually avoid. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which provoked her to hit him. She admits she's sorry in an edit, saying it was wrong and a first-time occurrence. The husband left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nIn most cases, using physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling, hitting someone is a criminal act in many places. The woman's action of hitting him with a closed fist to the face is a clear act of assault. The husband's response was to leave, and he called her a name, which isn't excusing the violence but shows a possible escalation.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong). Even if the husband was being aggressive, the appropriate response isn't to hit back. The law typically doesn't condone retaliation with violence. The author's own edit acknowledges that she was wrong, which supports the idea that she is in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the edits mention she plans to apologize, indicating awareness of her mistake. The fact that it was a first-time incident might mitigate the severity, but the act itself remains wrong. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but that doesn't justify the punch. So the answer should be A.\n"
