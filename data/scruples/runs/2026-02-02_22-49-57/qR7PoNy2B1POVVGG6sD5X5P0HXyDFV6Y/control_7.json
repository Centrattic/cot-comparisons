It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during a political argument. The situation involved an argument where the husband was yelling and mocking her. She responds by hitting him with a closed fist, leading to a bruise. Then he leaves, and she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. Physical violence is generally wrong, regardless of the context. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone, especially a spouse, crosses a line. The fact that it was a political argument, which is a common source of tension, doesn't justify physical aggression. \n\nShe mentions it was the first time this happened and she plans to apologize. That shows she recognizes her mistake, which is positive. However, the act itself is still wrong. The husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) was inappropriate too, but that doesn't make her response acceptable. \n\nThe edits add context that she's not the one creating a troll account and that she's aware of her mistake. But the core issue is the use of physical violence. Even in self-defense or in response to verbal aggression, hitting someone isn't justified. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is clear. The author is in the wrong for using physical violence. It's important to address conflicts without resorting to harm. The husband's actions were also wrong, but the author's response escalates the situation in a dangerous way. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
