It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that she and her husband had a political argument, he was being loud and mocking, and she hit him. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She later edited to say she realizes she was wrong and will apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions from a moral standpoint. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a physical aggression. Even if the husband was being mean, using physical violence is generally not acceptable. The fact that she used a closed fist to hit his face caused a bruise, which is a form of assault. \n\nIn many societies, using physical force in a domestic setting can be seen as a serious issue. The woman acknowledges she was wrong in her edit, which shows she recognizes her mistake. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving might be his way of handling conflict, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nHowever, the context of the argument matters. They usually avoid political differences, but this time it escalated. The husband's yelling and mocking could be seen as provocation, but that's not an excuse for physical violence. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, assault is typically considered wrong regardless of provocation. Emotionally, she acted in a rage, which people can understand, but actions have consequences. The fact that she's willing to apologize is a positive step, but the initial action still needs to be judged.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though there were tensions, the act of hitting him makes her at fault. The answer is A.\n"
