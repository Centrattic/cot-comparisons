It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is a political argument where the husband started yelling and mocking her, leading to her punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion, with differing views. They usually avoid the topic, but this time it escalated. The husband yelled and mocked, and she hit him. Then he left, called her a name, and drove off. She hasn't seen him since.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author admits she hit him with a closed fist, which caused a bruise. Even though he was being abusive, using physical violence is a problem. The husband's actions were inappropriate too, but the question is about her. In most places, even if provoked, hitting someone is considered assault. However, self-defense might be a factor if there was immediate danger. But yelling and mocking might not meet the threshold for self-defense requiring physical retaliation.\n\nAlso, the author later edits say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the initial act of hitting someone is still a breach, regardless of provocation. Even if both are at fault, the act of physical violence is a red flag. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) is also poor, but that doesn't justify her action.\n\nSo, while the husband's behavior was wrong, the author's choice to use physical violence makes her also at fault. Therefore, she is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
