It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that she hit her husband after an argument. He was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions were wrong. Physical violence in a relationship is generally considered a serious issue. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that he was yelling and mocking her might contribute to the situation, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. \n\nIn many legal and ethical contexts, using physical violence to resolve a conflict is not acceptable. However, if there was a situation of self-defense, that could be a factor. But the scenario doesn't indicate that she was in immediate danger. The argument was political, and while he was yelling and mocking, that's not physical aggression. So self-defense might not apply here.\n\nThe user mentions that she took some time to realize her actions were wrong and plans to apologize. This shows she acknowledges her mistake, but the fact remains that she committed a harmful act. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and leaving is also problematic, but that doesn't make her actions right.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for using physical violence during an argument. Even if tensions were high, hitting someone is not an acceptable response. The answer should be A.\n"
