It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she punches him. The husband then leaves, and she hasn't seen him since. The user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is generally frowned upon, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive or mocking, using physical force is usually considered inappropriate. The key points here are that the author hit her husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise, and now the husband is upset and left. \n\nThe author acknowledges in an edit that she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. This shows some self-awareness, but the act itself still stands. In most societal and legal contexts, hitting someone, even in anger, is considered a form of assault. The fact that the husband was yelling and mocking might be seen as provocation, but that doesn't justify the physical response.\n\nAlso, the edits mention a troll account and a later edit with a racial slur, which might indicate some level of trolling or the post not being entirely serious. However, the initial question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The presence of a troll doesn't change the fact that using physical violence is typically wrong.\n\nSo, even though the husband's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response crosses a line into physical aggression. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
