It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where he yelled and mocked her, and she hit him, causing a bruise. Then he left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She mentions they usually ignore political differences, but this time it escalated. He was yelling and mocking, which could be provocation. However, physical violence is never acceptable, even in the heat of an argument. Hitting someone, even in response to yelling, is a form of assault. \n\nThe edits show she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. She says it was the first time. But the initial act is still a problem. Even if provoked, using physical force crosses a line. The husband's response (calling her a name and leaving) might be his way of dealing with the situation, but that doesn't justify her actions. \n\nAlso, the troll account mention adds confusion but doesn't change the facts of the original incident. The key point is that physical aggression is not acceptable in a relationship, regardless of provocation. So the author is wrong for hitting her husband.\n"
