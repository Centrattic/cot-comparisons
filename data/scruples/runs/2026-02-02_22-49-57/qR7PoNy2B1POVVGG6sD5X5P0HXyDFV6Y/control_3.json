It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hitting her husband. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user mentions that they had an argument about politics, specifically abortion, with her Republican husband versus her being a Democrat. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time the argument escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left and hasn't been seen since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's being a baby. She later edited her post to say she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, but then there's an edit with a possible troll and a random last edit.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of hitting. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. While the husband was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful, using a closed fist to hit someone is a form of assault. Even in the heat of an argument, resorting to physical violence is a problem. \n\nShe mentions it was the first time this happened. However, the fact remains that she used physical force. The husband's response was to leave, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The user herself later acknowledges that she was wrong and will apologize, which shows she's aware of the mistake. But the question is whether she was in the wrong in the first place.\n\nThere's also the context of mutual disrespect. He was yelling and mocking, which is part of the problem. But even if someone is being abusive, hitting back doesn't make it right. The cycle of violence can escalate, and physical contact is a serious issue in relationships. \n\nThe edits add that someone made a troll account pretending to be her husband, but that's probably not relevant to the main issue. The user taking responsibility in the edit shows she's reflecting, but the initial action is still the focus.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though there was provocation, the act of hitting is a violation. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
