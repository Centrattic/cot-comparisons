It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has political differences, which led to an argument. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. After that, he left and hasn't returned, calling her a \"bitch.\" The user is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are about physical violence in a relationship. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, does that justify a physical response? Generally, using physical violence as a response to conflict, even if provoked, is usually seen as problematic. It's about respecting each other's boundaries and not escalating the situation. \n\nIn many places, hitting someone, even in anger, is considered assault. So legally, she might be at fault. Emotionally, while the husband's behavior was inappropriate (yelling and mocking), hitting someone can cause harm and is a form of domestic violence. It's important to address conflicts without physical aggression.\n\nThe user also edited later to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows self-awareness, but the initial action is still the focus here. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not whether she'll make things right afterward.\n\nThe husband's actions (yelling, mocking) are not excusing her actions. Both parties should manage their anger, but physical violence crosses a line. So, yes, she is in the wrong for hitting him. Even in heated arguments, physical contact with the intent to harm is not acceptable. The answer should be A.\n"
