It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a husband and wife with differing views on abortion. They usually avoid the topic, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him with a closed fist. He left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him or if he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was yelling and mocking her, hitting him crosses a line. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nShe acknowledges in her edit that she realizes her actions were wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. However, the act itself\u2014hitting someone in the face with a closed fist is a form of assault, which is illegal in many places. Even in the heat of the moment, using physical force is a problem.\n\nThe husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off might be his way of handling it, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties might have contributed to the escalation, but the presence of physical violence usually makes the person who used it at fault. \n\nAlso, the edit about a troll account pretending to be her husband is a red herring here. The main issue is her action. The final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP...\" seems like a joke or a meme, which might indicate she's not entirely serious, but the initial situation is real.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and legal standards, using physical violence in a relationship is typically seen as wrong. So even if there was provocation, the response of hitting is not acceptable. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
