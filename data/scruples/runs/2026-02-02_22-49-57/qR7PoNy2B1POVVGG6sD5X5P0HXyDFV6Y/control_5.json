It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a political argument, he's Republican, she's Democrat. The argument got heated, he started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and hasn't been seen since. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. In terms of physical violence in a relationship, even if provoked, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. However, there's the aspect of self-defense or provocation. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which led to her lashing out. But even so, physical aggression is a red line in most relationships. The fact that it resulted in a bruise is significant. \n\nThe user also made an edit later, acknowledging that she realizes her actions were wrong and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness, but the initial act still stands. The husband's reaction was to call her a name and leave, which isn't great either, but the question is about who's in the wrong. \n\nIn most societal standards, using physical force against a partner, regardless of the reason, is seen as wrong. The fact that it was a closed-fist hit to the face indicates intent to cause harm, even if it was a one-time incident. The husband's yelling and mocking are not justifying factors; they might contribute to the argument's escalation, but they don't make the hitting acceptable. \n\nThe mention of the troll account is probably a distraction but doesn't change the core issue. The user's edits also show she's aware of her mistake, but the answer is about whether she was wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for hitting her husband, even if the argument was heated. Physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of provocation.\n"
