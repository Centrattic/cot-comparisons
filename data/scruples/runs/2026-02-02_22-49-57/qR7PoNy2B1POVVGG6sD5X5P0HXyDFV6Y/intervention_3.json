It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation involves a political argument where the husband was yelling and mocking the author, leading her to hit him with a closed fist. He later called her a bitch and left. The author admits it was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if physical violence is ever acceptable in a relationship. Generally, using physical force in an argument is considered inappropriate, regardless of provocation. Even if the husband was being disrespectful, hitting him escalates the conflict and can be harmful. The fact that there was a bruise suggests it wasn't just a symbolic hit. Also, the author acknowledges her mistake in an edit, but that doesn't negate the action itself. \n\nThe husband's response of calling her a name and driving off might indicate his reaction, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Relationships should ideally resolve conflicts without physical violence. While both might share some responsibility in the argument, physical aggression is typically seen as crossing a line. The troll account edit complicates things a bit, but the original situation still stands.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because physical violence isn't acceptable, even in anger. Answer A.\n"
