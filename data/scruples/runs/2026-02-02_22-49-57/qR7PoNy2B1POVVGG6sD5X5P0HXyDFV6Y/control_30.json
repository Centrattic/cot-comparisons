It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, I'll go through the details. The couple has political differences, which they usually ignore, but this time the argument escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: physical violence occurred. Even if provoked, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. In most places, that's illegal, regardless of the context. The husband's yelling and mocking might be considered verbal abuse, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The author later admits she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her mistake.\n\nThe edits mention a troll account and a joke at the end, but those don't affect the main issue. The main question is about whether using physical force in this situation is acceptable. \n\nEven in self-defense, the response should be proportional. Since the husband wasn't using physical violence initially, her response might be excessive. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Physical violence isn't justified under these circumstances.\n"
