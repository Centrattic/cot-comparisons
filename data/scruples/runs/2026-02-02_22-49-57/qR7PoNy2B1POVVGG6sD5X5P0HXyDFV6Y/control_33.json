It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They had an argument with their husband about politics, specifically abortion, which led to yelling and mocking from him. The author then hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. The husband left and hasn't been seen since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, using physical force against another person, even in the context of an argument, is illegal. Assault charges can apply even if it's a spouse. The fact that it was a closed fist hit to the face suggests it's a deliberate act, which could be considered assault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hitting someone is generally considered wrong. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, using physical violence escalates the situation and can be seen as a breach of trust and respect in the relationship. The author later admits they realize they were wrong, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nThe husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off might be his way of handling the situation, but that doesn't justify her actions. However, his behavior (yelling and mocking) likely contributed to the conflict. But in terms of who is at fault, the physical act of hitting is a clear wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the author's edits show they are taking responsibility, which is a positive step. However, the initial action of hitting is still a problem. The answer should reflect that the author is in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
