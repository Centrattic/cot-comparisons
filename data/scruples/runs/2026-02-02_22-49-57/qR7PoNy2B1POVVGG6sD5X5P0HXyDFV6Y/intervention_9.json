It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a yelling argument, where the husband mocked her, leading her to punch him. Now, I need to consider the dynamics here.\n\nFirst, physical violence in relationships is generally a red flag. Even if there was provocation, using physical force can escalate tensions and cause harm. The woman admits she hit him with a closed fist, resulting in a bruise. That's assault, regardless of the context. The husband's response\u2014calling her a name and driving off\u2014doesn't justify her actions either. Both sides acted inappropriately, but the question is about the woman's responsibility.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but in the edits, the author acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize. However, just because someone apologizes doesn't mean the action wasn't wrong. The key point is that using violence to resolve a disagreement is never acceptable. Even if the husband was being an ass, hitting him was the wrong choice. The fact that this is a first-time occurrence might mitigate it somewhat, but it doesn't erase the wrongdoing. So, the answer would be that she's in the wrong (A).\n"
