It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The author says they usually avoid political arguments because of their differing views on abortion. This time, the argument escalated, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She's wondering if she was in the wrong or if he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in relationships is a serious issue. Even if there's provocation, using physical force can be problematic. The user argues that the husband was yelling and mocking, which might have been a trigger. However, retaliation with violence can lead to a cycle of harm. The author mentions that this was a closed-fist hit to the face, which could be considered assault. In many places, mutual violence can have legal implications, but the ethical aspect here is about right and wrong.\n\nThe author's edit 2 acknowledges she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows self-awareness, but the initial action is still the focus. Even if the husband was at fault in the argument, hitting him is not justified. Emotionally charged arguments can lead to poor decisions, but that doesn't excuse the action. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off adds to the conflict, but that doesn't make her hitting him right.\n\nAlso, the mention of a troll account pretending to be her husband complicates things, but the main issue is the physical altercation. The key point is that violence is never acceptable in a relationship, regardless of the provocation. So even if the husband was being an asshole, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, she is in the wrong).\n"
