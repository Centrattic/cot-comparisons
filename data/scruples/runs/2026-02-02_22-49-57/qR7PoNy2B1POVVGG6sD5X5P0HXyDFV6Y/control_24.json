It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole for punching him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The argument was about politics, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which could be seen as emotional abuse or aggression. The wife, in a fit of rage, hit him. \n\nLegally, using a closed fist to hit someone, even in an argument, can be considered assault in many jurisdictions. Physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. So legally, she might be in the wrong because she used physical force.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the husband was being verbally aggressive, hitting him escalates the situation. It's important to resolve conflicts without violence. The fact that she realized her mistake later and wants to apologize is a positive step, but the act itself is still wrong.\n\nThe husband's reaction of leaving and calling her a \"bitch\" isn't right either, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both sides have issues, but the use of physical violence is a clear transgression. She acknowledges her mistake in the edit, which shows she understands it was wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she resorted to violence, which is not acceptable regardless of the circumstances. Even if the husband was being rude, hitting him was the wrong choice.\n"
