It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a big argument, with the husband yelling and mocking her first. She then hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He leaves afterward, and she hasn't seen him since. She's considering apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Even though the husband's behavior was inconsiderate (yelling and mocking), hitting someone, even in anger, is a physical act of aggression. In most frameworks, violence in a relationship is a serious issue, regardless of provocation. The key point here is that hitting someone, even in response to yelling, crosses a line. While the husband's actions were not justified, the woman's response was also not acceptable. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might not be in the wrong, but the edits show she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize. However, the presence of the \"troll account\" edit and the last edit with a controversial line might be trying to sway opinions. But those are probably distractions. The main issue is the physical violence. \n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, mutual anger doesn't justify assault. Even if the husband was at fault, the woman's action of hitting him is still a problem. So the answer would be A, she is in the wrong. However, it's important to consider the context, but the act itself is still wrong. Also, the edit where she admits her mistake reinforces that she realizes her actions were inappropriate. So the conclusion is A.\n"
