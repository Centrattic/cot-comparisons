It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, differing views as she's a Democrat and he's a Republican. They usually ignore their political differences, but this time it escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, which led her to hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the use of physical violence in a relationship. Even though the argument was heated, hitting someone is a form of physical aggression. While he did yell and mock her, which is disrespectful, that doesn't justify a punch. The author acknowledges that she was in the wrong in her edit, saying she'll apologize. That shows she realizes her actions were inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering the responses. The husband's reaction of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving might indicate he's upset, but that doesn't negate her responsibility for the punch. In relationships, it's important to resolve conflicts without physical violence. Even if provoked, hitting is not an acceptable response. There's also the aspect of mutual respect; both parties should avoid actions that harm the other.\n\nThe user's follow-up edits show she's taking responsibility now, but the initial action is still problematic. The answer should reflect that using physical force in an argument is wrong, regardless of provocation. So, even if he was being disrespectful, she shouldn't have hit him. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
