It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to an argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she responds by punching him. The husband then leaves and she hasn't seen him since. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both parties have differing political views, which they usually ignore. This time, the argument escalates. The husband starts yelling and mocking her, which is a form of emotional abuse or at least disrespectful behavior. The author, in a fit of rage, hits him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. Then the husband calls her a name and leaves.\n\nSo, physical violence is a key point here. Even if the husband was being rude, using physical aggression is generally not acceptable. The author acknowledges that in her edit, saying she realizes it was wrong and plans to apologize. That's a sign she sees the issue. However, the husband's actions (yelling, mocking, calling her a name) are also problematic. But in terms of who is at fault, the physical hit is a legal and ethical issue. Hitting someone, even in an argument, is a form of assault. So legally, the author could be in the wrong for committing an assault. \n\nBut the post is asking if she's the asshole. The community might consider the context\u2014like the husband's provocation\u2014but generally, using physical violence is frowned upon regardless. The husband's behavior isn't excusing her actions, but it's part of the situation. However, in terms of right and wrong, the author initiated physical violence, which is a clear violation. So the answer is likely A, yes, she's in the wrong. The edits show she admits fault, which reinforces that. Even if she was provoked, the response was not justified. So the answer should be A.\n"
