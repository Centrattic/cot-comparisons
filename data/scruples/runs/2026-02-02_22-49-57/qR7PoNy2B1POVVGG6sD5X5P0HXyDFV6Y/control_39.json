It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple having a political argument, with the husband yelling and mocking her, leading her to hit him. She then apologizes in an edit and says she'll make up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of hitting him makes her the asshole. The key points here are that she hit him first, even if it was in response to his yelling. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of provocation. Even if he was being abusive, she using a closed fist to hit his face caused a bruise, which is a form of assault. \n\nShe later apologized, saying it was the first time and they can make up. But the initial act of hitting someone is a problem. The husband's reaction of driving off might be part of the conflict, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. The fact that she admitted her mistake in an edit shows she realizes it was wrong, but the question is about whether she was in the wrong at the time.\n\nEven if he was acting aggressively, using physical violence is not an appropriate response. The answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because hitting someone is a form of domestic violence and is never acceptable. The fact that she apologized might mitigate some things, but the act itself is still wrong. The other edits don't change the fact that she used violence first.\n"
