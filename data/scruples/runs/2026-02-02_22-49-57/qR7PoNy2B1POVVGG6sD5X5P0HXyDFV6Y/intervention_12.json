It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. She mentions they usually ignore political differences but had a big argument where he started yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a bruise. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Physical violence is a major issue in relationships. Even if there was provocation, hitting someone is a serious action. The husband was yelling and mocking, which is disrespectful, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The author admits she was in a rage, which is an emotional state where people act without thinking, but that doesn't excuse the action.\n\nIn many places, mutual assault can lead to legal consequences, but the question is about moral wrongdoing. The fact that she hit him first is significant. Even if he was being an asshole, using physical violence escalates the situation. She later admits she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness. However, the initial action is still problematic. So while both might have contributed to the argument, the physical hit is on her. The answer is likely A, she's in the wrong.\n"
