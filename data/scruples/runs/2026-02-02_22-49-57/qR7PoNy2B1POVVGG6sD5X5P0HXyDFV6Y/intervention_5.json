It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a political argument between the couple. They usually avoid discussing their differences, so this was a big one. The husband starts yelling and mocking her. She gets angry and hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then he leaves, maybe to cool off. She hasn't seen him since. She later realizes her action was wrong and wants to apologize, but the husband calls her a \"bitch\" and drives off.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it differently. The key points here are mutual responsibility. Even if the husband was being rude and yelling, using physical force is a problem. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of domestic violence, which is generally considered unacceptable. The author admits she was wrong in the edit, so she's taking responsibility. However, the husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and leaving adds complexity, but it doesn't justify her hitting him.\n\nBut wait, the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed to the escalation. However, that doesn't make her hitting him acceptable. Both actions are problematic. The author's first-time mistake and willingness to apologize are good signs, but the act itself is still wrong. The husband's reaction (calling her names and leaving) is also not okay, but that doesn't negate her responsibility for the punch.\n\nIn most societal standards, any physical violence in a relationship is a red flag. Even if provoked, the response should be non-violent. So, even though the husband's behavior was poor, the author's action of hitting him crosses a line. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, she is in the wrong.\n"
