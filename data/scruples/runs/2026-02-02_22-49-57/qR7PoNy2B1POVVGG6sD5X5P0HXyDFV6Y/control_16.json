It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left afterward and hasn't been seen since. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally a big no-no. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, hitting him was a physical response. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face suggests it was intentional, even if it was a moment of anger. The author later acknowledges she was wrong and plans to apologize, which shows some self-awareness, but the act itself is problematic.\n\nVerbal abuse (yelling, mocking) is still abuse and can be very hurtful, but it's not the same as physical violence. In most cases, using physical force in response to verbal abuse doesn't make it okay because it can escalate the situation dangerously. The bruises from a punch can lead to more serious injuries, even if they were minor this time. Also, the husband driving off afterward might indicate he left because he was scared or wanted to avoid further conflict, but that doesn't excuse the hit.\n\nThe edits add some context: she realizes she was wrong and wants to apologize, which is a good step. However, the initial act of hitting someone is a form of domestic violence, regardless of the provocation. Society generally frowns upon any physical violence in relationships because it sets a harmful precedent and can lead to cycles of abuse.\n\nAnother point is that arguments about politics can be contentious, but they shouldn't lead to physical harm. They had ignored differences before, so this was an escalation. The husband's yelling and mocking contributed to the tension, but that doesn't justify her response. Healthy relationships involve communication without violence.\n\nEven if the husband was being an ass, the appropriate response isn't to hit back. There are better ways to de-escalate, like taking a break from the argument, seeking counseling, etc. The fact that she hit him first is a key factor here. The fact that she hasn't seen him since also raises concerns about his safety and the potential for ongoing conflict.\n\nThe troll account edit is probably a red herring but shows that the situation might have gotten more attention than intended. The final edit about gamers is random, maybe to distract or add a joke, but not relevant to the actual question.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author used physical violence, which is wrong regardless of the circumstances. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, that doesn't make her actions acceptable. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
