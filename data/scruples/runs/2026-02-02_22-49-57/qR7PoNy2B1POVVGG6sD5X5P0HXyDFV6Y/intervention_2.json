It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddits-style post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during a political argument. The husband started yelling and mocking, which led the author to punch him. The husband left after a few hours, and the author is now unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they usually avoid political arguments but this time it got heated. The husband was yelling and mocking, which escalated the situation. The author hit him in a fit of rage with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. Then the husband left, calling the author a name. The author now acknowledges they were wrong and plan to apologize, but initially asked if they're the asshole.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, physical violence in a relationship is typically seen as unacceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being abusive, hitting him doesn't make the author right. However, the husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) might be considered part of the problem. But in most cases, any form of physical aggression is considered a mistake because it can lead to more harm and doesn't resolve issues.\n\nThe author's edit says they realize they were wrong and will apologize, which shows some self-awareness. The fact that it was a first-time incident might be a mitigating factor, but the action itself is still problematic. The husband's response of driving off and not communicating further might be an issue too, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the Reddits-style post is asking for opinions, so the community might weigh in on whether the action was a justified reaction or not. But legally and ethically, physical assault is generally not acceptable. Even in self-defense, the response should be proportionate. A closed fist to the face causing a bruise could be seen as excessive, especially if verbal abuse isn't a justification for physical violence.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). Even though the argument was heated, using physical violence is not acceptable. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but the author's action crosses a line that's harder to justify.\n"
