It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation involves a political argument between a Republican and a Democrat, leading to yelling and mockery from the husband, which resulted in the woman hitting him. There's an edit where she acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, and another edit where she mentions a troll account.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The argument was about politics, specifically abortion. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this one escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her. She hit him with a closed fist to the face. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She says it was a moment of rage. In her edit, she admits it was wrong, so she's showing remorse.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. Physically hitting someone is generally considered wrong, even in a heated argument. Assault is illegal and can have legal consequences. Emotional abuse (yelling, mocking) is also wrong, but the physical action crosses a line. Even if provoked, using violence is not acceptable. The fact that she acknowledges her mistake in an edit shows she realizes this, but the initial action is still problematic. So, the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she used physical violence, which is not justified regardless of the provocation. However, the husband's behavior (yelling, mocking) also contributed to the escalation. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Legally and ethically, hitting someone is a clear wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
