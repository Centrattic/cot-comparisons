It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. He then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's worried if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him is a form of physical aggression that can escalate conflicts. The fact that she acknowledges her actions as wrong in the edit and plans to apologize shows some self-awareness, but that doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility. \n\nIn many legal systems, mutual physical violence can affect the outcome of any legal issues, but the question here is more about moral responsibility. The key point is that using physical force to resolve an argument is typically considered inappropriate. While the husband's behavior was inexcusable (yelling and mocking), the appropriate response isn't to hit. Non-violent communication or walking away is usually advised.\n\nThe user also mentions that this was the first time such a thing happened. While that might mitigate the situation somewhat, it doesn't justify the action. The fact that there's a troll account pretending to be the husband complicates the situation, but the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of relationships, the immediate response to conflict should avoid physical harm. The husband's reaction of calling her a name and driving off is also problematic, but again, hitting isn't a solution. The author's willingness to apologize is a positive step, but the act itself is still wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A, since hitting, even in anger, is not acceptable. The husband's behavior was poor, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both could be at fault in their escalation, but the physical aspect makes her the one in the wrong here according to social norms.\n"
