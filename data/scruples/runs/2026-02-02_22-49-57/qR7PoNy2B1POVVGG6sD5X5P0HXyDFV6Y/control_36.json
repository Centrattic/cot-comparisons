It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation is that they had a political disagreement, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since. The user wants to know if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking her, using a closed fist to hit someone's face is a form of assault. The fact that the husband ended up with a bruise indicates that there was actual physical harm, which makes it more serious.\n\nThe user edited the post to say she realizes she was wrong and plans to apologize. That shows she acknowledges her mistake, which is good. But the initial action is still an issue. In most legal and ethical frameworks, using physical force to resolve an argument isn't justified, even if the other person was being abusive verbally. There are other ways to de-escalate a situation, like taking a break from the conversation or seeking counseling.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have contributed to the tension. But that doesn't excuse her hitting him. So, even if there was provocation, the act of hitting is a problem. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong because physical violence is not acceptable in a relationship, regardless of the circumstances. The edit where she realizes her mistake supports that she understands she was wrong, which aligns with answer A.\n"
