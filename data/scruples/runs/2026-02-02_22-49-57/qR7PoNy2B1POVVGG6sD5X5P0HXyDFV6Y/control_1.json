It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with political differences\u2014husband is Republican, wife is Democrat. They had an argument about abortion, which led to the husband yelling and mocking her. In a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then called her a bitch and drove off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). In most societies, using physical violence in a relationship is considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and being disrespectful, hitting him wouldn't be justified. The wife later admits in her edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which indicates she acknowledges her wrongdoing. The husband's reaction might have been inappropriate too, but the question is about the wife's actions. Physical assault is generally not acceptable, so the answer is likely A.\n"
