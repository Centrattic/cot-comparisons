It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her, and she responds by hitting him with a closed fist. He leaves after getting a bruise, and she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which is disrespectful and could escalate tensions. The woman, in a fit of rage, hit him, causing a bruise. Even though the argument was contentious, using physical violence is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. \n\nThe edits show that the woman later acknowledges her mistake and plans to apologize, which is a responsible step. However, the initial act of hitting someone is a clear use of physical aggression. Legal and social norms typically condemn any form of physical assault, even between spouses. It's important to consider that arguments should be resolved without physical harm, and the response to yelling or verbal abuse shouldn't involve hitting.\n\nThere's also a mention of a troll account, but that's unrelated to the main incident. The key points are the escalation of the argument into physical violence by the woman. Even if the husband's behavior was inappropriate, hitting him crosses a line. The woman's remorse is noted, but the act itself is still wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because she used physical violence, which is not acceptable regardless of the circumstances. However, it's worth noting that the husband's behavior also contributed to the conflict, but the physical assault is the critical factor here.\n"
