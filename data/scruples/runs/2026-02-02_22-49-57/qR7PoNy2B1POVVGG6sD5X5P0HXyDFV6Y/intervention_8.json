It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The scenario involves political differences leading to a yelling match, and then the wife punches him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband was yelling and mocking her, which escalated the situation. She hit him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He left afterward, and she hasn't seen him since. She later admits she was wrong and plans to apologize.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general standpoint, using physical violence in a relationship is typically considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being aggressive, hitting him back doesn't make it okay. However, there's the context of self-defense. If she felt threatened, maybe that's a factor. But the description says it was an argument where he was mocking her, not necessarily physically threatening her. \n\nAlso, the fact that she later realizes her mistake and wants to apologize is a positive step, but it doesn't negate the action itself. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off could indicate his own issues. But the initial question is about her actions. \n\nIn many cases, any form of physical aggression is a red flag in relationships. Even if the other person is at fault, using violence can lead to cycles of abuse. So, while the husband's behavior was inconsiderate and escalated things, the woman hitting him is still a problem. \n\nAdditionally, the edit about the troll account and the final edit with \"GAMERS RISE UP\" seems like an attempt to derail or humor, which might indicate the original post wasn't entirely serious. But the initial question is genuine. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the husband was being argumentative and mocking, the woman's use of physical violence makes her at fault here. The answer is A.\n"
