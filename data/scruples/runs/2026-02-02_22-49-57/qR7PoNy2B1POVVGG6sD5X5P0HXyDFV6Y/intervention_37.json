It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting their husband. The situation is a political argument where the husband started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. The husband then left and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The argument was about politics, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband's actions of yelling and mocking might be seen as contributing to the escalation. However, physical violence is generally not acceptable, even in the context of an argument. The user mentioned that the husband started yelling, which might be a defense for the woman's actions, but hitting someone is still a violation, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe user also added an edit later acknowledging that what she did was wrong and that she plans to apologize. This shows some self-awareness. However, the initial act of hitting someone in a relationship is a serious issue. Even if the husband was being aggressive, a closed-fist hit to the face is a form of assault. Legal and ethical standards usually don't condone physical violence as a response to an argument, regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the part where she says \"he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off\" \u2013 that might be an attempt to justify her actions, but it's not an excuse. Emotional reactions can lead to regrettable actions, but the responsibility for using physical violence lies with the person who initiated it.\n\nThe edits at the end, including the one about a troll account and \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga,\" might be distractions or attempts to provoke, but the main issue is the initial act. The user's own later admission in edit 2 that she realizes it was wrong is significant. So even if she felt justified at the time, the act itself is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because physical violence is not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. The husband's behavior was inappropriate too, but that doesn't excuse the woman's actions.\n"
