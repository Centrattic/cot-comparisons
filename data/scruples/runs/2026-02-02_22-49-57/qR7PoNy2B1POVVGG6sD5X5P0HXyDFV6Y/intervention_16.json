It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democratic wife. The topic was abortion, which is a sensitive issue. They usually avoid political discussions, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him with a closed fist. He got a bruise, then left, and she hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author admits she hit him, which is a physical act of violence. Even if provoked, using physical force in an argument is generally considered wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might be offensive, but that doesn't justify a punch. The fact that she later realizes her mistake and plans to apologize is a good sign, but the action itself is problematic. Also, the situation might be more complex if there's a history of abuse or if the husband's behavior was particularly harmful. However, based on the info given, the immediate response is that hitting someone is not acceptable regardless of the reason. The author's own edit acknowledges her wrongdoing, so maybe that's a hint. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, yes. Even if the husband was being a jerk, hitting him is not an appropriate response. So the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
