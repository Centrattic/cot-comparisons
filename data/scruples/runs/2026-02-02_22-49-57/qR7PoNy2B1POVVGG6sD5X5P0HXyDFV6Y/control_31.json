It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. She and her husband had a political argument about abortion, which escalated. He started yelling and mocking her, and in a fit of rage, she hit him with a closed fist. He ran off, came back with a bruise, called her a name, and left in his car. She hasn't seen him since. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nNow, the key points here are physical violence. Even though the argument might have been heated, using physical aggression is generally considered wrong. Hitting someone, even in anger, is a form of domestic violence. The husband also yelled and mocked her, which isn't good either, but the question is about who is in the wrong here. \n\nShe later apologized in an edit, saying she realizes she was wrong and it was the first time. But the initial action of hitting him is a problem. In most cases, using physical force to resolve an argument isn't acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was being abusive, hitting back doesn't make it right and can escalate the situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that he left and she hasn't seen him since might indicate that the situation is more serious. The presence of a bruise suggests that there was some injury, which adds to the seriousness of her action. \n\nThe edits are important too. The first edit mentions a troll account, which might be a red herring, but the second edit shows she acknowledges her mistake. However, the original question is whether she's in the wrong, and the initial act of hitting him would be the main issue regardless of her later remorse.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she used physical violence, which is generally considered unacceptable, even in the context of an argument. The husband's behavior was also poor, but the act of hitting someone crosses a line.\n"
