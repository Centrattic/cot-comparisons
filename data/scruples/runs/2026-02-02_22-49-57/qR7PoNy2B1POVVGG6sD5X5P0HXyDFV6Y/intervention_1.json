It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for hitting her husband. The story is that they had a political argument, he started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. The author is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Physical violence in any relationship is a big issue, regardless of the reason. Even if there was provocation, like yelling or mocking, hitting someone is a form of physical aggression. The fact that it was a closed fist to the face means it could cause injury, which it did\u2014there's a bruise mentioned.\n\nThe husband's behavior, yelling and mocking, is not acceptable either. Verbal abuse can escalate conflicts, and it's possible that his actions contributed to the situation. However, the line between verbal and physical abuse is important. While both are problematic, physical violence typically carries more severe consequences.\n\nThe author later edited her post to say she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize. That shows some self-awareness. But the initial action of hitting him is still a problem. Even if it was in a fit of rage, it's not an excuse. People are responsible for their actions, especially when they involve physical harm.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to address conflicts without resorting to violence. There might be underlying issues that need to be discussed with a professional. Also, the fact that the husband left and called her a name isn't helping the situation, but it doesn't justify hitting.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the user claims the person in the story is the author, but there's an edit about a troll account pretending to be the husband. That might be a red herring, but it doesn't change the main issue at hand.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author physically harmed her husband, which is generally considered wrong. While there was provocation, the appropriate response isn't to hit. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), even if both parties contributed to the conflict in different ways.\n"
