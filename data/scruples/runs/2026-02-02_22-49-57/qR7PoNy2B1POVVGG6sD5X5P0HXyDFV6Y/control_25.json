It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument about abortion, which led to yelling and mocking. The husband started yelling and mocking her, then she hit him with a closed fist. He got a small bruise, left, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the main point here is whether her action of hitting him is justified. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nWell, in most contexts, using physical violence in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if there was provocation, like yelling and mocking, hitting someone is a form of assault. She later realized her mistake (edit 2) and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges it was wrong. Also, there's a mention of a troll account, but that seems like a separate issue. The key action here is her hitting him, which is a clear act of physical aggression. Even if the husband was being abusive, her response is still violent. However, sometimes in heated moments, people act out, but that doesn't make it right. The law typically doesn't excuse hitting someone, even in self-defense unless there's immediate danger. In this case, it's an argument, not a life-threatening situation. So, from a moral and legal standpoint, she's probably in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
