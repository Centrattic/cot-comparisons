It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hitting their husband during an argument. The situation involves political differences leading to a heated argument where the husband yells and mocks her. She hits him with a closed fist, causing a small bruise. He then leaves, and she hasn't seen him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the act of hitting someone. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was being verbally abusive, using physical force is a problem. The author admits in the edit that she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her wrongdoing.\n\nThe husband's response of calling her a name and driving off could be part of the escalation, but that doesn't justify the punch. The key point here is that using physical violence is a violation of a partner's safety and trust. It's important to note that mutual respect and non-violent communication are essential in any relationship. Even if the argument was intense, hitting is not an appropriate response. The author's action, though a first-time occurrence, is still an act of physical aggression which can have serious consequences for the relationship and both individuals' well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the follow-up edits indicate that the author is remorseful and plans to apologize, which is positive. However, remorse doesn't negate the wrongfulness of the action itself. It's possible the relationship could recover, but the initial act of hitting is still a mistake. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) was also inappropriate, but that doesn't excuse the punch.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author did commit an act of violence, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
