It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: they had a political argument, he's Republican, she's Democrat. They usually avoid the differences, but this time it got big. He started yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. He left and she hasn't seen him since. She says she will apologize and realizes she was wrong, but she's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here. Physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, regardless of the circumstances. Even if there's provocation, like yelling or mocking, hitting someone is a form of assault. The fact that it's between spouses doesn't make it okay. The author admits she realizes she was wrong, but that doesn't change the fact that the action was wrong. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off is also problematic, but that doesn't justify her hitting him. Both parties acted in ways that escalated the situation. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. Even if he was being an asshole, she hitting him was the wrong choice. There's no justification for physical violence in a disagreement. So even though she's going to apologize and it was her first time, the answer is that she is in the wrong.\n"
