It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the original post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The husband was yelling and mocking her, and the author hit him with a closed fist, leading to a bruise. The husband then left, and the author is questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had a political argument, which can be a sensitive topic. The husband escalated things by yelling and mocking her. The author mentions that they usually avoid political differences but this time it was a big argument. Then, in a fit of rage, she hit him. The key points here are the use of physical violence and the subsequent consequences.\n\nPhysical violence in relationships is generally not acceptable. Even if provoked, hitting someone can be considered abusive. The fact that there's a bruise indicates some level of harm. While the husband's behavior was inappropriate (yelling and mocking), that doesn't justify a physical response. The author later admits she realizes her mistake and plans to apologize, which shows she acknowledges her wrongdoing. \n\nThe edits also mention a troll account and a humorous edit at the end, which might be trying to downplay the seriousness. However, the core issue remains: physical aggression is a problem. Even in heated arguments, using physical force crosses a line. The husband's response of calling her a \"bitch\" and driving off also shows he escalated the situation, but that doesn't make her actions excusable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because she resorted to physical violence. While the husband's behavior was bad, hitting him is not an acceptable response. The answer should be A.\n"
