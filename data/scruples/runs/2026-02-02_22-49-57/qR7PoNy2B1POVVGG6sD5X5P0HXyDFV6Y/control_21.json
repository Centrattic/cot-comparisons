It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for hitting her husband during an argument. The context given is that they have political differences, he was yelling and mocking her, and she hit him with a closed fist. Then he left, and she hasn't seen him since. She also mentions she'll apologize and thinks they can make up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Violence in a relationship is generally a red flag. Even if it's in the heat of an argument, hitting someone is a form of physical aggression. The author acknowledges this and plans to apologize, which shows some level of regret. However, the husband's response of calling her a name and leaving might have been his way of dealing with it, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nNow, the edits at the end are a bit confusing. The third edit says \"GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga.\" This seems like a possible attempt to derail the discussion or might be a typo. The user also mentions a troll account pretending to be the husband. But the main question is about the original situation. \n\nThe title is \"AITA for hitting my husband?\" which is a clear question about her responsibility. The first edit clarifies that the husband isn't a real person in the story (since someone made a troll account pretending to be him). Wait, the user says that the troll account is not her, but she made the original post. Wait, maybe the edits are part of the original post. Let me re-read the post.\n\nOriginal post: The user says she hit her husband in an argument, he left, and now she's asking if she's the asshole. Then she edits to say that someone made a troll account pretending to be her husband, implying that the scenario might be fabricated. Then another edit where she says she realizes she was wrong and will apologize. Also, the last edit is a random phrase that might be a joke or a typo. \n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for hitting him. But the first edit complicates things by suggesting the husband part is a troll. However, the user is the one who posted the original story, so we have to treat it as a real situation unless the meta info changes that. \n\nIn real situations, using physical violence towards a partner is wrong regardless of the provocation. Even if the husband was yelling and mocking, that's not an excuse for hitting. So the answer would be A. But the edits at the end could be a clue that the post is not real. Wait, the user says \"someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\" So maybe the original post is a fake scenario created by someone else, but the user is the one who wrote the original post. The edits might be trying to clarify that. \n\nBut the actual question is about the scenario presented. If the scenario is real (as per the original post), then the answer is A. If the scenario is fake because the husband is a troll, then maybe the user is not in the wrong. But the user's own edits suggest that the husband part is fabricated. However, the person who wrote the original post (the user) is the one who claims to have hit her husband. The question is about the person who wrote the post (the author) in the situation described. \n\nThe user also admits in Edit 2 that she realizes it was wrong and will apologize. So even though she's acknowledging her mistake, the act itself is still wrong. So the answer would be A. The other edits about the troll account might be a distraction or part of the original post's context. The main issue is that she hit her husband, which is a form of domestic violence and is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
