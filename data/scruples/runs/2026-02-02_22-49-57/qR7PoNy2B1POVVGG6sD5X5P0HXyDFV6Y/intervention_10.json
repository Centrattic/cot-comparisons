It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who hit their husband during an argument is in the wrong. The situation involves a political disagreement that escalated into physical violence. The person admits they hit their husband with a closed fist, causing a bruise, and the husband left afterward. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Hitting someone, even in the heat of an argument, is a form of physical assault. Regardless of the provocation, using violence is generally considered wrong. The husband's yelling and mocking might have contributed, but that doesn't justify the physical response. The author later edited their post to admit that they realize their mistake and plan to apologize, which shows self-awareness, but the act itself was still a breach of mutual respect and safety.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to resolve conflicts without violence. Even if both parties are upset, resorting to physical harm can set a dangerous precedent and cause lasting harm. The author's admission that this was the first time and that they think they can reconcile is a positive step, but it doesn't negate the wrongness of the action.\n\nHowever, the husband's behavior also played a role. Yelling and mocking can escalate tensions, and his response of calling the author a \"bitch\" and leaving might indicate he also acted inappropriately. But in terms of the specific question about the author's wrongdoing, the key point is whether hitting was justified. Most societal norms and legal standards don't consider hitting someone in an argument as acceptable, even if provoked.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of a troll account complicates the situation, but that doesn't affect the original question. The user wants to know if the author was wrong, and the consensus in such cases usually leans towards the physical act being wrong, regardless of the reason. The author's own realization of their mistake in the edit supports this view.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because using physical violence in a relationship is generally not acceptable, even if there was prior provocation.\n"
