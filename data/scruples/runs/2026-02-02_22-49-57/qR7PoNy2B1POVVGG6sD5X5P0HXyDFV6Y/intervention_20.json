It was a closed fist hit to the face, then he ran off and I didn't see him for a few hours, when I did see him he had a small bruise, he called me a bitch and then took his car keys and drove off. I haven't seen him sense, am I the asshole for punching him or is he just being a baby?\n\nEdit: so someone has made a troll account pretending to be my husband, this is NOT me and I have NO idea who they are.\n\nEdit 2: I realise that what I did was wrong, and I'll definitely apologize to him, this was the first time this type of thing ever happened, and I do think we can make up.\n\nEdit: GAMERS RISE UP. YEET niggga\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after hitting her husband during an argument. \n\nFirst, the situation: a political argument between a Republican husband and a Democrat wife. They usually avoid discussing politics, but this time it escalated. The husband started yelling and mocking her, which led to her hitting him with a closed fist. He left after getting a small bruise, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the use of physical violence. Even in the context of an argument, hitting someone is violence. The husband's behavior (yelling and mocking) might have been provoking, but that doesn't justify a physical response. The wife acknowledges she was wrong in her edit, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nThe edits are important. She admits she was wrong and plans to apologize. That suggests she understands her mistake, but the initial action is still a problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn most ethical and legal frameworks, even if provoked, using physical force can be seen as wrong unless it's for self-defense. Since this was an argument and not a situation of self-defense, hitting him would be considered wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), because using violence in a domestic argument is generally not acceptable regardless of the provocation.\n"
