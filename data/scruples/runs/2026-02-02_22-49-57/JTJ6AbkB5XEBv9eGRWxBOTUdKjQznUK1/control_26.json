I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the university's swimming coach.\n\nFirst, the sister was led to believe she was accepted into the university via the coach's email. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending the same message to both applicants and accepted students. This caused the sister significant emotional distress. The author, wanting to make the university accountable and raise awareness about such errors, shared the emails publicly.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the context. The coach's error caused real harm to the student-athlete's experience, which is a serious issue given the stress of college admissions. By publicizing the emails, the author is bringing attention to a systemic problem, potentially preventing similar incidents for others. However, there's also the consideration of privacy and the coach's right to correct their mistake, albeit poorly handled.\n\nBut the main factor is the intent. The author's goal was to highlight a mistake that caused harm, not to defame the coach or the university. Publicizing private communications can be a gray area, but in this case, it's framed as a call for accountability and awareness. The other students on the swim team might be biased in their criticism because they're defending their coach, not fully understanding the sister's experience.\n\nSo, while there's a debate about privacy versus accountability, the author's actions seem justified given the circumstances. The coach admitted fault, and the author is using this as a case to prevent future mistakes. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
