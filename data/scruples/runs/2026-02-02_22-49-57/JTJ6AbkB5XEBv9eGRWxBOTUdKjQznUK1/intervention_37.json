I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told she was accepted into her dream school by the coach, but it turns out it was a mistake. The family was upset, and the author shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, and some people, including students from the university, are criticizing the author for making the emails public.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for posting the emails. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the coach made a mistake that caused emotional distress to the sister. The author's intention was to shed light on the university's mistake and prevent it from happening to others. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a form of accountability, ensuring the university addresses the issue and possibly improving their processes. The coach's actions were negligent, and sharing the emails might be justified to inform others and hold the university responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, publishing private emails can be considered an invasion of privacy. The coach's personal or professional error might be a matter that should be handled privately between the parties involved. The public shaming could have repercussions on the coach's reputation and career, which might be an overstep if the intent was solely to help the sister. Also, the students on the team might feel that the author is attacking their coach without fully understanding the context, even if the coach was at fault.\n\nI need to consider the balance between accountability and privacy. The coach did admit fault, so the university might have internal processes to handle such mistakes. The author's action could be seen as necessary to prevent future errors, but it could also be seen as crossing a privacy line. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the sister. The emotional harm caused by the mistake is significant, and the author's public campaign might be a way to seek justice and support for their sister. However, using public shaming might not be the most effective or ethical approach. There's also the aspect of the university's responsibility to correct their miscommunication, and perhaps the author should have escalated the issue through appropriate channels first, like contacting admissions or the university's administration directly.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, sharing private correspondence without consent is generally frowned upon unless there's a public interest or to prevent harm. In this case, the public interest argument is that it's exposing a flaw in the admissions process that affects student-athletes. However, the emails might contain information that shouldn't be public, like personal details of other applicants or internal communications.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions could be seen as justified if the intent was to prevent future mistakes, but it's also possible that the author overstepped by not handling it through official channels first. The coach's apology and admission of fault might suggest that the university is aware, so publicizing it could be redundant or even harmful to the coach unjustly. \n\nI think the key factors are intent and the method used. If the author's goal was to protect their sister and others, but the method involved public shaming without exhausting other options, there might be some fault. However, given the emotional trauma involved, the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to a stressful situation. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance here. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because the coach made a significant mistake, but there's also a case to be made that the author could have handled it differently. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the emotional context, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
