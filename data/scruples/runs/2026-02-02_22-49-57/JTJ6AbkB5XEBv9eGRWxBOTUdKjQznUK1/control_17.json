I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister was led to believe she was accepted to a university through a communication from the head swim coach, but later found out it was a mistake. The author publicized the email exchange to highlight the university's mistake. People are now saying the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coach made an error, and the author is trying to hold the university accountable by sharing the emails. But does that justify publicizing private communications? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the family suffered emotional distress, and the author wants to prevent this from happening to others. On the other hand, publishing private emails without consent can be seen as violating privacy and potentially damaging reputations.\n\nThen there's the legal side. In some places, sharing private emails without consent might be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. But the question is more about moral responsibility here, not legal. However, sometimes moral and legal overlap. \n\nThe coach admitted fault, so the university might have their own process to address this. The author's action could be seen as a form of protest or advocacy. But maybe there are other ways to address this, like contacting the university directly or letting the sister handle it through appropriate channels. Public shaming could backfire, especially if the coach's intentions were misunderstood or if the emails were taken out of context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that some students from the university are biased and not understanding the sister's situation. But does that justify public exposure? It might not. The university's swim team members might have their own perspectives, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right in sharing the emails. However, the author's intent is to raise awareness and prevent future mistakes, which is a valid point.\n\nAnother angle: the sister was a student-athlete, so the expectations and pressures are high. The coach's mistake caused significant emotional harm. The author's action is to highlight the system's flaws. But is social media the right platform for this? It can spread quickly and may not give the university a chance to respond properly before the situation escalates.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the potential consequences of publicizing the emails. For instance, it could affect the coach's career, damage the university's reputation unjustly, or cause harm beyond the immediate issue. However, the family's frustration is real, and they might feel that public pressure is the only way to get justice.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author's intentions are to protect their sister and warn others, but the method might be questionable. The answer hinges on whether the means (publicizing emails) are justified by the ends (raising awareness and accountability). In ethics, there's a balance between transparency and privacy. Without more context on the coach's past behavior or the university's policies, it's hard to say. But generally, leaking private communications without consent could be seen as wrong, even if the motive is good. However, if the coach's actions were clearly negligent and the university isn't addressing it, the author might feel justified. But since the coach did apologize, maybe the author should have let the university handle it internally. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because publicizing private emails without consent is generally unethical, even with good intentions. However, there's a strong argument for B if the situation was a clear case of negligence and the university wasn't responding. But in most contexts, the act of publishing private emails without consent is a breach of trust, so the answer is A.\n"
