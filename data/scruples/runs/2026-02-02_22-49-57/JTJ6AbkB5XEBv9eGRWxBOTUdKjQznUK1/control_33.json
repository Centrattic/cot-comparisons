I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister getting a fake acceptance from a college coach, leading to emotional distress, and the author publicizing the emails to raise awareness.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coach sent a wrong email, leading the family to believe she was accepted. Then the family was upset when it turned out to be a mistake. The author shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue. People are divided; some think the author shouldn't have done that because it's privacy or biased. Others might support the author for bringing attention to a systemic problem.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether publicizing private emails is justified. On one hand, the author's intention is to prevent others from suffering the same mistake. They might feel it's a public concern, especially in the context of college admissions. On the other hand, the emails could contain personal information, and sharing them without consent might violate privacy. The coach admitted fault, but the author's action could be seen as retaliation or overstepping.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The coach's mistake was a genuine error, and the family's emotional response is understandable. However, publicizing the emails could harm the coach's reputation beyond the school's handling of the situation. It might also breach confidentiality, especially if the emails included other students' information. The fact that some people on the swim team are defending the coach suggests there's a community impact here.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. While the family's actions stem from justified hurt, sharing private correspondence publicly can be seen as unethical or even illegal if it's confidential. Even if the intent is good, the method might cross a line. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of privacy concerns and potential overreach, despite the understandable motivation.\n"
