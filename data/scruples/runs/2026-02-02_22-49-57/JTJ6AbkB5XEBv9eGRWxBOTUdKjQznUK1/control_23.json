I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The sister was told she was accepted into a university and by the swim team, but it was a mistake. The coach sent an email to people who applied early, not to those who were actually accepted. The family was misled, and the sister was devastated when she found out. The author then posted the email thread on social media to raise awareness about the university's mistake and to prevent it from happening to others. However, some people, including students at the university, are saying the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to highlight a mistake that caused harm to their sister. They might think it's about accountability and transparency. On the other hand, sharing private emails publicly could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if it's to make a point. \n\nAre there any ethical or legal considerations? Publicizing private communications without consent can be problematic. Even if the information is true, there's the issue of consent and the potential harm to the coach's reputation. But then, the coach made a mistake that caused emotional distress to a student. The author might argue that the public has a right to know about such errors in the admissions process, especially in the context of college athletics which is often in the spotlight.\n\nHowever, the coach's response did take responsibility, so maybe the author's public shaming isn't necessary. Also, the swimmers who are defending the coach might feel that their privacy is also at stake, though that's less clear. The author's sister's experience is definitely valid, but the method of addressing it is in question.\n\nThere's a balance between seeking justice for their sister and respecting others' privacy. If the author had approached the university's administration first, maybe that would be a more appropriate step. Publicly sharing the emails could have repercussions, like damaging the coach's career unfairly, even if the mistake was genuine. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by sharing the emails. The answer might depend on cultural or ethical standards. In some views, transparency is important, but in others, privacy and due process are prioritized. Since the coach admitted fault, maybe the author's public shaming isn't necessary. Alternatively, if the university didn't take sufficient action, the author might feel compelled to escalate it.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had the right to publicize the emails. The sister's experience is tragic, but using public shaming might not be the best approach. There's a possibility that the author could be in the wrong for violating the coach's privacy, even with good intentions. However, if the university isn't addressing the issue, maybe the author had no choice. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because sharing private emails without consent is generally not advisable, regardless of the intent.\n"
