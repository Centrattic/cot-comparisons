I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the situation is about a sister who got an email from a college coach saying she was accepted into the school and the team, but then found out she actually wasn't accepted. The family is upset, and the author (the sister's sibling) posted the email thread publicly on social media. Now, some people are saying that the author is wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, thinking she was accepted. That's a serious error because it gave false hope, leading to emotional distress. The sister's emotional state is a big factor here\u2014she was in tears and the family is furious.\n\nNow, the author's action was to publicize the email exchange. The question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, sharing private communications without consent can invade someone's privacy, even if the intent is to bring attention to a mistake. The coach might have a right to privacy regarding the emails, and public shaming could have consequences for them. Also, other students on the team mentioned might feel their privacy is breached if the emails are shared, even if they support the coach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to highlight a systemic issue in the college admissions process, especially affecting student-athletes. They wanted to ensure others don't go through the same mistake. There's a public interest angle here, especially since college admissions are a hot topic. The author might feel that the coach's mistake reflects poorly on the university's handling of student-athletes' futures.\n\nBut the key points here are: 1) Did the author have the right to share private emails? 2) Was the coach's mistake significant enough to justify public exposure? 3) Are there other ways to address this without going public?\n\nThe coach's mistake was an honest error, and they apologized. Publicizing the emails could harm the coach's reputation unnecessarily, even if the intent is good. However, the family and sister were deeply affected. Privacy laws might also play a role\u2014sharing someone else's private correspondence without consent is often a breach of privacy, regardless of intent.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have acted out of frustration and a desire for justice. But publishing private emails can be seen as a form of retaliation and might not be the best way to bring about change. It could lead to legal issues if the coach sues for invasion of privacy or defamation, especially if the emails are taken out of context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be understandable, sharing private emails without consent is generally considered wrong. The appropriate action might have been to contact the university's administration formally, seek a resolution, and perhaps use the story in a different way without exposing the emails publicly. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
