I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a younger sister getting an email from a college swimming coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The author shared the emails publicly on social media to highlight the university's mistake, but some people, especially current students on the swim team, are upset and say it's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone else's private emails without their consent. Even if the intent is to expose a mistake, privacy is a big deal. The coach might have sent the email in error, but the family's reaction is understandable. The sister was genuinely upset, and the family is trying to make their disappointment known. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author had the right to publicize the emails. The coach's email was sent to the sister, so it's a private conversation. The author and family might have felt betrayed or frustrated, but putting the emails online without the sister's permission could be a breach of her privacy. Even if they got her consent, the coach might not have intended for the emails to be public. \n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, acknowledging the mistake. The author's action could be seen as punitive, even if the coach made a mistake. However, the family's emotional state and the stress of the college admissions process add context. They might feel that the university isn't being transparent or responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the swimmers on the team are defending the coach, which could be because they don't want their own recruitment process to be affected if the coach is seen as untrustworthy. But that doesn't necessarily make the author right. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might hinge on the act of sharing private emails without consent. Even with good intentions, that's a gray area. If the author shared it without the sister's permission, that could be problematic. If they did get permission, maybe it's more justified. But the story doesn't mention that. The family's reaction is fury, but the author's action is about publicizing the emails. \n\nI think the author's main issue is the public sharing of the emails. While the coach's mistake was inconsiderate and hurtful, the author's response might have crossed a line into exposing private communications, which can be seen as unethical regardless of intent. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
