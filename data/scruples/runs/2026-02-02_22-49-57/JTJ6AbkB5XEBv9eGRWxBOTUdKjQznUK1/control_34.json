I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister got an email from the head swim coach at her dream school saying she was accepted and invited to join the team. The family got excited, but then the sister wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake of sending the email to someone who hadn't been accepted. The author then posted the email thread publicly on social media to make people aware of how bad the university is being, but some people, especially students there, are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to highlight a mistake that caused harm to their sister, right? The coach made an error, which led to emotional distress. By publicizing the emails, the author is trying to hold the university accountable and prevent similar issues for others. But on the other hand, releasing private emails could be a privacy violation. The coach and the university might have policies about communication with applicants, and the author's action might breach confidentiality or trust.\n\nAlso, the other students, especially those on the swim team, are defending the coach and say the author is wrong to publicize it. They might feel that their coach is being unfairly targeted, or they might not want the school's reputation damaged. However, the author's sister was wronged, so is the author justified in bringing attention to it?\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. If the author's post goes viral, it could damage the university's reputation, the coach's career, and maybe even the students who are now defending the coach. But the sister's emotional harm is also significant. The author's action is a form of public shaming, which is sometimes used to hold institutions accountable, but it can be controversial.\n\nIs there a better way the author could have handled it? Maybe contacting the university administration directly to address the issue, or reporting the error through proper channels. Publicizing the emails might be seen as an overreaction, especially if the author didn't give the university a chance to respond before going public. However, the family was already in contact with the coach and the university, and maybe they felt that wasn't enough.\n\nAlso, the emails might be considered private correspondence. Sharing them without permission could be a breach of privacy for all parties involved, not just the coach. The sister's emails are part of the thread, so sharing them could expose her personal information and her distress publicly, which might not be fair to her either.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to sacrifice someone else's privacy to make a point? The author's intentions are good, but the method might be problematic. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to prevent future harm, but the method could be questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions could be seen as wrong because they shared private emails publicly, which invades the privacy of the coach and possibly the sister, and might be an excessive response. However, the motivation is to highlight a legitimate mistake that caused harm. But given that there are other ways to address the issue without public shaming, the author might be in the wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
