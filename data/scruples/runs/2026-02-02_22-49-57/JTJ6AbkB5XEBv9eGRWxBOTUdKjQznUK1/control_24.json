I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who shared their sister's email exchange with the coach is in the wrong. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted into the university, which she wasn't. The sister was devastated, and the author posted the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coach made a mistake, which is unfortunate, but the author's response was to publicize the emails. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the sister went through a lot of emotional distress because of the coach's error. The author's intention was to make the university accountable and prevent others from similar experiences. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a form of holding the coach and university responsible, especially since the coach's mistake had significant consequences for the student.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private communications without consent could be a privacy issue. The coach might argue that the emails were meant to be confidential, and the author's action could be seen as violating that trust. Also, the coach did apologize, which might suggest that the matter was personal and not meant for public scrutiny.\n\nThere's also the perspective of the university's reputation. If the author's post causes reputational damage, the university might retaliate or the coach could face personal repercussions. However, the sister's emotional harm is a valid concern, and the public might sympathize with her plight.\n\nAnother angle is the potential backlash against the author. The swimmers mentioned are part of the swim team and might feel that their community is being targeted. They could have their own reasons for not wanting the story to go public, even if they feel bad for the sister. But the author's argument is that the swimmers are biased towards their coach.\n\nLegally, sharing emails without consent could be an issue. However, in the context of a public forum like social media, the legality might depend on whether the emails were obtained ethically. Since the author received the emails as part of the sister's account, there might not be a legal barrier, but ethical considerations remain.\n\nConsidering all these points, the main conflict is between accountability and privacy. The author's action is a form of public shaming, which can be effective but is also controversial. Whether it's justified depends on the severity of the harm caused by the coach's mistake versus the harm caused by publicizing the emails.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are understandable, publicizing the emails might cross ethical boundaries by exposing the coach's mistake publicly without giving him a chance to address it privately. The sister's distress is valid, but the method of addressing it through public exposure might be seen as the author's wrongdoing. Hence, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong). However, if the publicizing was necessary to prevent future mistakes, it might be seen as justified (B). The balance here is tricky, but the ethical breach in sharing private emails might tip the scale towards A.\n"
