I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The sister was told by the coach she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, mixing up Early Action applicants with accepted students. The author posted the email thread online to raise awareness and hold the university accountable, but some people, including current swimmers, are upset and say it's wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, the author's sister was wronged by a miscommunication that caused emotional harm. The coach's mistake led to false hope, and the family wanted to ensure others don't go through the same. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a way to expose the error and prevent future issues, especially since the admissions process is under scrutiny.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails publicly without consent might invade the coach's privacy and could be considered a breach of confidentiality, even if the intent was good. The coach did apologize, so the issue might have been resolved privately. The author's action could damage the coach's reputation beyond what's necessary, even if it's justified as a lesson.\n\nLegal considerations: In some places, sharing someone's private emails could lead to legal consequences if it's deemed defamation or invasion of privacy, unless it's for a legitimate purpose like public interest. However, since the author is sharing their personal story, it might fall under protected speech, especially if the intent is to inform the public about a mistake in the admissions process.\n\nEthically, the debate is between the right to privacy and the right to expose wrongdoing. The author's actions aim to highlight a systemic issue (errors in admissions) and support their sister. However, the coach's error was acknowledged, and the family had already engaged with the coach directly. Public exposure might be seen as unnecessary escalation.\n\nAlso, the swimmers' reactions suggest that the author's actions could have broader consequences, like affecting current students or the coach's career, which might be disproportionate to the mistake.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author's intent was protective and to prevent similar situations, but the method of public shaming might cross ethical lines. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the potential for overstepping by sharing private communications publicly, even with good intentions. However, if the public disclosure serves a public interest in holding institutions accountable, it might be justified. This is a tough call, but leaning towards A because of the ethical implications of sharing private emails without consent.\n"
