  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for publicizing the emails between my younger sister and the head swimming coach of her dream school?\nMy younger sister is a senior in high school who has been applying for college and also a competitive swimmer.\n\nWhile my sister was applying for the first choice university, the head swimming coach of the school emailed her and said the following:\n\n&gt; I hope this email finds you well and enjoying a Happy New Year! I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their younger sister getting an email from a coach saying she was accepted to a university, but then finding out she wasn't. The author publicized the email thread to highlight the issue, and now some people are saying they're wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach accidentally sent an acceptance email to the sister, which was a mix-up with Early Action applicants. The coach admitted the error and apologized. But the sister was left in a really bad place emotionally, leading to tears and distress. The family is upset because the coach's mistake caused false hope.\n\nThe author's action was to put the email screenshots on social media. The question is whether this was wrong. On one hand, the author might be trying to hold the university accountable and prevent similar mistakes for others. Publicizing the emails could raise awareness about the admissions process's flaws, especially since college admissions are in the news. It's a way to support their sister and others by showing the risks of such errors.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a privacy issue. The coach might have personal or professional privacy, and the author's action could damage the coach's reputation or lead to repercussions. Also, the current students on the swim team argue that the author's public shaming is unfair, possibly because they are defending the coach and don't want the story to harm the team's reputation.\n\nBut considering the emotional harm done to the sister, the author might feel it's justified to expose the mistake. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent, proportionality of the response, and whether there are other ways to address the issue.\n\nThe author's intent seems to be to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same situation. However, public shaming via social media might not be the most effective or ethical approach. They could have addressed it through the university's channels, like filing a complaint or contacting admissions. Publicizing private emails could be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if the intention is good.\n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, and the university might have policies to handle such mistakes. The author's action might escalate the situation unnecessarily, causing further distress to the coach and the university, and possibly harming the sister's chances if the university is embarrassed. The other students' reactions suggest that the community might see the author's actions as overstepping, especially if they are defending their coach.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are understandable, using social media to expose the emails could breach privacy and be considered an overreaction. There might be other ways to seek accountability without public shaming. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
