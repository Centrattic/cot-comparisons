I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe sister is a senior applying to college and a competitive swimmer. The coach emailed her, congratulating her on being accepted and inviting her to join the team. The family got excited, but then the sister wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted to sending the email by mistake, confusing her with others who had been accepted. The author took screenshots of the email thread and posted them publicly on social media to highlight the issue and prevent it from happening to others. Now, some people, including current students on the team, are saying the author is wrong to do that, claiming bias towards the coach.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions taken. The author is sharing private communications publicly. Even though the intent is to expose a mistake that caused their sister harm, releasing someone's emails without consent typically violates privacy. The coach might have made a mistake, but does that justify sharing the emails? Also, the coach's explanation is that it was an error, which they apologized for. The author's action could be seen as adding insult to injury, even if the coach was at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister was deeply hurt by the mistake, and the family felt the issue wasn't adequately addressed. The author's motivation was to raise awareness and prevent similar situations. However, public shaming or exposing private communications can have consequences, possibly damaging the coach's reputation beyond what's necessary. There might be a better way to address the issue, like contacting the university administration or media, without releasing personal emails.\n\nThe key points here are the violation of privacy versus the intent to seek justice. While the coach's mistake was significant, the author's method of addressing it could be problematic. Publicizing the emails could be considered an invasion of privacy, even if the coach made the error. Additionally, the author might not have considered the coach's perspective or the potential for misinterpretation of the emails out of context.\n\nIn some cases, exposing wrongdoing is justified, but this situation is about a mistake rather than malicious intent. The coach did apologize, so the author's public exposure might be excessive. The family's anger is justified, but using social media to share private emails might not be the appropriate response. It's possible that the university could take action without the public needing the specific emails. The author could have sought to address the issue internally before going public.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the coach made a mistake, the author's action of publicly sharing the emails might be in the wrong because it breaches privacy and could be seen as retaliatory beyond the appropriate response. However, there's a strong argument for transparency in the admissions process. But the method chosen might not be the best approach. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a tough call.\n"
