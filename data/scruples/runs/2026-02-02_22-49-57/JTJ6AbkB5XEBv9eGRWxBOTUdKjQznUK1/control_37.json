I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about their younger sister getting a fake acceptance email from a swimming coach at her dream school. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, and the family was really upset. The author then posted the email thread on social media to publicize the issue. Now others are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points here. The coach made a mistake, which caused emotional distress to the sister. The family is angry, and the author took screenshots and shared them publicly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the family was wronged, and they might feel that sharing the emails helps bring attention to the issue and prevent it from happening to others. The author's intention was to highlight the mistake and protect other student-athletes. But on the other hand, publishing private emails without the consent of the parties involved could be seen as a violation of privacy. The coach might have a right to privacy, and sharing the emails could damage their reputation, even if the intent was to expose a mistake.\n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, so maybe the author could have handled it through other means, like contacting the university's administration or media outlets in a more controlled way. However, the family's emotional state might have led them to take a more direct approach. The fact that some people, especially students at the university, are upset suggests that publicizing the emails might have caused additional harm or unfair judgment against the coach.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's action was a form of vigilantism. Instead of letting the university handle it internally, they took matters into their own hands. If the university didn't address the issue adequately, maybe sharing the emails was a way to hold them accountable. But if the emails were shared without considering the consequences, like potential legal issues or invasion of privacy, that could be problematic.\n\nI should also think about the emotional impact. The sister was really hurt, and the family wants justice. But does public shaming or exposing private communications serve that purpose, or does it cross a line? There's a balance between defending one's family and respecting others' privacy.\n\nIn some cases, sharing such emails could be protected under free speech, especially if it's to inform the public about a mistake that affects others. However, there's a risk of defamation if the content is taken out of context, even if the coach did make a mistake. The author might have a valid point about the need for transparency, but the method might be questionable.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the intent was to prevent future harm and support their sister, which is understandable. However, the method involved publicizing private communications, which could be seen as crossing a line. The coach's apology and the potential for privacy violations might mean that the author is in the wrong. But others might argue that the family's right to defend their daughter is justified. \n\nI think it's a close call, but the general consensus in such situations often leans towards not publicizing private emails without consent, regardless of the intent. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
