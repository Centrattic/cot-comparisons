I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for publicizing the email thread between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university and made part of the swim team, but it turned out to be a mistake. The coach sent the wrong email, confusing applicants with accepted students. The family was thrilled, then devastated when the acceptance didn't come through. The author took screenshots and posted them online to expose the university's mistake, arguing that it shouldn't happen to other students.\n\nThe key points here are the coach's error and the family's reaction. The coach admitted fault, so the university made a mistake. The author's action was to publicize the emails, which the coach and some students (including team members) are now criticizing. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that the university's error caused significant distress, and by sharing the emails, they're holding the institution accountable. They might feel it's justified to spread the story to prevent similar issues for others. On the other hand, sharing confidential communications without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent was good. The coach's mistake was a miscommunication, but the author's public exposure could have consequences beyond just the sister's experience, like damaging the coach's reputation or the university's image.\n\nBut the coach did admit fault, so maybe the university is aware and taking steps to prevent this. However, the author's action might be considered an overreaction. Publicizing private emails can lead to public shaming or legal issues. The sister's experience is valid, but airing it publicly might not be the best approach. Also, the fact that current students are defending the coach might indicate that they feel the author's exposure is unfair, even if they sympathize with the sister.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between accountability and privacy. While the author's intentions are to prevent future mistakes, the method of using screenshots on social media could be seen as inappropriate. The author might have other avenues to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration or media, rather than public shaming. Therefore, the action of publicizing the emails without consent could be considered wrong, even if the situation is frustrating.\n"
