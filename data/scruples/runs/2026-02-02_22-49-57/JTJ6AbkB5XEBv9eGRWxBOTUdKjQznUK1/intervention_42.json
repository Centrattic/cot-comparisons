I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for posting the email thread between their sister and the coach publicly. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family was devastated, so the author shared the emails to highlight the issue and get support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Publicizing someone's private emails without consent is generally a big no-no. Even if the intention is good, like exposing a mistake or injustice, sharing personal communication can invade privacy and potentially damage reputations. The coach might have made an error, but the author's action could be seen as retaliatory or using public shaming.\n\nThen there's the perspective of the sister's experience. The family's frustration is understandable; the emotional impact on the sister is significant. However, by sharing the emails, the author might be crossing a line by exposing the coach and possibly the university. The coach did apologize, so maybe the appropriate step was to address it privately or through official channels rather than public social media.\n\nAlso, the other students (current swimmers) are upset because the author is publicizing the emails, which could affect the coach's reputation or their own standing. The author's justification is that they want to prevent others from going through the same issue, but there might be other ways to advocate for change without breaching privacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. While the intent was to bring attention to the problem, the method involved publishing private correspondence. There's a balance between accountability and respecting privacy. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, but the author's response might not be the most ethical approach. Public shaming can sometimes lead to more harm than good, even with good intentions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions, though driven by a desire to support their sister and highlight a problem, may have been an invasion of privacy. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information publicly without considering the privacy of the individuals involved.\n"
