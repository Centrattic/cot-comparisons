I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sharing the email thread between their sister and the swim coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university, which turned out to be a mistake. The family is upset, and the author shared the emails on social media to highlight the university's mistake. Now others are saying the author is wrong to do that, especially current students and swimmers who might be biased towards the coach.\n\nThe key issues here are privacy and intent. The author's sister had a private conversation with the coach, which was then made public. Even though the situation is unfortunate, sharing private emails without the consent of the parties involved can be a breach of privacy. The coach might have made a mistake, but the author's response is to expose this publicly. \n\nThen there's the question of whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, they want to bring attention to the university's error and prevent it from happening to others. On the other hand, by sharing the emails, they might be violating the sister's privacy or the coach's, even if the intention was good. \n\nAlso, considering the impact on the coach's reputation. Even if the coach erred, public shaming or exposing private communication could be seen as harsh. The family's anger is valid, but the author's method of addressing it might cross a line.\n\nI should also think about the legal aspect. In some places, releasing private emails without consent could have legal repercussions, though that's not the main point here. Ethically, it's about whether the ends justify the means. \n\nThe author's justification is to make the university accountable and to warn others. But others, including the swimmers, argue that this is not the right approach. They might feel that the author is overstepping, especially if the emails contain sensitive information or if the coach is being unfairly targeted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is unfortunate and the coach's mistake was inconsiderate, the author's action of publicizing the emails without consent may indeed be in the wrong. The right approach might have been to address the issue through proper channels rather than social media. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
