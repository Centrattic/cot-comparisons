I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the post is in the wrong for publicizing the email thread between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach she was accepted to the university, which led to a lot of excitement. Then it turned out to be a mistake. The author put the emails online to highlight the university's mistake and to make sure others don't go through the same thing. But some people, especially current students on the swim team, are upset and say the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nNow, the key points here are the coach's mistake and the author's response. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, mixing up applicants and accepted students. That's a serious error, especially in college admissions where a lot is at stake. The author's sister was deeply affected, leading to emotional distress. \n\nThe author's action was to publicize the emails. The question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the author is trying to hold the university accountable and prevent others from being in the same situation. On the other hand, releasing emails might infringe on privacy or be considered defamation if not done carefully. \n\nBut in this case, the author is sharing factual emails that the coach sent. The coach's admission of error is in the emails, so there's no fabrication. The author's intent is to shed light on a mistake and support their sister. Publicizing the emails as evidence could be seen as a form of seeking justice, especially if the university isn't taking responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's a line between advocacy and invasion of privacy. If the emails contain personal information beyond the mistake, that might be an issue. But given the context, the author's action seems to be in good faith. The people opposing them are current students who might be protecting the coach or their university. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact on the sister, the author's action is an attempt to address the harm caused by the coach's error. It's a way to amplify the sister's voice when the university might not be listening. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the emails were shared truthfully and without malicious intent, then the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
