I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for sharing the email correspondence between their sister and the coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university and the swim team, which made the family and her really excited. But then it turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, mixing up those who applied early with those accepted. The author took screenshots and put them on social media to publicize the mistake and show why they're upset. Some people, including current team members, are saying the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The coach made a mistake, which was clearly a big deal because it caused emotional distress to the sister. The author's action was to publicize the emails to bring attention to the issue. The coach's explanation was that it was an error in communication, but maybe the way he handled it wasn't the best. \n\nI need to consider the implications of sharing private emails without permission. Even if the intention is to highlight a mistake, sharing someone's private communications can be a breach of privacy, especially if it's done publicly. However, the context here is that the mistake directly affected their family, and the author felt the need to share it to prevent others from going through the same situation. \n\nAlso, the coach's actions, while a mistake, were in a position of authority. The coach's email might have been misleading, even if it was an error. The author's action could be seen as a form of exposing a systemic issue in college admissions, particularly for student-athletes. \n\nBut on the other hand, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic. It might be considered an invasion of privacy for both the coach and the sister. However, the sister is the one who was wronged here, so maybe the emails are relevant. \n\nAnother angle: the coach's apology mentions that it was an error, but the way he explained it might not fully address the emotional impact. The author's motivation is to highlight the university's mistake and prevent similar issues. But does that justify publicizing the emails?\n\nI need to weigh the right to privacy against the public interest in exposing a mistake that affects students. If the author's intent is to inform others and hold the university accountable, it might be seen as justified. However, if it's done without considering the privacy of the individuals involved, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn some cases, public shaming or exposing mistakes can be a way to bring attention to systemic issues, but it's a thin line. The key points are the coach's error, the emotional impact on the sister, and the author's intent to prevent future harm. The response from others, like current team members, might be biased as they defend the coach, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because their action was in response to a significant mistake that caused harm and they aimed to prevent similar situations. However, there's a gray area regarding privacy. But given the context, the author's intent seems protective and corrective rather than malicious.\n"
