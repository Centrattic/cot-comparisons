I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a younger sister who got falsely told by a swim coach that she was accepted to their university. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, and the family was really upset. The author shared the emails publicly on social media to bring attention to the issue, but some people, especially current students and swimmers, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author (the person who shared the emails) is in the wrong. Let's break down the elements here. The coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually admitted. The family was misled and the sister was emotionally affected. The author's response was to publicize the email exchange, arguing that the university should be held accountable and to prevent similar situations for other student-athletes.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are: Is publicizing private emails without consent a breach of privacy? Even if the intent is to expose a mistake, sharing emails can be seen as a violation of the coach's privacy. Also, could this action have negative consequences beyond the intended purpose? For example, it might damage the coach's reputation or the university's, but the coach did admit fault. However, the author might not have considered that the coach's error was unintentional and that public shaming could be excessive. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's emotional distress is valid, but the solution the author chose might not be the most appropriate. The author might have a right to be upset, but sharing private communications without consent could lead to other issues, like legal concerns about defamation or privacy. The people who are upset about the public sharing might be defending the coach, but their bias is understandable if they are part of the university community. \n\nOn the other hand, the coach's mistake was significant and caused real harm. The author's intention was to hold the university accountable, which is a valid concern. However, the method of taking screenshots and posting them publicly might not be the correct way to address the issue. The family could have addressed the matter through official channels or sought media attention through proper means instead of directly leaking private emails.\n\nIn some cases, sharing such information can backfire or not lead to the intended change. It's a balance between accountability and respecting privacy. The author might argue that the ends justify the means, but the act of publicizing private emails without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the intent. Therefore, the answer might be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
