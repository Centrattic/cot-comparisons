I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong for sharing the emails between their sister and the coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was mistakenly told by the coach that she was accepted into the university, which led to her being overjoyed, and then later finding out she wasn't. The author took screenshots of the email exchange and posted them publicly to highlight the university's mistake and how it affected their sister. Some people, including current students on the swim team, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author overstep by publicizing the emails?\n\nI should consider a few factors here. First, the coach's mistake was a genuine error\u2014he emailed the wrong person, confusing someone who applied with those who were accepted. The coach apologized, so there's an admission of fault. However, the sister was emotionally affected, which is valid.\n\nNow, the author's action was sharing the emails publicly. That could be seen as exposing private communication. Even if the intention was to raise awareness, sharing someone's emails without consent can be a breach of privacy. The coach and the sister might not have intended for those emails to be public. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's motivation was to hold the university accountable and prevent similar situations. The public might sympathize with the sister's plight. However, there's a balance between advocacy and privacy. The author might have a valid point in wanting to bring attention to the issue, but using the actual emails could be seen as violating privacy, especially if the sister's identity is revealed.\n\nAlso, the swimmers who are defending the coach might have their own reasons, but the author's action isn't necessarily about the coach's reputation but about the sister's experience. Still, releasing private emails can have repercussions beyond the immediate issue, potentially harming the coach's career or the university's reputation beyond what's necessary.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the permission of their sister to share the emails? If the sister agreed, it might be different. But if they acted unilaterally, that could be a problem. The scenario doesn't mention consent, so assuming they didn't ask, that's a potential issue.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while the intent was to raise awareness, the method of using the emails publicly could be seen as a violation of privacy. There might be other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university directly or sharing the story without the specific emails. \n\nHowever, given the emotional distress the sister went through, some might argue that the author had a right to expose the mistake to prevent others from suffering the same. But again, the line between advocacy and invasion of privacy is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all this, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong for publishing the emails without consent, despite the good intentions. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
