I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister was led to believe she was accepted into her dream university because the head swim coach sent an email congratulating her, even though she hadn't actually been accepted yet. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending the wrong email. The author then publicized the email thread on social media to raise awareness about the university's error and to prevent others from going through the same thing. However, some people, especially students from the university's swim team, are upset about the public exposure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coach made a mistake, which caused significant emotional distress to the sister. The coach took responsibility, apologized, and explained that it was an error in communications. The author's actions were to share the emails publicly, which can be seen as an attempt to hold the university accountable and to support their sister's emotional and mental well-being by getting the university to recognize the mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the coach's privacy and the potential impact on their reputation might be factors. However, the coach admitted fault, so the information is already out in the public eye through the sister's experience. The key points here are the intent behind the author's actions. Were they trying to embarrass the coach unnecessarily, or were they seeking justice and preventing similar incidents? \n\nPublicizing the emails could also be seen as a form of whistleblowing, exposing a systemic issue in the admissions process. However, it's important to consider if there were other avenues to address this before going public. For example, did the family try to get a formal apology or some form of compensation from the university? If not, maybe the author could have pursued those before going public. But given the emotional toll on the sister, and the coach's admission of fault, the author might feel that public exposure is necessary.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the author's actions to affect the coach unfairly, but since the coach admitted to the mistake, the author is not fabricating the situation. The author is highlighting a real mistake that had real consequences. Also, the coach's role in misleading a student about their acceptance is a valid concern for accountability.\n\nIn terms of the law, sharing emails could have privacy implications, but since the coach sent the emails and then admitted to the mistake, it's possible that the author is within their rights to share them, especially if it's for public interest. However, this might depend on the specific privacy laws in their location.\n\nThe other people's opinions, like the university students, argue that the author is wrong to publicize the emails. They might feel that the author is spreading negative information without considering the coach's position. But considering the emotional harm done to the sister, the public might also support the author's right to bring attention to the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent was to seek justice and raise awareness, and the coach's mistake was admitted. The emotional impact on the sister is significant, and the author's actions could be seen as justified. However, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. But given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
