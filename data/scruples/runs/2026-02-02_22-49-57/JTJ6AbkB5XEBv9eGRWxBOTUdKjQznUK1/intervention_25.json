I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister was led to believe she was accepted into the university through a coach's email, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach later admitted to sending the wrong email. The family was devastated, and the author decided to publicize the emails to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same experience.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the coach's error significant enough to warrant public exposure? The author's intention was to raise awareness and hold the university accountable. However, releasing the emails could be seen as a privacy invasion for the coach and possibly the university. But the sister's emotional distress is also a factor. \n\nEthically, the coach made a professional mistake that had real consequences. The author's action could serve as a warning to others about similar situations. However, publicizing personal communications without consent might have legal implications, like privacy violations or defamation if the coach were to sue. \n\nBut the user argues the author isn't in the wrong because the intent was to expose a mistake that harmed their sister. The coach's own admission of the error might support the author's stance. On the other hand, the university and coach might argue that the mistake was honest and that public shaming is unwarranted. \n\nI should also consider if the emails contain any sensitive information beyond just the error. If they do, sharing them could breach confidentiality. However, if the emails are straightforward and the coach admitted fault, the author's action is more about accountability. \n\nIn the end, it's a balance between accountability and privacy. The sister's emotional impact is significant, but the author's public exposure could have repercussions. However, given the coach's own admission and the intention to prevent similar issues, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
