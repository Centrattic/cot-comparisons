I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author, who is the sister's sibling, is in the wrong for posting the email thread between their sister and the head swimming coach publicly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was applying to her dream school, and the coach mistakenly told her she was accepted when she wasn't. The family was excited, and then it turned out to be a mistake. The author took screenshots of the email exchange and put them on social media to show how the university messed up, to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same thing. However, some people, including current students on the swim team, are upset that the author did this, saying it's wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The coach made a mistake, but does that justify publicly sharing private communications? On one hand, the author's intention is to hold the university accountable and warn others. On the other hand, sharing private emails without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the coach made a mistake, the author didn't get permission from the coach or the sister to post those emails. Also, the sister might have personal information that's now public. \n\nAnother angle: the sister's emotional distress is significant. The family is trying to bring attention to the issue. But using public shaming or exposing private emails could be counterproductive. It might damage the coach's reputation unfairly if the mistake was unintentional. Also, the current students might be defending the coach because they interact with him, so their perspective is biased.\n\nIs there a better way to address this? The family could have taken it up with the university's administration, maybe filed a complaint, or sought media attention through proper channels instead of social media. Posting publicly might be a form of vigilantism. However, the author's goal is valid\u2014to prevent such errors. But the method involves sharing private information, which raises privacy concerns.\n\nAlso, the coach did apologize and took responsibility. The author's action could be seen as public exposure without giving the coach a chance to address it privately. Maybe the family could have handled it through official channels first rather than social media. \n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy and consent are important. Even if the intention is good, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to raise awareness, but the method could be questionable. So, there's a conflict between transparency/accountability and respecting privacy. \n\nIn some cases, exposing wrongdoing is justified, but it's a gray area. The key factors are: the coach's mistake, the family's distress, the public's right to know about potential issues in admissions, and the privacy of the emails. \n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether the author shared the emails in a way that was necessary to expose the mistake. If the university didn't address it, maybe the author had reason to speak out. But if the author bypassed proper channels, that could be an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intention is to highlight a legitimate issue that caused harm, and sometimes public pressure is needed. However, there's a valid argument that sharing private communications without consent is wrong. But given the circumstances, the author's actions might be justified as a means to an end.\n"
