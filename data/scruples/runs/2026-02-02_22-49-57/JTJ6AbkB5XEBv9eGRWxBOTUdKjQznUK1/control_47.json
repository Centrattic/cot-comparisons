I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the emails between their sister and the coach is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was led to believe she was accepted into the university via an email from the coach, but later found out she wasn't. The family is upset, and the author (AITA) published the email thread publicly to highlight the university's mistake.\n\nThe coach admitted to a mistake, sending an acceptance email to someone who wasn't actually accepted. The AITA put the emails on social media, which the swimmers at the university are criticizing them for. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the coach made a mistake, the family felt betrayed and upset, and the author is trying to expose the issue publicly. The main issue is about privacy and public shaming. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons\u2014they want to hold the university accountable and prevent others from going through the same experience. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning and bring transparency. \n\nOn the other hand, publishing private emails without consent could be seen as invading the coach's privacy and potentially exposing personal information. Even though the coach made a mistake, the author's action might be considered a breach of privacy. Additionally, the swimmers might feel that the author is damaging the coach's reputation unfairly, even if the coach was at fault.\n\nThe coach did apologize and acknowledged the mistake. The author's public shaming might not be necessary to achieve their goal of accountability. There might be other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university administration directly or using media channels to share their story without publishing private emails.\n\nAlso, the impact on the coach's personal and professional life needs to be considered. Publicly exposing someone's mistake can have long-term consequences beyond the immediate issue. \n\nHowever, the family's distress is significant, and the coach's error caused real harm. The author's intent is protective of their sister and to prevent similar issues, which is understandable. But the method of using private emails raises ethical concerns about privacy versus the public's right to know.\n\nIn many cases, sharing private communications without consent can be legally and ethically problematic unless there's a clear public interest or if it's for the purpose of exposing wrongdoing. Here, the author's goal is to highlight a systemic issue in college admissions, which could be a public interest. But the line between accountability and invasion of privacy is thin.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author might be in the wrong if their public shaming is excessive or if they could have used other means to address the issue without exposing private emails. However, if the emails are factual and the author is using them to inform others about a mistake that affected their sister, it could be seen as justified. \n\nBut the key here is that the coach has already apologized, and the author's action might be more about seeking justice for their sister rather than exposing a broader issue. Publicly sharing private emails can sometimes be seen as a form of retaliation, which complicates the situation.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they shared private communications without consent, even if their intentions were good. However, others might argue it's justified to expose a mistake that harmed their sister. It's a close call, but the ethical line is crossed by sharing private emails publicly regardless of intent.\n"
