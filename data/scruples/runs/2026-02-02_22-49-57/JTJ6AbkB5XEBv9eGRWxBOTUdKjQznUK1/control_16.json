I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted their sister's emails is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister got a fake acceptance from a coach, which led to a lot of emotional distress. The author then published the email thread on social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance email to the sister, which was later corrected. The family is upset, and the author wants to publicize the incident to prevent others from going through the same thing. However, some people argue that the author shouldn't have shared the emails, possibly out of self-interest or to protect the coach or others involved.\n\nThe ethical considerations here are about privacy, intent, and the consequences. The author's intention was to raise awareness and maybe hold the university accountable. On the other hand, sharing private communications can be seen as violating privacy, even if the intent is good. The coach's mistake might have been an honest error, but the public exposure could damage their reputation unfairly if the mistake was genuine and not malicious.\n\nAlso, the impact on the sister is significant\u2014emotional harm from false hope. However, the public shaming could have repercussions on the coach and possibly other students. The swimmers who are defending the coach might feel that the author is harming their team's reputation, adding another layer of conflict.\n\nLegal aspects might also play a role. Sharing someone's private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy laws, depending on the jurisdiction. But since this is about moral responsibility rather than legal, the focus is on whether the action was justified.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the balance between accountability and privacy. If the coach's actions were truly a mistake, public exposure might be harsh. But if there's suspicion of wrongdoing beyond a simple error, it might be seen as necessary. The family's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it by publicizing private emails might be problematic. The author might be overstepping by using public shaming without giving the coach a chance to address it privately or through proper channels.\n\nSo, weighing the intent to help others against the privacy violation and potential harm to others, the author's action could be seen as wrong. The right approach might have been to address the issue through the university's channels first before going public.\n"
