I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister got an email from the coach saying she was accepted and part of the team. The family got excited, but then she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, sending the email to someone who hadn't been accepted yet. The author took screenshots of the emails and posted them publicly on social media to raise awareness about the university's mistake. Now, some people, including students at the university, are saying the author is wrong to do that.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but want my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break it down. The coach made an error by emailing the wrong group of students. The family was misled and the sister was emotionally affected. The author's intent in sharing the emails publicly was to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same experience. However, some might argue that sharing private emails without consent could be a privacy violation or damage the coach's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, there's also a public interest angle here, especially in the context of college admissions, which is a topic of national concern. The author might be justified if they believe the university's process is flawed and needs accountability. But there's a balance between accountability and respecting privacy. \n\nAnother point is that the coach did apologize and admitted the mistake. The author's action could be seen as retaliatory or damaging to the coach's career, especially if the emails were intended to be private. However, the coach's mistake caused harm to the student, so the author's action could be a form of seeking justice or transparency.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects here. Is publicizing the emails a form of shaming the coach, or is it a necessary step to hold the university accountable? If the coach's actions were a genuine mistake, does the author have the right to expose it? Also, considering that the sister's experience is personal, but the author is using it to make a broader point about college admissions practices.\n\nIn some cases, exposing such errors can prevent future mistakes. However, it's also possible that the author's public shaming goes beyond what's necessary, especially if the coach is already apologizing. The university might address the issue internally without public pressure. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the sister. The author's action might give her a platform to share her story and feel supported. But if the coach loses their job or faces public backlash, that could be a consequence the author didn't intend. \n\nI think there's a balance here. While the author's intentions are to highlight a real problem and support their sister, the method of using public shaming via social media might cross a line into personal attacks. The coach's mistake, while harmful, might not warrant public exposure of private communications. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for sharing the emails without considering the coach's privacy and due process. However, if the university isn't addressing the issue, maybe the author's action is justified. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. But since the coach already apologized and admitted the mistake, the author's publicizing might be unnecessary and could be seen as vindictive. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if the university isn't held accountable, the author's action could be seen as necessary. But without more info on the university's response, it's hard to say. Given the information, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to prevent others from being harmed, but maybe they should have approached the university first before going public. Since they didn't, maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, they have the right to share their story. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to raise awareness about a legitimate issue that affected their sister, and publicizing the emails is a way to advocate for other students. However, there's a counterargument that privacy was breached. But given the context of college admissions being a public concern, maybe it's justified. So, leaning towards B.\n"
