I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister got an email from the head swimming coach saying she was accepted to the university and the team, but then she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake\u2014he was emailing both applicants and accepted students and mixed up the messages. The author, the sister's sibling, took screenshots of the email thread and posted them publicly on social media to highlight the issue and make sure others know what happened. Now, some people are saying the author is wrong to do that, especially current students on the swim team.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. It seems like an honest error\u2014he was handling multiple groups and sent the wrong message. But the impact on the sister was significant: she was excited, then devastated. The family is upset, and the author wants to raise awareness to prevent this from happening to others. \n\nOn the other hand, publicizing private emails can be a privacy issue. The coach might have violated the sister's privacy if he shouldn't have shared that info, but the author is also using personal information without the sister's consent. Even if the intention is good\u2014to advocate and raise awareness\u2014there might be legal or ethical concerns about sharing private communications publicly. \n\nThen there's the perspective of the university and the swim team members. They might feel that the author is damaging the coach's reputation unfairly or that the public disclosure is unjust. The coach did apologize, so maybe the author should have addressed it privately. \n\nBut the sister's experience is real and harmful. The author might believe that public exposure is necessary for accountability and to inform others about potential issues in the admissions process. However, there's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting privacy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether publicizing the emails was justified. If the author intended to expose a systemic issue and prevent future mistakes, maybe not. But if it was done without considering the personal data and privacy of the individuals involved, then maybe yes. Also, the sister's consent wasn't mentioned here\u2014did she agree to have the emails shared? If not, that's a big problem. \n\nIn many cases, sharing private information without consent can be problematic, even if the intent is good. The coach's mistake was an error, but the author's public shaming could have repercussions for the coach and the university, possibly affecting other students or the coach's job. However, the sister's emotional distress is valid, and the author's actions might be seen as a form of seeking justice or support for their sister. \n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, sharing private emails without consent is likely a breach of privacy. Ethically, it's about whether the public interest in preventing similar mistakes overrides individual privacy. But if there's no evidence of malicious intent from the coach beyond a genuine mistake, the author might be crossing a line by exposing the emails publicly. Especially since the coach did apologize and correct the error. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private communications without consent, which could be seen as violating privacy, even if their intention was to highlight a problem. Alternatively, if the issue is a systemic one and the author felt no other avenue was available, maybe B. But given the context, the public shaming without consent probably makes them in the wrong.\n"
