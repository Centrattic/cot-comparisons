I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. So the situation is about their sister getting an email from a college coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family was really excited, then devastated when it was incorrect. The author then shared the email thread publicly on social media to make their point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He accidentally sent a message to applicants that they were accepted, which wasn't true. That's definitely a problem because it's a big deal for students relying on that info. The coach admitted it was an error, so he's responsible for the misinformation.\n\nNow, the author's action was to publicize the emails. The question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the family was harmed by the mistake, and the coach might not have taken it seriously. By sharing the emails, the author is holding the university accountable and trying to prevent others from going through the same thing. That could be seen as a way to bring attention to a systemic issue in college admissions, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach might have privacy concerns. The emails were between the coach and the student, so sharing them without consent could be a violation of privacy. Also, the coach might have other context or reasons for the mistake that aren't clear from the emails. Publicly shaming him could be unfair if there's more to the story. Plus, the other students mentioned (like the swimmers) might feel the author is damaging the coach's reputation without full knowledge.\n\nBut then, the coach did send the emails, and he's the one who made the mistake. The family's emotional distress was real, and they have a right to express their disappointment. However, the method of addressing it by sharing private communications publicly could be seen as crossing a line. It's a balance between accountability and privacy.\n\nLegal aspects: If the emails contain personal information or are part of a private communication, releasing them might be a breach of privacy. However, if they are just emails that were sent with the intention of recruiting, maybe there's less privacy expectation. But it's still their private correspondence.\n\nEthically, the author's intention was to protect others and seek justice for their sister. But the means involve exposing someone else's error publicly. There's a debate here between transparency and respect for privacy. Some might argue that the coach's mistake is part of a larger issue in college admissions and should be discussed publicly, while others might say that the author should handle it privately.\n\nThe two students from the university are saying it's wrong to share the emails, possibly because they're defending the coach or worried about their own programs. But their perspective might be biased.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author wrong? If they exposed private emails without consent, that's a breach of privacy. However, the context is a public issue (college admissions errors affecting students), which might justify the action. But the line between holding someone accountable and violating privacy is thin here. The coach's actions were definitely at fault, but the author's response might not be entirely justified either.\n\nHmm. I think the answer could go either way. But generally, sharing private communications without consent is considered wrong, even if the intent is good. So the author might be in the wrong for publicizing the emails, even if the coach was at fault. So answer A.\n"
