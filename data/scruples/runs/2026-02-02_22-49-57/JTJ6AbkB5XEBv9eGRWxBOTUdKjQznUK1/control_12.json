I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the older sibling) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was led to believe she was accepted into the university through a mistaken email from the coach. The family was excited, then devastated when it turned out to be a mistake. The author posted the emails online to raise awareness about the issue, but some people, especially students at the university, are claiming the author is wrong to do so.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few factors. \n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: Did the author have the right to share their sister's emails? The emails are between a minor (the sister) and the coach. Since the sister is a minor, maybe the author, as a parent or guardian, could have some authority. But the sister might have expected privacy. However, given the emotional impact and the fact that the coach made a mistake, there's an argument that the family is within their rights to share this to prevent similar situations.\n\n2. **Public Shaming vs. Accountability**: The author's intention was to hold the university accountable and warn others. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a form of exposing wrongdoing. However, sharing private communications without consent can lead to privacy issues and potential harm to the coach or university's reputation. But the context here is a mistake that caused real harm to the student, which might justify the action.\n\n3. **Impact on Individuals**: The students on the swim team who commented might feel the author is unfairly targeting the coach or the university. However, the author's goal is to highlight a systemic issue in the admissions process affecting students. The key here is whether the public exposure serves a greater good or is just personal retaliation.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations**: In most places, sharing private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy unless it's for a legitimate purpose. However, if the emails are part of a public interest matter (like a mistake in admissions affecting a student), it might be protected under whistleblower or public interest exceptions.\n\n5. **Ethical Angle**: Ethically, there's a balance between exposing misconduct and respecting privacy. The coach admitted fault, but the family felt betrayed and wanted to ensure others are aware. The author is acting in the interest of preventing similar mistakes for others.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions could be seen as justified to raise awareness and prevent future errors, even if it means sharing private emails. However, the method might be questionable if it infringes on privacy without consent. But given the context of a harmful mistake and the intent to inform others, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
