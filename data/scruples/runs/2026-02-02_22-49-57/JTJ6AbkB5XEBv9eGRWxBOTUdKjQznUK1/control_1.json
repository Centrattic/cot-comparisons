I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the swim coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister got an email from the coach saying she was accepted to the university and the swim team, which made the family and her really excited. Then later, she found out she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, sending an email meant for accepted students to someone who only applied early. The author then posted the emails publicly on social media to raise awareness about the university's mistake.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Was the coach's mistake significant? Yes, because it gave false hope. The author's action was to publicize the emails. The coach's response was to apologize and explain that it was a mistake in sending emails to both applicants and acceptances. The family felt wronged, and the author wanted to share the story publicly.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong to do that. Legally, sharing someone's emails without consent is typically a privacy violation. Even if the author's intention was to expose a mistake, releasing private communications without permission can be problematic. The coach's emails might contain personal information or internal communications that aren't meant for public consumption. Also, the university might have policies about such disclosures.\n\nEthically, even if the author's motive was to highlight a problem, the method of sharing private emails without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The coach might have legitimate reasons to keep communications private, especially regarding admissions processes. Additionally, the people who commented on social media, including current students, might feel that the author's actions could harm the coach's reputation unfairly or spread misinformation if the context isn't fully understood.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the university made a mistake that caused significant emotional distress to their sister, and they wanted to prevent others from going through the same. There's a public interest angle in exposing systemic issues in college admissions, especially if there's a pattern of such errors. But the means of doing so (without consent) complicates things.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author likely overstepped by publishing the emails without permission. Even with good intentions, sharing private information without consent can be wrong. The family could have reported the issue to the university or used other channels to address the problem. Publicizing it might have violated privacy and could have unintended consequences for the coach or the university, even if the story is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they shared private emails without consent, which is a breach of privacy, regardless of their intentions.\n"
