I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for sharing the email exchange publicly. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe sister was led to believe she was accepted into her dream school by the head swim coach, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email. The family is upset, and the author shared the emails on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. It seems like an honest error, but the consequences were severe for the student. The coach apologized, so there's accountability there. However, the impact on the student was significant emotional distress.\n\nNow, the author's action was to publicize the emails. The question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, sharing private communications without consent could be a breach of privacy. The coach might argue that this was a personal mistake and that public shaming is unfair, especially since they apologized. On the other hand, the author's intention was to prevent others from facing similar issues and to hold the university accountable. There's a public interest angle here, considering the ongoing scrutiny of college admissions.\n\nBut, there's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting individuals' privacy. The emails might contain personal information that shouldn't be shared without consent. Even if the coach made a mistake, publicizing the emails could harm their professional reputation beyond what's necessary. However, if the university is being held accountable, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe swimmers' comments suggest that some people at the university might feel biased, but that doesn't necessarily validate the author's action. The key points are intent, proportionality, and context. The author's intent was to inform and prevent future issues, which is a public good. However, the method of sharing private emails might cross a line. Depending on the content, there might be sensitive information that shouldn't be public.\n\nIn some cases, exposing such mistakes can lead to institutional changes. But there's also the ethical consideration of privacy. Without knowing the exact content of the emails or the platform used, it's hard to say, but generally, sharing private correspondence without consent can be problematic. Even with good intentions, it might be considered a violation of privacy.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for sharing the emails, even if the intent was noble. The right approach might have been to address it through official channels or media with proper context and without exposing personal communications.\n"
