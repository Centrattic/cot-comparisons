I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a younger sister who got rejected from her dream school, but the head swimming coach mistakenly told her she was accepted. The author, the older sibling, took screenshots of the email exchange and posted them publicly on social media. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coach's error led to the sister being wrongly told she was accepted, which caused emotional distress when she was actually rejected. The author publicized the emails to highlight the university's mistake and to prevent others from going through the same experience. However, some people, including current teammates of the coach, are criticizing the author for going public.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the author's intention was to expose a mistake that caused harm, which might be seen as a way to hold the university accountable and prevent future errors. On the other hand, publishing private emails could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent was good. The coach's error was admitted, but did the author have the right to share that information?\n\nAlso, the impact on the coach and the university's reputation is a factor. The author might have felt justified in exposing the mistake to support their sister, but others might argue that the matter should have been handled privately. The coach did apologize, so maybe the author's public post was unnecessary and could have been resolved without involving social media.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional state of the sister. The author was trying to help her by getting the story out, but using public shaming might not be the best approach. There's also the question of whether the author had the sister's consent to share the emails. If the sister didn't agree, that could be a problem. But the post doesn't mention that, so maybe it's assumed they discussed it.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the coach admitted fault, so the university might address it internally. Publicizing it could lead to more accountability, but it might also damage reputations unfairly. The other students on the team defending the coach might be biased, but the author's action could be seen as justified to tell their side.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response given the circumstances. If the university didn't take responsibility or the mistake was significant enough to warrant public attention, maybe the author is right. However, if the author acted impulsively without considering privacy or the coach's side, they might be in the wrong. Since the coach already apologized, going public might not have been necessary. So leaning towards AITA being A, the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author felt the system failed their sister, maybe B is correct. But I'm conflicted. Maybe the right answer is A because publishing private emails is generally considered wrong, regardless of intent. Privacy and privacy violations are a big deal, so even with good intentions, sharing those emails publicly without consent could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
