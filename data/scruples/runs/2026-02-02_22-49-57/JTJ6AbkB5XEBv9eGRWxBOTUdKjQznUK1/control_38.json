I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister got an email from the swimming coach of her dream school saying she was accepted into the university and the team. The family was really excited, but then the sister wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, sending her an email meant for someone else who was accepted. The author (the sister's sibling) then posted the email thread publicly on social media to highlight the university's mistake and prevent it from happening to others. Now, some people are saying the author is wrong to do this, especially current students on the swim team.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. It sounds like an honest error\u2014he was emailing both applicants and accepted students, mixed up the emails. He apologized and took responsibility. So the university might have a process issue, but the coach isn't malicious. \n\nThen the family's reaction: the sister was really upset, which is understandable. The author wants to publicize the emails to make the university accountable and raise awareness. But others argue that publishing private emails is a breach of privacy, even if the intent is good. The coach might have a reputation to protect, and the university could face backlash. Also, the current students (especially the swimmers) might feel that their coach's reputation is being unfairly tarnished, which they might not understand the sister's situation. \n\nSo the key points are: the author's intent was to expose a mistake that harmed their sister, but the method involved sharing private communications. Was the author justified in doing so? Legally, sharing emails without consent could be an issue. Ethically, it's a balance between accountability and privacy. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent other students from going through the same pain. Publicizing the mistake could push the university to improve their communication. On the other hand, the emails might contain personal information, and airing them publicly could be seen as shaming the coach or the university, even if it's a simple mistake. The coach did apologize, so maybe the author could have addressed it privately instead of going public. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the swimmers are biased and don't understand the sister's pain. But does that justify public exposure? Maybe not. There might be other ways to advocate for change without revealing private emails. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intent versus the impact. The author's intent is to help others, but the action might be considered overstepping by invading privacy. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be seen as a justified action to hold the university accountable (B). \n\nHmm. I think the coach made a mistake, the author is upset, but sharing private emails without consent is generally seen as crossing a line. Even if the motive is good, using public shaming through private correspondence might be the issue here. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the university isn't being held accountable otherwise. It's a tough call. However, in ethical terms, respecting privacy usually matters, so the author might be overreacting, hence AITA.\n"
