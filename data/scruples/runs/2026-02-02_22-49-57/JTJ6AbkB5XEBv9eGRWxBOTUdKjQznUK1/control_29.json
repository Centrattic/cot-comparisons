I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author's sister is a high school senior applying to college and is a competitive swimmer. She got an email from the head swim coach of her dream school saying she was accepted and encouraging her to join the team. The family got excited, but then the sister wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake where he sent the wrong email to people who had applied but weren't accepted. The author then publicized the email thread on social media to raise awareness about the situation, but some people, including students from the university, are upset, saying the author shouldn't have done that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually accepted. That's a serious error, but the coach did apologize. The family was hurt, and the sister was devastated. The author's response was to post the emails publicly. \n\nWhen someone is wronged, especially in a situation like this, there can be different ways to handle it. The author's intention was to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same experience. But sharing private emails publicly could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the intention is to expose a mistake. \n\nPrivacy is a big concern here. Even though the emails were part of the issue, posting them on social media makes them public, which could have consequences for all parties involved, including the coach and possibly the university. The university might have their own processes for handling such mistakes, and the author's action could interfere with that. Also, the students on the swim team who are defending the coach might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach, which could be seen as damaging to his reputation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister went through a lot of emotional distress. The coach's mistake was significant, and the author might feel that the public wasn't aware of how serious this mistake was. However, the appropriate way to address this might be through the university's channels rather than social media. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the intention was good, sharing private communications without consent could be considered a breach of privacy. The author might have had the right to express their frustration, but using the emails publicly could be crossing a line. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified in the context of exposing the mistake. \n\nAnother angle: the coach did apologize and acknowledged the mistake. The author's public shaming might not be the best approach. The university might handle it internally, and the author's action could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without considering the privacy of the other parties and the potential consequences, even if the coach made a mistake. The right action would be to address it through proper channels, not public social media. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
