I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for posting the emails between their sister and the swimming coach. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted before she actually was, leading to a big emotional letdown. The family is upset, and the author publicized the emails on social media to raise awareness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coach made a mistake by sending a premature acceptance message. That's definitely on the coach. But then the author decided to share the emails publicly. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nOn one hand, the family was wronged. The sister was led to believe she was accepted, which caused emotional distress. The coach's error is unprofessional, and the author might feel the need to expose this to prevent others from facing the same issue. Publicizing it could be seen as a form of accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent can be a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to highlight a mistake. The coach and other parties involved might have a right to privacy. Also, the author's action could lead to personal attacks on the coach or the university, which might not be fair. The coach apologized, so maybe the appropriate step was to address it privately rather than publicly. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author had the right to post the emails. Even if the intention is good, using someone else's private correspondence without their consent could be problematic. The sister is a minor, so maybe the author thought it was okay, but the emails are between the sister and the coach. \n\nThe people who are against the author's action argue that the swimmers at the university are biased and might not understand the sister's situation. But does that justify public exposure? It's a tough call. The coach's mistake was in poor judgment, but the author's action could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The coach is definitely at fault for the mistake. The author's intent was to advocate for their sister and prevent others from similar issues. However, the method of using public shaming or exposure might be questionable. \n\nI think the key factors are the intent and the consequences. If the author's goal was to hold the coach and university accountable and prevent future incidents, it's understandable. But if the primary motive was revenge or to embarrass the coach, then it's more in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the author's action was proportionate and necessary. \n\nSince the coach already apologized, maybe the appropriate course was to address it through the university's channels rather than publicizing it. However, if the university didn't take action, then publicizing it could be a way to pressure them. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action is morally ambiguous. While the coach's mistake is inexcusable, publicizing the emails without consent could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because sharing private communications without consent can be a breach of privacy regardless of intent. However, some might argue B, because the situation was a clear case of negligence by the coach. But given the general consensus on privacy, probably A.\n"
