I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author publicizing emails between their sister and a college swim coach. The coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, but she wasn't. The family is upset, and the author put the emails on social media to highlight the issue. Now, some people, including students at the university, are criticizing the author for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The coach made an error by sending an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually accepted. The author's sister was emotionally affected, which is understandable. The author's action was to share the emails publicly to bring attention to the problem and prevent others from facing the same issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did the author have the right to share the emails? Was the coach's mistake a serious one that warranted public exposure? Could the publicizing of the emails cause harm to the coach or the university beyond the intended purpose of accountability?\n\nThe coach's apology mentions that he was emailing both applicants and acceptances, leading to an error. However, the coach's mistake caused significant emotional distress to the student. The author's intent was to raise awareness and possibly prevent future mistakes. However, sharing private emails without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy for the coach and the university, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action could be seen as a form of holding institutions accountable, especially in a system where college admissions are highly scrutinized. The sister was a competitive swimmer, and the coach's error might have implications for other student-athletes.\n\nBut, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. Publicly sharing emails can be considered a violation of privacy unless there's a clear public interest. The author's action might have crossed that line, even if the intention was to help others. The counterargument is that the university and coach should be held responsible for their mistake, which the author is doing by exposing it.\n\nAnother angle: the people who criticized the author include current students, possibly fearing backlash or damage to their own programs. The author might argue that transparency is necessary here.\n\nHowever, the coach's mistake might be a human error, and public shaming could be disproportionate. The author's action might prevent the coach from learning from the mistake and improving, instead of fostering a culture of accountability through proper channels (like contacting the university's administration directly).\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent was to help their sister and prevent others from similar situations, but the method of publicizing the emails could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they publicly exposed private communications without considering the privacy of the involved parties, even though the intent was good. Alternatively, if the public exposure serves a greater good of accountability, maybe B.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author had a right to do that. In many cases, sharing private emails without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy, regardless of intent. So even if the coach made a mistake, the author's action of sharing the emails publicly might not be justified. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
