I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister getting falsely informed she was accepted to a university through a coach's mistake, leading to emotional distress. The author then publicly shared the email thread.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of each party. The coach made an error by sending an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually accepted. That's a clear mistake. The family was misled, which caused their sister a lot of emotional pain. \n\nThe author decided to publicize the emails on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same. The key here is whether publicizing the emails was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were trying to hold the university accountable and raise awareness about such errors affecting student-athletes. They might feel that transparency is necessary here. \n\nOn the other hand, the coach and the university might claim that the mistake was unintentional and that public exposure could lead to reputational harm or other consequences. The students at the university might also feel that sharing the emails is unfair, especially if they didn't contribute to the mistake. \n\nBut the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Publicly sharing private communications can be a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, releasing emails without consent can be problematic. The coach's mistake was apologized for, but the author's action might not take into account the coach's position or the potential for misunderstanding. \n\nHowever, the family had been wronged, and the author wanted to prevent similar issues for others. But maybe there were other ways to address this without public exposure, like contacting the university directly or seeking media attention through proper channels.\n\nSo, considering the balance between the right to privacy and the intent to expose a mistake that caused harm. The author's action could be seen as justified if they were advocating for their sister and seeking justice. But if the emails were private, sharing them without consent might be a violation of privacy, making the author wrong.\n\nI'm a bit torn. However, in many cases, sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong unless there's a compelling public interest. Since this is a personal matter affecting their family, publicizing it might not be justified. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
