I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, the situation: the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which led to a lot of emotional distress when she actually wasn't. The family was upset, and the author posted the emails on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same thing.\n\nThe coach admitted he made an error by mixing up emails from applicants and those who were accepted. The author's intent was to raise awareness and hold the university accountable. However, some people, including current students, argue that sharing the emails publicly was wrong, possibly harming the coach's reputation or the university's image.\n\nNow, considering ethics and legality. Was there any breach of privacy? The emails were between the coach and the sister, but they were shared without the coach's consent. Publicizing personal communications can be problematic, especially if it's not in the public interest. However, the author's argument is that they're exposing a systemic issue in college admissions, which is a matter of public concern, especially since the admissions process is under scrutiny.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the intent is good, sharing private communications without consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. The coach might have legitimate concerns about his reputation. But the sister was the victim here, and the author is trying to advocate for her. \n\nAlso, the coach's mistake was significant and caused harm. The author's action could be justified as a form of accountability. However, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. Social media can amplify the story, but it can also lead to public shaming without due process.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister's emotional distress is real. The author is acting on her behalf to seek justice. But is public shaming the right approach? Maybe there are other ways to address this, like contacting the university's administration directly instead of going public.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are understandable to raise awareness and prevent similar issues, publicly sharing the emails might cross a line into privacy invasion. However, given the context of the coach's error causing significant harm, some might argue it's a justified form of holding the university accountable. The answer could depend on cultural or personal views on privacy versus accountability.\n"
