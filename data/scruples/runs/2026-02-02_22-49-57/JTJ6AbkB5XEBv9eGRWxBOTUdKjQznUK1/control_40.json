I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publishing the emails between their sister and the swim coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told she was accepted by the university through the coach's email before the official letter came. Then it turned out she wasn't accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, sending an email meant for accepted students to applicants. The family is upset, and the author posted the email thread publicly to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author did the wrong thing by sharing those emails. Let's break it down. The coach made a mistake, which affected the student. The author's action was to publicize the emails to hold the university accountable and to raise awareness. On one hand, the coach's error is inexcusable, and the student went through emotional distress. The family's frustration is justified. On the other hand, sharing private emails publicly can have consequences for the coach and the university, possibly violating privacy or confidentiality. There's a line between accountability and overstepping.\n\nThe coach's apology mentions a mistake in the email, but the sister suffered because of it. The author's intention was to prevent others from experiencing this, which is understandable. However, publishing the emails might have exposed the coach and the university's internal communications without consent. The sister's privacy is also a factor here. While the family is upset, they might have shared the emails without considering the coach's perspective or the potential repercussions, like damage to the coach's career or the university's reputation. \n\nIn some cases, public shaming or exposing someone's errors without their consent can be seen as harmful, even if the original mistake was on the other side. The author might have crossed a line by using public social media to disclose personal communication, even if their intent was to bring attention to a systemic issue. However, if the emails were in the public domain or the coach's actions were malicious, the situation might be different. Since the coach's email was a genuine mistake, not malice, the author's action might be considered harsh. \n\nAnother angle: the swimmers and others at the university feel the author is wrong to publicize this. They might be in a position where their own coach's reputation is at stake, so their perspective could be biased. However, the author's action could also be seen as a form of whistleblowing to prevent future mistakes. The key here is whether the author's public disclosure was necessary and appropriate. If the family had first tried to resolve it through proper channels (like filing a complaint with the university's administration) and then decided to go public, that might be different. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic. Even if the intent is good, the act itself can be a privacy violation. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the coach's position and the potential for unintended consequences beyond the immediate issue. However, the coach's mistake caused harm, and the family's exposure of the emails was a response to that harm. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because publicizing private emails without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially a violation of the coach's due process. However, the coach did make a mistake that caused harm to the sister. The line between accountability and privacy is thin here. But since the author took it public without exhausting other avenues, it's more likely they are in the wrong.\n"
