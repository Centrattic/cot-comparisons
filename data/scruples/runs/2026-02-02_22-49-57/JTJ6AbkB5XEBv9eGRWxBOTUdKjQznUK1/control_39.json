I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who posted the email thread on social media is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister got an email from the head swimming coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach had sent the same message to both applicants and those who were accepted. The family was really excited, then found out it was an error. The author put the emails online to show their disappointment and make others aware of the issue with the university.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. The main points here are about privacy, intent, and the consequences. The author took screenshots of personal emails and shared them publicly. Even though the sister was upset and the coach made a mistake, sharing private correspondence without consent could be a problem. The emails might have sensitive information, like the sister's application status, which is personal. The coach's error was a mistake, but publishing the emails could damage their reputation or cause other issues. The other students at the university and the team are upset because they think the author is being biased and not considering the coach's side, but maybe their perspective is limited.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to highlight a mistake that caused harm to their sister. They might be trying to raise awareness to prevent similar situations. However, public shaming or exposing private emails might not be the best way to address it. It's possible that the author's actions, while understandable emotionally, cross the line into violating privacy. The coach already apologized, so maybe the author's response was too harsh. Also, the sister's experience is valid, but sharing the emails could lead to more backlash than support. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the author is right about the university's mistake, sharing private communications without consent is generally considered wrong. There might be legal issues too, depending on the jurisdiction, but the main ethical point is about respecting privacy. The other students are students and team members who might have a different view because they support the coach, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right in breaking privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared private information without permission, even if the intent was to address a wrong. The appropriate action might have been to contact the university's administration directly or through proper channels instead of publicizing it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
