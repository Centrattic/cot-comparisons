I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's younger sister got an email from a university's head swimming coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach had actually sent the email to people who either applied early or were accepted, and mixed them up. The sister was really excited, thinking she got in, only to find out later she wasn't. The author then posted the email thread publicly on social media to highlight the issue and show how wrong it was. Now, some people, especially current students on the swim team, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coach made a mistake, which is unfortunate. The sister was emotionally affected, and the family is upset. The author's intention was to publicize the situation to prevent others from going through the same thing. But did they go too far by sharing the emails?\n\nPublicly sharing private emails without consent can be a breach of privacy. Even if the intent is to hold someone accountable, there's a line between seeking justice and violating privacy. The coach might have a right to privacy in their communications, even if they made a mistake. Also, the author might not have considered the potential consequences for the coach, like damage to their reputation or job, beyond the apology they already gave.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach's mistake had real emotional consequences for the sister. The author's action could be seen as a form of whistleblowing to expose a systemic issue in college admissions. However, sharing the emails without the coach's consent might not be the appropriate way to address it. Maybe the family should have taken another route, like contacting the university administration or media directly, rather than making the emails public.\n\nThe current students on the team might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach and the university, which could affect their trust in the administration. The author's action could be seen as harmful to the coach's career and the university's reputation, even if the coach admitted fault. There's also the consideration of whether the author's public shaming is necessary or if the issue could have been resolved privately.\n\nAnother angle: the coach's mistake was admitted, and they apologized. The family got their explanation and the apology. The author might have felt it wasn't enough, but sharing the emails publicly might not be the right response. It could be seen as vigilantism rather than a proper recourse.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's intent was to inform others and prevent similar issues, but the method might be questionable. The right approach might involve contacting the university's administration to ensure such mistakes are prevented in the future, rather than publicizing the emails.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for sharing the emails publicly without consent, even if they had good intentions. However, some might argue that the situation justifies it given the emotional harm caused. But legally and ethically, sharing private communications without permission is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
