I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story online) is in the wrong for sharing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach. The situation is that the sister was mistakenly told she was accepted into the university, which led to her being upset when the official acceptance never came. The author took screenshots and posted them publicly to highlight the issue and seek support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Publicizing private emails without consent can be a problem. The coach's emails were private, and sharing them might violate privacy norms or even policies. Even if the content is problematic, there's a line between reporting a mistake and exposing personal communications. \n\nThen, the intent matters. The author's goal was to hold the university accountable and prevent others from going through the same experience. That's a noble intention, but does that justify sharing the emails? It's possible that the coach's error was an honest mistake, and while it was negligent, making the emails public might harm the coach's reputation without a clear justification. The family was already in contact with the university, so maybe there's a better way to address the issue through proper channels rather than social media.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister was emotionally affected, and the family is frustrated. The coach's explanation might be seen as dismissive or not taking enough responsibility. The author could argue that the university's admissions process is flawed and needs public scrutiny. However, sharing the emails could be seen as a form of doxxing or shaming, which might not be appropriate even if the coach was at fault. \n\nAlso, the response from current students suggests that the author's actions might be harming the swim team's reputation or the coach's standing. If the coach is part of a community that's being unfairly targeted, the author might be overstepping. But if the university's practices are indeed problematic, then highlighting the issue could be justified. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The author could face backlash for breaching privacy, or it might lead to the university improving their processes. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. The coach's mistake might be a one-time error, and sharing the emails could lead to unwarranted personal attacks. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to bring attention to a serious issue, sharing private emails without consent might cross into unethical territory. The right approach might have been to contact the university's administration to address the mistake and perhaps file a complaint through official channels. Publicizing the emails could be seen as in the wrong because it's a private matter and might not be the best way to advocate for change. So I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
