I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister got an email from a college swim coach saying she was accepted, but it was a mistake. The coach confused her with others who were actually accepted. The sister was thrilled, then crushed when the official acceptance didn't come. The author then posted the email thread publicly to show how the university messed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to highlight a mistake that caused their sister real emotional distress. They wanted to prevent this from happening to others. On the other hand, the author published private emails without the coach's consent. The coach apologized, but the author feels it's a serious issue worth publicizing.\n\nIs there a violation of privacy here? The emails are between the sister and the coach, so publishing them without permission might be an invasion of privacy. However, the sister might have given implicit permission by sharing the emails with her family. But even then, making them public on social media could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the coach made an error, but the author's response could harm the coach's reputation and maybe the university's. The other students argue that the author shouldn't publicize this. But the author is trying to hold the coach accountable and warn others about the college admissions process flaws.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Maybe contacting the university's administration first to address the issue privately. But if they didn't respond adequately, public exposure might be a form of protest. However, using private correspondence without consent could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent is good.\n\nAlso, considering the sister's emotional state, the author might feel justified in seeking justice for her. The coach's apology might not have been sufficient, so the author took matters into their own hands. But does that justify leaking private emails?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wrongs done by the coach are clear, but the author's method of exposing it could have consequences. The key factors are intent, proportionality of the response, and the violation of privacy. If the author's actions caused unnecessary harm to the coach beyond what's necessary for accountability, that could tip the balance. But if the author's goal was to prevent future harm and the coach's error was significant, it might be seen as justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in a morally ambiguous position. However, since the author's intent was to prevent future issues and the coach's mistake was real and impactful, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong. Others might say that using private emails without permission is still wrong regardless of intent. The answer depends on whether the means justify the ends.\n"
