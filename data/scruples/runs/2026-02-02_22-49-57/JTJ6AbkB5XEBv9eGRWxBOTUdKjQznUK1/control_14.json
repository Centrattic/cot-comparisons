I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for sharing the emails publicly. The sister got an email from the coach saying she was accepted, but then later found out she wasn't. The family was upset, and the author put the email thread on social media to share their frustration and warn others. But some people, especially students at the university, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach clearly made an error by sending an incorrect email. The family felt misled and hurt, which is understandable. The author's intention was to highlight the university's mistake and make sure others don't go through the same thing. That seems like a valid reason for wanting to expose the issue. However, sharing private emails publicly can be a privacy concern. The coach might have private communications with other applicants, and releasing that could be problematic. But in this case, the emails were between the coach and the sister, so maybe they aren't that private anymore. \n\nAlso, the coach admitted fault and apologized, which shows responsibility. The author's action was to bring attention to a systemic issue in college admissions, which is a public concern. But the sister's experience is personal, and sharing it publicly might have consequences for the coach and the university. The other students argue that the author shouldn't publicize it because it's not fair to the coach or the team. However, the author's perspective is that the university should be held accountable for their mistake.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to advocate for their sister and share their story to prevent similar issues. On the other, there's the aspect of respecting the coach's privacy and the potential for the information to be misused. But given that the coach admitted the error, maybe the emails are relevant to show the mistake. It's a balance between the right to privacy and the right to inform the public about institutional errors. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their intention was to highlight a genuine mistake that caused harm, and they are advocating for transparency in a process that affects many students. However, maybe they could have approached it more discreetly, like contacting the university directly first. But since they did publicize it, some might argue it's overstepping. However, given the emotional impact on the sister and the systemic nature of the issue, the author's actions might be justified. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
