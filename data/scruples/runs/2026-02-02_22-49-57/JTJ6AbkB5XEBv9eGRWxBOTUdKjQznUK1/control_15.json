I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for sharing the email exchange publicly. The sister was led to believe she was accepted into a school and the team, but it turned out to be a mistake by the coach. The author put the emails on social media to highlight the issue. Now, some people are saying the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach sent an email to applicants and accepted students, mixing them up. He apologized, saying it was an error. The family felt wronged because this caused emotional distress to the sister, who had already started planning based on the false acceptance.\n\nThe author's action was to publicize the emails. The question is whether this was justified. On one hand, the family might feel they need to expose the mistake to prevent others from similar experiences. The coach's error affected their daughter's college plans and mental health. Publicizing it could serve as a warning and hold the university accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach did apologize. The author might have breached the coach's privacy by releasing the emails, even if the intention was good. There's a line between holding someone accountable and causing unnecessary harm to the coach's reputation. Also, the individuals (like the students on the team) might feel the public shaming is unfair, especially if the coach had no malicious intent.\n\nAnother angle: the family was already in communication with the coach, and the mother had directly informed him. The author's social media post might be seen as an escalation without giving the university or coach a chance to address the issue internally first. However, the family's frustration is real, and they might not trust the university to take responsibility without public pressure.\n\nLegal considerations: Depending on the jurisdiction, releasing private emails without consent could be illegal. But the user is asking about moral wrong, not legal. Still, that's a factor in public opinion.\n\nThe sister's emotional state is a key point. The author's intent was to prevent others from going through the same, but the method involved exposing the coach's mistake publicly. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. The coach's error harmed the student, so the author's action might be seen as justified in some circles, but others might say it's a case of not letting the coach's mistake affect others through public shaming.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the goal was to protect other students, maybe not. If the method was to publicly shame the coach without giving him a chance to correct things, maybe yes. But the coach already apologized. The author might have overstepped by making it public. Alternatively, the family's emotional trauma justifies the action.\n\nI need to decide between A and B. The answer depends on whether the publicization is seen as a reasonable response to a serious mistake or an overreaction. Considering the coach's apology and the potential for the author to have handled it differently (like contacting the university first), maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the university didn't take responsibility, maybe not. The question is whether the author's action is justified. If the author's intent was to inform others and the coach's mistake was significant, then B (not in the wrong). If the author acted out of anger and without considering the coach's explanation, then A (in the wrong).\n\nGiven the context, the coach did apologize and said it was a mistake. The author's action was to make the emails public. Whether that's acceptable is debatable. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) if the intent was to prevent others from being harmed, but the action could be seen as crossing a line. Alternatively, A if the author should have handled it privately. The coach's explanation is that it was a mistake, not a deliberate lie. The author might have publicized it without considering the coach's position, leading to potential unfair damage to his reputation. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was to highlight a systemic issue and prevent others from similar experiences. The coach's mistake had real consequences, and the author's action could serve as a cautionary tale. However, there's a counterargument about privacy and due process. But weighing the emotional impact on the sister and the coach's apology, the publicization might be seen as a justified response. So, the answer is B.\n"
