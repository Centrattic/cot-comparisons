I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for publicizing the email between their sister and the head swim coach. The sister was falsely told she was accepted, leading to a lot of emotional distress. The author posted the email thread online to highlight the university's mistake and make sure others understand the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to expose a mistake that caused harm to their sister. The coach admitted to an error, but the family felt that sharing the emails was necessary to raise awareness. However, there's a counterpoint: by publishing the emails, they might have violated the coach's privacy or exposed him publicly without a fair process. \n\nOn one hand, the family has a right to seek justice and prevent others from going through the same experience. Sharing the emails could serve as a warning and hold the university accountable. On the other hand, sharing private communications without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent is good. The coach might have personal or professional repercussions from this public exposure beyond just the initial mistake.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and the method. The author's intent was to support their sister and prevent future issues, which is understandable. However, the method involved public shaming or exposing private information. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. In some contexts, exposing such mistakes is acceptable, but in others, it could lead to unwarranted personal attacks on the coach, especially if there's no proof of malicious intent beyond a mistake.\n\nI should also consider if there were other steps the family could have taken first, like contacting the university's administration formally or seeking a complaint resolution. Since they did contact the coach and the university, maybe they felt those avenues were insufficient. Still, publicizing the emails might be seen as escalation without giving the involved parties a chance to resolve it behind the scenes.\n\nThe coach's apology was for a mistake, not malice. If the author's post leads to the coach losing his job or facing personal attacks without a fair process, that could be problematic. However, if the public attention leads to the university improving their processes and preventing future errors, there's a positive outcome.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the line between holding someone accountable and public humiliation can be thin. The author might argue it's justified, but others might see it as overstepping. The answer hinges on whether the ends (preventing harm and accountability) justify the means (public exposure without consent). \n\nI think the author's actions are not entirely in the wrong because the intent was protective and to prevent future issues, but there's a case to be made that they could have handled it differently. However, given the context of the college admissions situation and the emotional impact, it's more about the necessity of the action rather than malicious intent. So leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
