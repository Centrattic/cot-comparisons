I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publicizing the email thread between their sister and the coach. The situation is that the sister was told she was accepted by a university through a coach's email, but it turned out to be a mistake. The family was upset, and the person shared the emails publicly to show the university's mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coach made an error, sending an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually accepted. The family was misled and the sister was emotionally affected. The person took screenshots and posted them publicly, which led to some backlash from students at the university, particularly swimmers.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to publicize the emails? Was there a breach of privacy or trust? Was the action justified in exposing a mistake that affected their sister?\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were trying to hold the university accountable and prevent others from going through the same issue. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a form of social media activism to highlight a systemic issue in college admissions.\n\nOn the other hand, the emails might contain personal information or private communications that the sister didn't consent to be shared. Even if the coach made a mistake, sharing the emails without the sister's permission could be seen as violating her privacy. Also, the coach might have legitimate concerns about being publicly shamed, even if the mistake was genuine.\n\nThe coach did apologize, explaining that he was emailing both applicants and accepted students. However, the family's reaction is understandable given the emotional impact on the sister. The question is whether exposing the emails was the right approach. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to raise awareness and protect others, but there's a risk of overstepping by sharing private information without consent.\n\nAlso, considering the responses from current students, they might feel that the author's public shaming is unfair, especially if the coach made a genuine mistake. The swimmers might have their own experiences with the coach and feel biased against the author.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's action could be justified if it's in the public interest to prevent similar mistakes. However, if the emails contain personal details that aren't necessary for the broader message, it could be problematic. The author also didn't consult the sister before sharing, which might be an issue if she didn't agree.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to support their sister and prevent future issues, but the method involved publicizing private information without consent. Depending on the content of the emails and the sister's wishes, the author could be seen as overreaching. However, given the coach's admission of error and the university's potential responsibility, the author's action might be understandable. But legally and ethically, sharing private emails without consent is generally not advisable. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
