I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the swimming coach. The sister got an incorrect acceptance email from the coach, leading to false hope, and then was rejected. The author posted the emails online to raise awareness about the university's mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The coach made a mistake, but the author is publicizing private emails. Public shaming or exposing others can be a sensitive issue. On one hand, the coach's error caused emotional distress to the student. On the other hand, releasing emails without consent could invade the coach's privacy or cause harm to his reputation, even if unintentional.\n\nThe family's frustration is understandable, especially since the sister went through a lot of stress. The author's intention was to warn others and hold the university accountable. But is publicizing the emails the right way to do that? Maybe there are other avenues, like contacting the university directly or using official channels to address the issue without exposing personal communications.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the swimmers at the university who are defending the coach. They might not be aware of the situation or might feel the emails shouldn't be public. The author argues they are biased, but that doesn't mean the author's actions are justified. \n\nPrivacy laws and consent matter here. If the emails were private, sharing them publicly without permission is a breach of privacy, regardless of the intent. The coach might have made a mistake, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. However, some might argue that the public has a right to know if the university's process is flawed, especially in the context of college admissions being a hot topic.\n\nBalancing the harm caused by the coach's mistake versus the harm of publicizing private emails is tricky. The emotional distress to the sister is significant, but so is the potential damage to the coach's career if the emails are made public. The author's intent is to prevent similar situations, but there might be more appropriate ways to do that without violating privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coach's error was inexcusable, the author's response of sharing the emails publicly could be seen as wrong because it infringes on the coach's privacy and potentially causes further harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
