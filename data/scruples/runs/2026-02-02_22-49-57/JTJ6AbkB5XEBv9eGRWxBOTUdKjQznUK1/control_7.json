I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's younger sister got into a college through a mistake by the swim coach. The coach accidentally emailed their sister thinking she was accepted, which led the family to believe she was in. Then later, they found out it was a mistake, and the sister was devastated. In response, the author posted the email threads publicly on social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of publicizing someone else's private emails. Even though the sister was wronged, sharing private communications without consent can be problematic. The coach might have a right to privacy too. But then again, the coach made an error that caused significant harm to a student.\n\nThe family's intention was to raise awareness and prevent similar issues. However, by publicizing the emails, the author might have exposed the coach's mistake and personal information, which could be seen as public shaming. The other students and swimmers from the university argue that the author is wrong to do this, possibly because it affects their community or the coach's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the coach violated the family's trust and that sharing the emails was necessary to hold the institution accountable. The college admissions process is indeed a hot topic, and the author might feel the need to highlight the flaws in the system.\n\nBut is it justified? There might be alternative ways to address the issue, like reporting it to the university administration or seeking legal recourse, rather than publicizing it on social media. Public exposure can be a form of vigilantism, and it's not always the right approach. It's possible that the author overstepped by not seeking other avenues first.\n\nAlso, the sister's emotional distress is understandable, but using public shaming might not be the best way to help her. The university might have policies in place to handle such mistakes, and the author's actions could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, publicizing private emails without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. The coach's mistake was unfortunate, but the author's method of addressing it might be unethical. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
