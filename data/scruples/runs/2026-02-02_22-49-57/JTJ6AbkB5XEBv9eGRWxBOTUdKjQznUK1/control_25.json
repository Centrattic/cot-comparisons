I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their younger sister getting a mistaken acceptance from a swim coach, which turned out to be a big mix-up. The sister was really excited, and then found out she wasn't actually accepted. The family is upset, and the author publicized the email thread on social media to raise awareness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. The coach made a mistake, but the author took it public. On one hand, the family's frustration is understandable. The sister went through emotional turmoil because of this error. The author's intention was to highlight the problem and maybe prevent it from happening to others. But on the other hand, publishing the emails might have exposed the coach and the university to public scrutiny, which could be seen as a privacy or reputational issue for them. Also, the swim team members and others involved might have their own perspectives, like the students mentioned who are defending the coach.\n\nI should think about whether the author had the right to share the emails. Email threads are usually private, and sharing them without consent could be considered a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method might be questionable. The coach's apology mentions that it was an error, so maybe the university wants to handle it internally. The author's action could be seen as adding public pressure, which might be unfair to the coach if it was a genuine mistake. However, there's also the argument that the family has a right to seek accountability, especially if the university isn't addressing the issue properly.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's well-being. The author did it to support their sister and draw attention to her experience. But could this have caused more harm, like damaging the coach's career unnecessarily or the university's reputation, without a clear benefit? Or does it serve a public good by making admissions processes more transparent?\n\nI should also consider the response from other students. If they're defending the coach, maybe they feel the author is attacking the coach unjustly. The author might be seen as crossing a line by using public shaming rather than addressing it through proper channels first. However, maybe the family tried other avenues and found them ineffective, leading to the public post.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about balancing the right to privacy and due process versus the need for accountability. If the author didn't give the university a chance to resolve the issue internally before going public, that could be a problem. But if the university is dismissive, then publicizing could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action is a bit of a gray area. However, sharing private emails without consent is generally frowned upon, even if the intent is good. It might be seen as the author being in the wrong for not respecting the privacy of the communications, even if they had bad intentions. Alternatively, if the coach's mistake was a systemic issue that needed exposure, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the key point is the public shaming without giving the other side a chance to address it privately first. The answer might hinge on that. I think the consensus here is that the author is in the wrong because they publicized private emails, even though the situation is frustrating. So answer A.\n"
