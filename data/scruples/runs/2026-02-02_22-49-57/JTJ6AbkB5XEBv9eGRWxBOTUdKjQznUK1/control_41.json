I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for posting their sister's emails publicly. The situation is that the sister got an email from a coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family was happy, then devastated when the official acceptance didn't come. The author posted the emails online to highlight the issue, but some people, especially current students on the swim team, are criticizing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance email to the sister when she wasn't actually accepted. The family was misled, leading to emotional distress. The author's action was to publicize the emails to raise awareness and prevent similar issues for other student-athletes.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author's intent is understandable\u2014they want to expose a mistake that caused harm and hold the university accountable. They're trying to protect others from the same experience. But on the other hand, posting private emails publically could be a breach of privacy, even if the intention is good. The coach might have violated privacy by sending the email, but the sister and author might not have the right to share that information without consent.\n\nAlso, the coach admitted it was a mistake, so maybe the university will address it internally. Public shaming could damage the coach's reputation unnecessarily, even if the mistake was genuine. However, the argument is that the coach's actions were part of the problem, so exposing it isn't malicious.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's right to her emotions and the family's frustration. They might feel that the only way to get justice or acknowledgment is through public pressure. But is that ethical? There's a balance between seeking accountability and respecting individual privacy.\n\nIn some cases, sharing such information could be seen as harassment or defamation, depending on the context. If the emails clearly show negligence or misconduct, maybe it's justified. But if it's just a human error, public exposure might be excessive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the current students are biased, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right. Publicizing private communications can backfire, even if the intent is good. The line between advocacy and invasion of privacy is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I'm torn. The author's motives are noble, but the method might be questionable. It's possible they are in the wrong for breaching privacy, but others might see it as a necessary action for accountability. However, the coach's mistake was admitted, and the university might handle it internally. Public exposure could have unintended consequences, like harming the coach's career for a mistake. Therefore, the author's action might cross the line into public shaming without due process. So I think the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
