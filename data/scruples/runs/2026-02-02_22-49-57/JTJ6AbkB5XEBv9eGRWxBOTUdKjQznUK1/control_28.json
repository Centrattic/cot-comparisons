I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the sister got an email from the head swim coach saying she was accepted, which made the family and her really excited. But then she wasn't actually accepted, and the coach admitted it was a mistake. The author then put the emails on social media to publicize the incident, and some people are upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. It sounds like he sent the acceptance email to a student who wasn't actually accepted. That's a serious error because it gives false hope, leading to emotional distress. The coach took responsibility, which is a good sign, but the damage was already done.\n\nNow, the author's action was to share the email thread publicly. The main question is whether this was justified. On one hand, the author's intent was to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same experience. Publicizing it could serve as a warning and maybe push the university or the admissions office to improve their processes. It's about accountability. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy. The coach might have had a good reason for the mistake, but the author's action could harm the coach's reputation even if it was an honest error. Also, the university might have internal procedures to handle such mistakes, and taking it public could interfere with that. \n\nThe sister is a minor, so the author is acting on her behalf. The family's frustration is understandable given the emotional impact on the sister. However, using social media to expose the emails might not be the best approach. Instead, maybe contacting the university's administration directly first would be more appropriate. \n\nBut in cases like these, sometimes public pressure is necessary when institutions don't take responsibility. The author might feel that the university isn't taking it seriously, so publicizing it is a way to get attention. However, the line between accountability and privacy is a thin one. \n\nI think there's a balance here. If the author's intent is purely to inform others and prevent similar issues, there's an argument for their side. But if the method of sharing private emails invades the coach's privacy without giving him a chance to respond or correct the situation, that's where the potential wrongdoing comes in. \n\nThe coach did admit fault, so maybe the author could have focused on the university's overall handling of the mistake rather than publishing personal emails. But since the emails were the evidence, they needed to be shared to tell the story accurately. \n\nIn the end, while the coach made a mistake, the author's publicizing of the emails might not be entirely wrong if done with the right intentions and to prevent future harm. But it's a bit of a grey area. However, given the context of trying to protect their sister and seek accountability, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
