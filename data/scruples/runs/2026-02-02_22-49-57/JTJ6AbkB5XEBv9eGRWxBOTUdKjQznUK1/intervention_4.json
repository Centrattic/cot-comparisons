I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for making the email exchange public. The situation involves the sister getting falsely told she was accepted to a university through a mistake by the coach. The author took screenshots of the email thread and posted them on social media to highlight the university's error and to share their sister's experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the coach made a mistake that caused the sister significant emotional distress. The family might feel the need to expose this to prevent others from going through the same. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning or hold the university accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, releasing private correspondence without consent can breach privacy. The coach might have intended to correct the mistake, and public shaming could have consequences beyond just the family's grievance. The other students' arguments that the author is wrong to do this might stem from protecting the coach or the university's reputation, possibly fearing similar actions from others.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to inform the public about a mistake that affected their sister, potentially to prevent future issues. However, the method involved sharing private emails, which could be seen as invasive. The question is whether the public disclosure was necessary and justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if the family had already communicated their concerns to the university and the coach, perhaps a public exposure wasn't necessary. But if they felt unheard, going public might be a form of protest. However, the line between advocacy and privacy violation is thin here. The coach's error is unfortunate, but the author's action could be viewed as crossing into public shaming, which might not be the appropriate recourse.\n\nSo, considering the balance between accountability and privacy, the author might be in the wrong for sharing private emails without consent, even if the intent was to highlight a mistake. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
