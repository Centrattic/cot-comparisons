I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange. \n\nFirst, the situation: the sister received an email from the coach thinking she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family is upset, and the author posted the emails online to raise awareness.\n\nThe key points here are the coach's error and the author's response. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, which caused emotional distress. The author's action was to publicize the emails to highlight the issue and prevent others from similar experiences.\n\nNow, considering ethics and legality. Publicly sharing someone's private emails without consent is generally a breach of privacy. Even if the intent is to expose a mistake, the coach might have a right to privacy regarding the emails. However, the coach's error caused harm, so there's a balance between accountability and privacy.\n\nThe author's intent was to inform others and hold the university accountable. But did they have the right to share private correspondence? It might depend on local laws\u2014some places have strict privacy protections. Ethically, even if the coach is at fault, publicly sharing the emails could be seen as retaliatory and potentially harmful to the coach or the university's reputation, even if the family believes it's justified.\n\nAlso, the swimmers and others at the university are defending the coach, suggesting a community impact. The author's action could be seen as necessary for transparency, but it's a gray area. The answer might hinge on whether the public sharing was proportionate to the harm caused by the coach's mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coach's error was inexcusable, the author's decision to leak the emails might be considered a breach of privacy, making them at least partially at fault. But if it's in the public interest to expose systemic issues in college admissions, it could be justified. However, legally and ethically, sharing private emails without consent is generally wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
