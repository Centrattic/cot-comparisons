I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about their sister's situation is in the wrong for publicly sharing emails between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister got a false acceptance from the coach, which led to her being devastated. The family is upset, and the author shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue and prevent it from happening to others.\n\nNow, considering the action taken\u2014posting the emails on social media. Is that a breach of privacy? The emails are between the sister and the coach. By sharing them, the author might be violating their sister's privacy, even if with good intentions. However, the sister might have given consent implicitly if she was aware of the sharing.\n\nAnother angle: Defamation. The coach admitted to a mistake. If the emails are shared without malicious intent, but the author is trying to expose a systemic issue, maybe it's within the bounds of free speech. But if the sharing is done without consent, it could be a privacy issue.\n\nAlso, the coach's side: He made an error, but there's a possibility of reputational damage here. The author is using the emails to support their sister's case, but others (students at the university) are defending the coach. The author argues that the swimmers are biased.\n\nEthically, the author wants to raise awareness, which is a public interest argument. But legally, sharing private emails can be problematic unless it's for a legitimate purpose like exposing wrongdoing. The coach's mistake might not be a major scandal, but it's a personal error. \n\nHowever, the sister's emotional distress is significant. The author's action is to draw attention to the university's handling, which could be seen as holding them accountable. But is it justified to use public shaming? It's a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, sharing private information without consent can be considered a violation of privacy, even if the intent is noble. The author might not be in the wrong morally if the purpose is to highlight a systemic issue, but legally, they could be at risk. \n\nBut since the question is about whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral or ethical judgment rather than legal. The author's intent is to prevent similar issues, so some might argue it's justified. Others might say that the sister's privacy was compromised. \n\nGiven the emotional impact on the sister and the intent to expose a mistake that affected a student-athlete, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the act of publicizing private emails without explicit consent could be seen as unethical. \n\nBut the coach admitted to the mistake, so the author's sharing might be to ensure transparency. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to raise awareness and the coach's error was acknowledged.\n"
