I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by sharing the email thread between their sister and the coach on social media. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The sister applied to a university, got an email from the head coach saying they were accepted and interested in her joining the team. The family got excited, but later the sister found out she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted he made a mistake by emailing the wrong people, mixing up those who applied with those accepted. The author then shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue, but some people, especially students from the university, are upset saying it's wrong.\n\nSo the key points here are: Did the author have the right to share those emails publicly?\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the content of the emails. The coach sent an email that was misleading, thinking it was an accepted student. The family was misled, and the sister was hurt. The author's intention was to bring attention to the mistake and possibly prevent others from going through the same thing.\n\nBut, sharing emails without consent... is that okay? In most places, sharing someone's private communications without their permission can be a breach of privacy. Even if the content is about a mistake or wrongdoing, the act of publishing private emails might have legal and ethical implications. The coach might have a case here for invasion of privacy or defamation, depending on the context. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument of free speech and public interest. If the situation is about a systemic issue in admissions, and the author is trying to inform others, maybe it's justified. But the sister's privacy is also a factor. Did she agree to the emails being shared? The author acted on her behalf, but the sister might not have given consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach made a mistake that caused emotional distress, and the author's action could be seen as an attempt to hold them accountable. But the method of public shaming through social media might be crossing a line. There's a balance between accountability and respecting privacy.\n\nAlso, considering the people who are upset, like the students on the team, they might feel the coach is being unfairly targeted, but they might also be in denial about the issue. The author's perspective is that they're protecting their sister and highlighting a problem.\n\nSo, ethically, is the author in the wrong? If the emails were shared without consent, even if the intention is good, the action might be considered wrong. But if the intention is to expose a mistake that affected their sister and others, maybe it's justified. Legally, it's a gray area. But in terms of social morals, sharing private emails can be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the reason. The answer might depend on whether the author had the right to share the emails. Since the sister is a minor (assuming she's a senior in high school), maybe the family has some authority, but that's not necessarily a legal or ethical justification for publicizing the emails.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for sharing the emails without consent, even if the intention was to expose a mistake. The right to privacy is important, and the author's action could have repercussions. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
