I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the sister getting an email from a coach saying she was accepted, only for it to be a mistake. The author then published the email thread publicly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The coach made an error by sending an acceptance email when she wasn't actually accepted. This caused emotional distress to the sister. The author's action was to put the email thread online to share their story and raise awareness about the university's mishandling.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the coach's mistake was a clear error in communication. The author's intention was to bring attention to the university's mistake and prevent others from going through the same issue. However, publishing emails without the involved parties' consent could be problematic. There's a line between exposing a mistake for accountability and violating privacy or trust.\n\nBut wait, the emails were between the sister and the coach. If the sister shared them with the author, the author might have the right to share them, especially if they were part of the communication. However, the coach might have expected some level of privacy in his communications. The author's action could be seen as a form of calling out the university's negligence, but it's possible that the emails contain personal or sensitive information that wasn't meant for public view.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister was a student-athlete, and the coach's mistake might have had a significant impact on her college and swimming career. The author's goal was to advocate for their sister and raise awareness. But the people who criticized them, like the current swimmers, might feel that the author is damaging the coach's reputation or the school's image without knowing the full context.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations come into play here. Publicly sharing someone's emails without consent could be considered a breach of privacy, but if the emails are part of a public issue (like college admissions practices), there might be a public interest defense. However, in many cases, sharing private communications without permission is generally frowned upon unless there's a compelling reason, like exposing wrongdoing.\n\nIn this case, the coach admitted fault, so the author's action might be seen as justified to hold the university accountable. However, the method of sharing via social media might be seen as unprofessional or harsh. The key is whether the author's intention was to inform the public about a systemic issue versus just seeking revenge or personal gain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by publishing the emails, even if the intention was good. There could be a better way to address the issue, like contacting the university directly or reporting it to a higher authority, instead of making it public. Public shaming or exposure can sometimes escalate the situation and may not be the most effective way to resolve it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as a gray area. The coach's mistake was real, but the method of addressing it publicly might not be the right approach. However, the author's goal was to prevent others from experiencing the same problem. Depending on one's perspective, the author could be seen as justified in wanting to expose the mistake to protect other students, or as violating privacy and escalating the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author shared the emails without the coach's consent, even if the intention was good, it's possible that they did cross a line. The answer might depend on the specific laws and norms around sharing private communications. In many cases, sharing someone's private emails without permission can be considered a breach of privacy, even if the content is about a genuine mistake.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they publicly shared private correspondences without the involved parties' consent, even if their intentions were to expose a mistake. The right approach would have been to address the issue through appropriate channels rather than making it public for social media attention.\n"
