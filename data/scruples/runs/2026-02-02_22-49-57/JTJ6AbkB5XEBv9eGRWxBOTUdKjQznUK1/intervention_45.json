I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for posting the emails publicly. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's sister is a high school senior applying to college, and the head swim coach at her dream school mistakenly told her she was accepted. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending the email to the wrong person. The author took screenshots and posted them on social media to highlight the university's failure and to ensure others know what happened. Some people, especially students from the university's swim team, are saying the author did wrong by publicizing the emails.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the coach's error, the family's distress, and the author's response. The coach made a mistake, which caused the sister emotional harm. The author wants to bring attention to this so it doesn't happen again. But sharing the emails publicly could be seen as exposing private communications, which might have privacy concerns. \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for wanting to prevent similar situations. The coach's error was significant and affected a student's college process, leading to emotional distress. Publicizing the emails might hold the university accountable and serve as a warning. On the other hand, sharing private emails without permission is generally considered a breach of privacy. Even if the intent is good, releasing personal communications can be seen as public shaming or invasion of privacy for the coach and perhaps the university. \n\nThe coach admitted fault, but the author's action could damage the coach's reputation or the university's. The university might have policies against such public disclosures. Also, the siblings involved might not have consented to their personal information being shared. While the sister is upset, the author's decision to post the emails could be seen as using her sister's pain for public criticism, which might be ethically questionable.\n\nHowever, the situation is also about a serious mistake that caused real harm. The author's intention is to protect other students, which is a noble cause. But the method of sharing private information without consent could be problematic. There might be a balance between accountability and respecting privacy. The coach should have been more careful, but the author's action might be crossing a line by making the emails public, even if the intention is good.\n\nIn some cases, whistleblowing is protected, but this seems more like a personal grievance. The author might not be in the wrong because the coach's mistake was significant and caused real harm, but they might also be in the wrong for breaching privacy. It's a tough call. The answer depends on weighing the intention (protecting others) against the method (publicizing private info). In many cases, sharing private emails without consent is considered wrong, regardless of the intent. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. However, I need to decide between A or B based on the scenario.\n"
