I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister was tricked into thinking she got into her dream school because the coach sent her an acceptance email, but it was actually a mistake. Then the author publicized the emails on social media to show the university's mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to share those emails. The coach made an error, but the emails were between the coach and the sister. By putting them public, the author might be exposing someone's mistake, but is that justified? The sister was emotionally hurt, and the author wanted to make sure others know this could happen to others. But maybe the author should have taken another approach, like contacting the university directly or using official channels instead of social media. \n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, so maybe the author's public shaming is excessive. However, the coach's mistake had a real impact on the student's well-being. The author's intention was to prevent other students from going through the same thing. But publicizing personal emails can lead to privacy issues and potential defamation if the context isn't clear. \n\nThere's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author might have valid reasons to want transparency, but the method used could be problematic. The people who responded on social media, like the swimmers, might be defending the coach, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. However, the author's action could have violated the coach's privacy or the sister's privacy if the emails were personal. \n\nIn some cases, sharing such information could be seen as a form of vigilantism. The appropriate steps might involve reporting to the university's administration first. The author's public post might have been a way to get attention, but it's possible that the right approach is through official channels. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action might be seen as crossing a line, even though they had a good intention. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the public shaming served a greater good of accountability, maybe B (No). It's a tough call. But usually, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic regardless of intent. So leaning towards A.\n"
