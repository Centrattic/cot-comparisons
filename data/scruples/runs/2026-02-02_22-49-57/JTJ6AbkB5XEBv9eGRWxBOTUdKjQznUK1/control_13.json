I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email thread between their sister and the swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was led to believe she was accepted into her dream school by the coach's email, but it was a mistake. The coach sent the email to applicants instead of those accepted. The family was thrilled, then devastated when the official letter didn't come. The author then shared the email thread publicly to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same mistake.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The coach made an error, and the family is upset. The author's intention was to hold the university accountable and raise awareness. But sharing emails without consent might be a privacy issue. \n\nOn one hand, the family has a right to be upset and want to prevent similar situations. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a form of holding the coach and university accountable, especially if they made a mistake that affected a student's future. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing private communications publicly might be a breach of privacy, even if the intent is noble. The coach might have a different perspective, and the university might feel that airing this publicly could damage their reputation. Also, the other students mentioned (the swimmers) argue that the author is wrong to do this, possibly because it could affect their team's reputation or their own standing.\n\nI should consider the potential consequences. If the author's actions led to public shaming or harmed the coach's career inappropriately, that could be problematic. But if the goal was to bring attention to a systemic issue in college admissions, maybe it's justified. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author gave the university a chance to address the issue privately before going public. If the family tried to resolve it through proper channels and the university didn't respond adequately, then publicizing might be a last resort. However, if they didn't give the university a chance, it might be seen as premature.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the sister's distress is significant. The author wanted to support their sister and prevent others from similar experiences. That's understandable. But the method chosen involves sharing private emails, which could be seen as crossing a line, even if the cause is sympathetic.\n\nIn some cases, public shaming can lead to real change, but it can also lead to legal issues or escalate conflicts. The coach apologized, but the family might feel that the apology isn't enough. The key here is whether sharing the emails was a reasonable response.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author's intentions are good, but the method might be questionable. However, if the family felt they weren't getting the support they needed from the university, publicizing the issue could be a way to get attention. But it's possible that the author should have first tried to resolve it through proper channels, like contacting the admissions office or the university's administration, before going public. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, privacy is important. Even if the emails were shared with the sister's consent, the coach's side might not have agreed. The author might not have considered the coach's perspective or the university's policies on such matters. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author acted responsibly. If they had no other recourse and the university refused to address the issue, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they skipped over proper channels and just went public, that could be problematic. The fact that the sister was emotionally affected adds weight to the author's argument, but the method of public shaming could still be seen as excessive. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both. The author is justified in wanting to bring attention to the mistake, but the method might not be appropriate. However, given the context of college admissions stress and the coach's error, some might see it as justified. It's a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the intent was to prevent harm to others, even if the method was questionable.\n"
