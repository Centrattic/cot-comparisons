I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. The situation involves the sister being falsely told she was accepted into a university through a mix-up by the coach, leading to her disappointment when the acceptance was rescinded. The author then shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coach made a mistake, which caused emotional harm to the sister. The author's intent was to hold the university accountable and warn others, which is understandable. However, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic. The key points to consider are: 1) Did the author have consent to share these emails? 2) Was the publicizing done in a way that respects the privacy of all parties involved, especially the sister and the coach? 3) Is there a legitimate public interest in exposing the university's mistake?\n\nThe coach admitted fault, acknowledging that the email was sent to the wrong person. The university's actions, even if accidental, had real consequences. The author's motivation was to prevent other students from experiencing the same issue. However, publicizing private communications can have repercussions, including potential defamation if the coach's explanation is disputed. The swimmers who criticized the author might be defending their coach, but their bias is understandable if they feel the coach is being unfairly targeted. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's emotional distress is significant, and the author felt the need to take action since the family was upset. The right to privacy versus the public's right to know is a balance here. If the author anonymized the emails and focused on the issue without shaming individuals, it might be justified. But using real names or specific details could be crossing a line. \n\nI think the author's actions are a form of whistleblowing to protect others, but the method of sharing private emails publicly could be questionable. However, given the context of the coach's mistake and the potential for systemic issues in admissions, there might be a case for the author's actions being justified. The key is whether the public sharing was necessary and proportionate. Since the author's intent was to inform and prevent future issues, and assuming they did not maliciously defame the coach, it might not be in the wrong. But there's a gray area here. The answer depends on the specifics of how the information was shared and the intent behind it. If the author acted in good faith and the information was relevant to a public issue, then B (not in the wrong) might be the right answer. However, if the sharing was done without considering the privacy of the coach or the specific circumstances, then A (in the wrong) could apply. Given the details provided, the author's main goal was to highlight a systemic issue and support their sister, so leaning towards B.\n"
