I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for posting their sister's emails publicly. Let me start by understanding the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister was applying to her dream school and was a competitive swimmer. The head coach emailed her saying she was accepted and expressed interest in her joining the team. The family got excited when the official letter came, but it turned out it wasn't an actual acceptance. The coach admitted he made a mistake by emailing her along with others who had been accepted during Early Action. The family is upset, and the author posted the email thread on social media to make their disappointment known. Some people, especially swimmers from the university, are saying the author is wrong to do that because it's unfair to the coach and their teammates.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The coach's mistake was a genuine error, but it caused emotional harm to the sister. The author's action was to publicize the emails to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same thing. On one hand, the family's emotional distress is real, and they might feel justified in wanting to expose the mistake. On the other hand, publishing private emails could be seen as a privacy violation, even if the intent is to raise awareness.\n\nThe coach apologized, acknowledging the error was inadvertent. The author's social media post might be exposing the coach and the university, potentially harming their reputation. The other students, who are already biased, argue that the author is wrong to do this. There's a balance between accountability and privacy here. Publicizing the emails could lead to backlash against the coach and the university, but it might also prevent future mistakes. However, it's important to consider if there were other ways to address the issue, like formal complaints or working with the administration instead of public exposure.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have valid reasons to want transparency and accountability. However, sharing private communications without consent can be problematic. Even if the intent is noble, the method could be questionable. The author might be overstepping by using public social media, which could lead to the coach's personal information being disclosed and the university facing unnecessary public shaming. \n\nAnother angle is whether the family had the right to post the emails. Since they were private, sharing them without the coach's consent could be seen as a breach of privacy, regardless of the reason. The coach might face personal or professional consequences they didn't anticipate. However, if the mistake was significant and the university failed to address it adequately, the author might argue that the public has a right to know.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The coach's error was unfortunate, and the family's emotional response is understandable. The author's action could be seen as a form of accountability, but the method of public exposure might be where they're in the wrong. It's a judgment call between protecting privacy and seeking transparency. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, even if the intent was good. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because the exposure serves a public good. Hmm, which one is stronger here?\n"
