He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his game, WoW, and the author ends up cooking for both after a fight. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a student with six exams in the next eight days, one the next day. That's a high-pressure situation. It's reasonable for them to want to focus on studying. Cooking can take time, and if the author is busy, delegating that task makes sense. However, the boyfriend is also stressed about his own important week in the game. If he's committed to playing during this time, maybe he expects the author to handle cooking. \n\nBut the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author asked for help to study, which is a valid request. The boyfriend's reaction being so intense that he's scaring her isn't healthy. Relationships require compromise, and if the boyfriend is unwilling to help and instead becomes angry, that's a problem. The author then taking over cooking after he got upset might be a sign that he's not respecting her needs. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author feels scared when he's mad is a red flag. Emotional distress and fear in a relationship are serious issues. Even if both have their own priorities, handling conflicts without causing fear is crucial. \n\nSo, while both have valid stressors, the way the boyfriend reacted and the author's safety in the relationship are important. The author isn't wrong for needing help with exams, and the boyfriend's response is more concerning. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
