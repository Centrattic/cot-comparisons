      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author, a female in a relationship with a male who's 3 years older, wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers a crucial time. The author ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend is mad, and she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has exams, which are really important for her academic future. Sacrificing study time for something else, even if it's a game, might be justified. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own priorities with the game, which he's treating seriously. But the key point here is that the author felt she had to cook herself because he wouldn't help, and he got angry. She even mentions he's scaring her when he's mad. \n\nNow, relationships require mutual support. If the boyfriend is upset about not being able to help with cooking because he's playing the game, he might need to consider that her exams are more critical. However, if he's being unreasonable and causing conflict, that's a problem. The fact that she's now cooking for both to avoid a fight suggests that he wasn't being cooperative. Also, his reaction being so strong that she feels scared is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while both have needs, the author's academic commitments are a major life goal. The boyfriend's gaming, while important to him, shouldn't outweigh her need to study if it's causing conflict. However, communication is key. Maybe they didn't discuss priorities properly. But the boyfriend's anger and her fear indicate he's overreacting. \n\nSo, the author is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook. From an external perspective, it's reasonable for her to ask for help during a stressful time. The boyfriend's refusal and subsequent anger might be where the issue lies. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
