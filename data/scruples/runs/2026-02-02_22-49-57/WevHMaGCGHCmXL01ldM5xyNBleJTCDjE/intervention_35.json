      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so she can study for upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, and now she's cooking for both of them to avoid a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an 18-year-old female with a 21-year-old boyfriend. She has six exams in eight days, one of which is the next day. That's a significant academic pressure. It's reasonable for her to prioritize studying, as exams are critical for her education and future. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in competitive gaming (WoW push week) which is important for him. He's upset that she's asking him to cook during this crucial time. But he's not just cooking; it's about cleaning and plating for both of them. The author felt scared when he was angry, which is a red flag. \n\nThe key points here are priorities and mutual respect. The author has a valid reason to need time to study. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be over the top, especially if he's getting so angry that he's making her scared. Healthy relationships should allow both partners to prioritize their important commitments without undue pressure or fear. \n\nThe author's decision to cook for both to avoid a fight might be a temporary solution, but it shouldn't be expected if the boyfriend's priorities are conflicting. It's possible that the boyfriend isn't respecting her academic needs, which are time-sensitive and critical. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, cooking for oneself is manageable. If the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise or understand her situation, that might indicate a lack of support in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her exams. The boyfriend's reaction and insistence on his gaming schedule over her academic needs might be the real issue here.\n"
