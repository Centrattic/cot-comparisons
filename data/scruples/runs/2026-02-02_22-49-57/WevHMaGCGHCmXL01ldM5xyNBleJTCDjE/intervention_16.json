I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I think is a game. The user ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight.\n\nFirst, the user has six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable they want time to study. The boyfriend is playing a game that he considers very important. But, exams are a real-life commitment affecting their future, while the game is a hobby. \n\nThe user told the boyfriend to let them cook alone because he's scary when mad. That's a red flag. If he's scaring her, that's a bigger issue than the cooking. Maybe he's not respecting her boundaries or her academic priorities. Pushing through to play the game might not be the right choice here. \n\nThe boyfriend expects her to cook for both, but if she's already stressed about exams, maybe he should compromise. But he's not. So the user is taking steps to avoid conflict, which is smart. However, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic if he's making her uncomfortable when angry. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's priorities and his reaction might be the issue. So answer B.\n"
