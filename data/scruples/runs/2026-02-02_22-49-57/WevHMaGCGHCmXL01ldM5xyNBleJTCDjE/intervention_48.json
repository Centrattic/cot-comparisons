I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a critical week for his gaming activities.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up, with one the next day. That's a significant academic commitment. It's reasonable for them to need time to study. Cooking for two might take time away from studying, so asking the boyfriend to handle it seems logical.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers important. However, the importance of a game event compared to someone's exams isn't equal. Exams are time-sensitive and crucial for the author's academic progress, while game events are recreational and recurring.\n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend is scaring them when he's mad. This is a red flag. Emotional distress or fear in a relationship is serious. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, prioritizing gaming over the author's academic needs and causing fear. The author now cooks for both to avoid conflict, which isn't fair because they shouldn't have to accommodate his anger.\n\nThe key points here are the imbalance in priorities and the boyfriend's emotional response. The author isn't wrong for seeking help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic for prioritizing gaming over supporting their partner's academic goals and for creating a hostile environment. The author's decision to handle cooking themselves to avoid a fight shows they're trying to maintain peace, but the root issue is the boyfriend's lack of support and emotional control.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's priorities and reaction are the main issues here.\n"
