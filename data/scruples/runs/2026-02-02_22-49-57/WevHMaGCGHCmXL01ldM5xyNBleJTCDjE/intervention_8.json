I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a critical week for his gaming (\"push week in WoW\"). The author ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight and mentions the boyfriend is scary when angry.\n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable. They have six exams in eight days, which is a lot of pressure. Asking for help with cooking, a daily chore, to focus on studying makes sense. Prioritizing education is important, especially with exams coming up.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is more intense. He's \"super mad\" and insists it's one of the most important weeks in the game. While gaming can be a priority for some, it's a hobby, whereas exams are a significant academic commitment. The fact that the author is sacrificing their own study time to cook for both because of his anger suggests he might be overreacting. His behavior of being scary when angry is a red flag, indicating possible emotional abuse or manipulation.\n\nThe key here is balance and mutual respect in the relationship. Both should support each other's priorities. The author's need to study is time-sensitive and critical for their academic success. The boyfriend's gaming, while important to him, isn't as time-sensitive and shouldn't override the author's academic obligations without mutual consideration.\n\nAdditionally, the author is taking responsibility by cooking for both to avoid conflict, but this shouldn't mean they have to sacrifice their own needs. Healthy relationships involve compromise and understanding each other's stress points. The boyfriend's refusal to accommodate the author's request during a crucial time might indicate he's not supportive, which is a problem on his part.\n\nSo, the author's request is valid. They're not in the wrong for needing help during a stressful exam period. The boyfriend's overreaction and inability to manage his own priorities without causing conflict place the blame more on him. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
