I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (F18) wanting her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his WoW (World of Warcraft) game. The girl ended up cooking for both, but he was mad, and she felt scared when he was angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams in the next eight days, one even tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable she wants to focus on studying. Asking her partner to help with cooking could be a way to manage her time. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in the middle of a major game event (\"push week\"), which might be important to him. However, the girl mentioned that cleaning and plating take time, so maybe he's not just playing but also cooking.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The girl is asking for help during a stressful time, which is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction being extreme (mad, causing her to feel scared) is a red flag. Relationships should support each other's needs. If he's prioritizing a game over her exams, that might be a problem. Also, if his anger is making her feel unsafe, that's a bigger issue than who cooks dinner.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girl wanted help to study, which is a valid request. The boyfriend not being able to handle that and getting angry might indicate he's not being supportive. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). Her needs are valid, and his reaction is more concerning.\n"
