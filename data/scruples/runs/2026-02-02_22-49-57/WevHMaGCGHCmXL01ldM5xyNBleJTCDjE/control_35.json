      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (F18) wants their boyfriend (M21) to cook so they can study for upcoming exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW (World of Warcraft), a game, and the author now cooks for both of them to avoid a fight. The author mentions that the boyfriend gets scary when he's mad and that he can't miss the game event for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author has a valid reason: preparing for six exams in eight days, one happening tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure, and it's reasonable to ask for help with daily tasks like cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also stressed about his game event, which he considers important. However, the key points here might be about communication and mutual support in a relationship.\n\nThe author is trying to prioritize their academic responsibilities, which are crucial for their future. It's not uncommon for couples to help each other with chores, especially when one is under academic stress. The boyfriend's reaction being \"super mad\" and the author feeling scared when he's angry suggests that there might be an issue with how he handles stress or conflict. Healthy relationships involve compromise, and if one partner is in a critical period (exams), the other should support them as best as possible.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend might feel that his game event is equally important, but the author's exams are time-sensitive and have a direct impact on their future. The boyfriend being \"scary\" when mad is a red flag. It's important to note that the author is now cooking for both to avoid conflict, which might indicate a power imbalance or lack of effective communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate their needs. The author's request is reasonable, and the boyfriend's anger seems disproportionate. The fact that the author is scared when he's mad is a bigger issue, as it affects their well-being. The boyfriend should be supportive, even if his own priorities are important. However, the author might need to address the boyfriend's behavior beyond just the cooking issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction and behavior are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
