      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is that a female 18-year-old (F18) is asking her boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days. He's upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is important for him. Now she's cooking for both to avoid a fight, but he's still mad. She mentioned that he was scaring her when he's angry and told him to let her handle it. He argues that it's one of the most important weeks in the game and couldn't miss it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility, priorities, and communication. The author is a student with a heavy academic workload, needing time to prepare for exams. Her boyfriend is upset because he has a significant event in his gaming schedule. The question is whether her request is unreasonable.\n\nCooking is a household chore. In a relationship, it's common for partners to share responsibilities. However, the author is facing a critical period with exams, which are important for her future. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is prioritizing a game event, which is a personal interest. It seems like the author is asking for a temporary shift in responsibilities to manage her stress. The boyfriend's reaction being so intense that she feels scared is a red flag. Healthy relationships require respect and support, even if priorities differ.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's important for a few hours might be valid for him, but if he's unwilling to compromise or support her during this stressful time, it could indicate a problem. The author isn't asking for a long-term change, just during her exam period. Since cooking is a shared responsibility, it's not entirely her burden to take on. Also, if his anger is causing her distress, that's a significant issue regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's balancing her academic needs, and it's reasonable to ask for help with chores during a stressful time. Her boyfriend should be more understanding and supportive. The fact that he's so upset that she feels scared suggests that he's being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
