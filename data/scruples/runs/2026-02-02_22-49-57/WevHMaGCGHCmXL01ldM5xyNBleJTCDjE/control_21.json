I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer (F18) wants their boyfriend (M21) to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one happening tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, and now the writer ends up cooking for both, causing a fight. She mentioned he's scary when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The writer is stressed with exams, which are important for their academic future. It's reasonable to ask a partner for help with chores to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend has commitments with his game, which he considers important. However, asking someone to cook once in a while isn't unreasonable, especially when balancing responsibilities. The key point is whether the request is fair and if the boyfriend's reaction is proportionate.\n\nThe writer's request is for a few hours of his time, which he refuses, leading to a situation where she has to cook for both. The fact that he's angry enough to make her feel scared is a red flag. Emotional or verbal abuse isn't acceptable, regardless of the situation. The boyfriend's reaction seems to cross a line by making her feel scared, which is not okay. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend's priorities might be valid, his reaction is inappropriate. The writer isn't in the wrong for asking for help, especially when it's to focus on exams. The boyfriend's response and behavior are more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
