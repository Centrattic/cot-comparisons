I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams, while the boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW. \n\nFirst, the user is a female, 18, and the boyfriend is male, 21. The main issue is about responsibilities and time management. The user has six exams in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure, so she wants him to handle cooking to focus on studying. However, he's upset because he's in his most important week for the game, which he can't miss. \n\nThe user mentions that she eventually told him to stop helping because he was scaring her when he was angry. She now cooks for both. The key points here are mutual responsibilities and communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance each other's needs. The boyfriend might feel that his gaming commitments are as important as her exams. But exams are time-sensitive and critical for her academic future. However, the boyfriend's reaction led to the situation where he was scaring her, which is a red flag. \n\nThe user isn't wrong for needing support during a high-stress period. However, maybe there was a lack of communication about the importance of her exams versus his gaming push. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, maybe both sides should have adjusted. But since the exams are imminent and only a few days away, the immediate need for study time is significant. \n\nThe boyfriend's anger and the fact that he made her feel scared is a major issue. Even if his reason is important, his response was inappropriate. The user standing up for herself by saying he was scaring her is justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction and the lack of mutual understanding are more to blame. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
