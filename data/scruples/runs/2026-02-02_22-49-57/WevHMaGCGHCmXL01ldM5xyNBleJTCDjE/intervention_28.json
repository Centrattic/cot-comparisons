      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is 21. She wants him to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams. The exams are in the next 8 days, with one the next day. The boyfriend is really mad because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I know is a game, so probably a big event. They ended up fighting, and now the author is cooking for both to avoid conflict. She mentioned that when he's mad, he scares her, and he said it's one of the most important weeks in the season, so he can't miss it for a few hours (for cooking, cleaning, plating).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if AITA says the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author is stressed about exams and needs time to study. She asked her boyfriend to cook, which is a reasonable request. However, he's upset because of his gaming commitments. The boyfriend is prioritizing the game over helping her with cooking. The author then says he scares her when he's mad, which adds a layer of emotional distress. She ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about priorities and compromise. The author has a valid reason to need help with cooking (exams). The boyfriend's priority is gaming. However, he's not just refusing to help; he's getting angry and making her feel scared. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual support and understanding. If his gaming is causing him to be abusive or inconsiderate, that's his issue. The author is trying to manage her responsibilities and mental health, which is important.\n\nBut, maybe there's an expectation in their relationship about sharing chores. If the boyfriend usually does the cooking and she's asking him to do it now, but he's resistant because of his own priorities, it's a conflict of needs. However, his reaction seems extreme, especially to the point of her feeling scared. That's not okay. The fact that she's now cooking for both to avoid conflict shows she's trying to maintain peace, but it's not fair if he's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's prioritizing her education and seeking help, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, especially his anger and lack of support. So the answer should be B.\n"
