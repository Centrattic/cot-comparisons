      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams, but the boyfriend is upset because it's push week in WoW. The author ended up cooking for both and said the boyfriend scares them when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a lot of exams coming up, including one the next day. That's a significant academic pressure. It's reasonable to want support during such a stressful time. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is important to him, and he's upset that they can't spend time on that. But the author is now cooking for both, which might not be fair.\n\nThe key points here are the balance of responsibilities and mutual support in a relationship. The author is trying to manage their academic responsibilities, which are critical for their future. The boyfriend is upset about missing out on important gaming time, but that's a hobby, while exams are a major academic commitment. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction seems to escalate the situation by getting angry and scared the author. Emotional harm is a big issue here. The author mentioned being scared when the boyfriend is angry, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's anger is problematic. But the author is also asking if they're in the wrong for wanting support. The author isn't wrong for needing help during exams. But maybe there's a communication issue. They could have discussed the situation earlier to find a compromise. However, the main issue seems to be the boyfriend's reaction and the fact that he's prioritizing gaming over supporting the author during exams. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the blame isn't entirely on the author. The boyfriend's anger and the fear aspect make it more about his behavior rather than the author's request for help. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
