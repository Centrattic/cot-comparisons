I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams, but he's upset because it's a big week for his game, WoW. They ended up cooking for both after an argument. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl is stressed with six exams in eight days, one the next day. She wants him to cook so she can study. He's upset because \"push week\" in WoW is important. They had a fight, and now she's cooking for both, but he's mad. She mentioned he scares her when angry.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, exams are a big deal, especially with the time crunch. It's reasonable to ask for help with household tasks to focus on studying. On the other hand, he's also dealing with an important game event. The problem might be communication. Did she ask him to cook, and he refused? If he agreed and then got angry, maybe that's an issue. Also, she said he scares her when mad, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. Maybe he's overreacting or not prioritizing her needs appropriately. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. If she's asking for help and he's not being supportive, maybe he's the one at fault. But the question is if she is in the wrong. Since she's trying to manage her exams and asked for help, she's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
