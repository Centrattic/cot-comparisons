      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a female in a relationship with a male who's 21. She has six exams coming up in the next eight days, with one the next day. She wants him to cook so she can study. But he's really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I know is a game where certain events or updates happen during specific weeks. He's mad because he can't take time off from the game for a few hours to cook, and now she ends up cooking for both of them. She also mentions that he scares her when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is dealing with a major academic deadline, which is a significant stressor. Exams can be life-changing, and preparing for six of them in a short time is a lot. It's reasonable for her to ask for support, like having her partner cook so she can study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in a game event that he considers important. However, the fact that he's so upset that the author now has to cook for both of them suggests a lack of communication or compromise.\n\nThe key points here are the importance of the exams versus the game event. Exams are critical for her future, while a game event, though important to him, doesn't have the same long-term impact. The author is prioritizing her responsibilities, which is understandable. However, if the boyfriend isn't willing to make a compromise, even for a few hours, that could indicate a problem in the relationship. Additionally, the fact that he's \"super mad\" to the point of scaring her is concerning. That behavior might be more about his own priorities than the actual cooking. \n\nAlso, the author stepped back and started cooking for both when he was angry, which might indicate a pattern where she's giving in to avoid conflict. Healthy relationships require mutual support and understanding. If he's not willing to support her during a crucial time, that's a red flag. However, maybe he feels his time in the game is equally important, but it's about balancing both their needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for wanting support during her exams. It's reasonable to ask for help. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive if the cooking is a manageable task that could be shared or adjusted. The fact that she's now doing all the cooking because he's upset suggests he's not being supportive when she needs it most. Also, the mention of him scaring her when mad is a serious issue. Respect and support in a relationship are two-way streets. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's inability to compromise and his anger are more indicative of his issues rather than hers. The exams are a significant life event, and she's prioritizing her responsibilities, which is expected and necessary. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from entitlement or poor communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
