I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a female (F18) and her boyfriend (M21) is getting angry because she wants him to cook while she studies for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I assume is a game. The author ended up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight and mentioned that the boyfriend's anger is scaring her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason to need time to study for exams. It's a high-pressure situation with upcoming exams, which are important for her academic future. Asking a partner for help with cooking during this time seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a game event that he considers very important. However, cooking for dinner is a short task, maybe an hour or two at most. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive if he's refusing to help with something that could support his partner's studies.\n\nThe fact that the author is scared when he's angry is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. The boyfriend not being willing to compromise here might indicate a lack of support. The author cooking for both to avoid conflict shows she's trying to maintain peace, but she shouldn't have to sacrifice her own needs. The exams are a time-sensitive, critical task, whereas a game event, while important to him, isn't as urgent as someone's education. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's argument about missing a few hours for cooking doesn't hold much weight if he's prioritizing the game over supporting his partner during a stressful time. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's managing her own responsibilities. So, the boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own priorities and not respecting her needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
