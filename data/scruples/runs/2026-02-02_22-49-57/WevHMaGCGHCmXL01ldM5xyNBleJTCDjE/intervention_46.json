I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, and the author ended up cooking for both, which made the boyfriend mad. The user thinks the author isn't at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has six exams coming up, one the next day, which is a big deal. They might need the time to study, which is a valid reason to ask for help with cooking. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in the middle of \"push week\" in WoW, which he considers really important. He's upset because he can't take a few hours off. \n\nNow, the author said that the boyfriend was mad and they had a fight, so the author started cooking for both. The key point here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Asking a partner for help with household tasks, especially when they have their own commitments, can be a balancing act. The author's exams are time-sensitive and important for their academic future, which might take precedence over the boyfriend's gaming schedule. \n\nHowever, communication is crucial. The boyfriend might feel that his priorities are being dismissed. If the author didn't consider his push week and just assumed he should cook, that could be a problem. But given the urgency of the exams, maybe the author had a valid reason to ask. Also, the author mentioned that the boyfriend's anger was scaring them, which is a red flag for potential emotional issues in the relationship, but that's a different matter.\n\nSo, judging from the situation, the author's request seems reasonable given the exam pressure. The boyfriend's reaction might be excessive, especially if he's prioritizing gaming over helping with basic needs. The author isn't necessarily wrong for needing help to focus on studying. So the answer might be B.\n"
