I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, and he's angry. The author says he's scaring her when he's mad, and now she's cooking for both.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has six exams coming up, one the next day. Studying is crucial, so asking for help with cooking makes sense. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical week for his game, which might be important to him. The key points here are the urgency of the exams versus the importance of the game event.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is causing stress and fear in the author. He's described as being super mad and scaring her. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or aggression, even over minor issues. The fact that she now has to cook for both because of the conflict suggests an imbalance in their ability to compromise.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's need to spend time on the game during this push week might be valid to him, but if he's prioritizing it over supporting his partner during a high-stress time, that's a problem. The author's request for help is reasonable. If he can't adjust, maybe the issue is deeper than just cooking. The fear aspect is significant. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and needing support. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here.\n"
