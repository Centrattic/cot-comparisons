      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old female, wants her 21-year-old boyfriend to cook so she can study for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is important to him. The author ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend is angry. She also mentions he scares her when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid reason: upcoming exams are crucial for her academic success. Time management is key, and delegating cooking to study is reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is important to him, but it's a game, which might be less pressing than academic exams. However, the boyfriend's reaction is intense\u2014he's mad and the author feels scared, which indicates possible issues in their communication or his handling of stress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's request is reasonable given the exam pressure. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he's prioritizing a game over his partner's critical academic period. The fact that the author feels scared when he's angry is a red flag, pointing to potential emotional abuse or unhealthy conflict resolution. The boyfriend's inability to compromise or adjust his schedule to help her during this time might indicate he's not being supportive.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that both have responsibilities. The boyfriend might be under stress from the game, but the author has high-stakes exams. The key here is the balance of support and respect. The author isn't asking for a long time\u2014just a few hours. If the boyfriend can't manage his time to help, that's on him, especially if he's being hostile about it. The author's decision to cook for both to avoid conflict suggests she's trying to maintain peace, but if the boyfriend is reacting with anger that makes her scared, that's a bigger issue than just whose fault it is.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for needing support during exams. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem here. The fact that he's so upset about a game during her exam period shows a lack of prioritization of her academic needs. The emotional distress mentioned (feeling scared) is a significant factor that might indicate a deeper issue in their relationship, but regarding the specific situation, the author's actions are justifiable.\n"
