I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for her six upcoming exams. One is tomorrow, so time is tight. The boyfriend is super mad because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I think is a game they play. The girl ends up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentions that he's scaring her when he's mad and that he said this is one of the most important weeks for the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has exams coming up, which are important for her academic future. She's asking for help with cooking so she can focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in this game event, which he considers important. He might feel that the girl is prioritizing her studies over his important gaming time, which is causing conflict.\n\nBut wait, the girl says she's scared when he's mad. That's a red flag. If he's getting so angry that she feels scared, maybe his reaction is the problem. Even if he's stressed about the game, his response is aggressive, which isn't okay. The girl is trying to set a boundary by saying he needs to let her do it herself, which he's not respecting. \n\nAlso, asking someone to cook for you when you have exams isn't unreasonable. It's a basic domestic task that can take time away from studying. However, the boyfriend is pushing back because of his gaming commitment. But the fact that he's getting so angry and she's scared suggests that he's not handling the situation well. \n\nSo, the girl is asking for help with a legitimate need, and the boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. Therefore, the girl isn't in the wrong here. The problem lies with the boyfriend's response and his ability to manage his own priorities without making her feel unsafe.\n"
