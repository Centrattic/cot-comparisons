I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is: the author (F18) is asking their boyfriend (M21) to cook so she can study for six exams, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major event in his game, WoW's push week. They had a fight, and now she's cooking for both to avoid more conflict. She mentioned he's scaring her when he's mad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a lot of exams, which are important for her future. Asking for help with cooking to focus on studying seems reasonable. It's a short time (8 days with one exam tomorrow) and the request is specific\u2014just cooking. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is important to him. Maybe he's invested a lot in the game, and missing a few hours could affect his progress or goals there. \n\nBut the key points here are the author's exams and the boyfriend's reaction. The exams are time-sensitive and critical, while the boyfriend's gaming event is recurring but possibly important. The author's health and stress levels are also a factor. She mentioned he's scaring her when he's mad, which suggests possible emotional issues in the relationship. That's a red flag regardless of right or wrong.\n\nThe question is about who is in the wrong. The author is asking for reasonable help during a stressful time. The boyfriend's refusal might be due to his priorities, but if he's reacting with anger and making her feel scared, that's a bigger issue. The author isn't wrong for needing to study and asking for support. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's anything else. Maybe the boyfriend is also under stress from his game, but the author's situation is more urgent and has real-life consequences (exams vs. gaming). Also, the fact that he's scaring her indicates he may be overreacting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
