      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author (F18) is in a relationship with a boyfriend (M21). She has six upcoming exams in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. She wants him to cook so she can study. But he's really mad because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I know is a game with events or updates. The boyfriend can't miss it for a few hours to help her cook. Now, the author is cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he's scaring her when he's angry, so she told him to let her do it alone. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a significant academic deadline, which is time-sensitive and important for her future. Having exams the next day is a big deal. She's asking for help with cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in an important in-game event that he can't miss. He's upset because he can't help her, which causes a conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is key here. If he's angry to the point of scaring her, that's a red flag. Emotional safety in a relationship is crucial. If he's being abusive or overly aggressive, then his actions are the issue, not the author's request for help. The author is trying to avoid conflict by taking on the cooking herself, but that shouldn't be the case if he's being unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: cooking is a shared responsibility in some relationships, but it's not an emergency. The boyfriend's push week might be important to him, but it's not a life-or-death situation like the exams. The author has a legitimate reason to need help. The boyfriend's prioritization of the game over helping his partner during a critical time could be seen as selfish or not supportive.\n\nHowever, some might argue that both have their own commitments. The boyfriend might feel that his game activity is important, but that's a personal hobby, whereas the exams are a major academic milestone. The author isn't asking for a huge commitment\u2014just a few hours. The boyfriend's anger and making her feel scared is a bigger issue. The fact that she's now cooking for both to avoid a fight suggests that the conflict is escalating and perhaps the boyfriend isn't being reasonable.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics, usually, the one who is being unreasonable or harmful is the asshole. Here, the boyfriend's anger and making her feel unsafe is a bigger problem. The author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
