I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook while she studies for exams, but he's really upset because it's push week in World of Warcraft. They ended up fighting, and now the author is doing the cooking herself. She mentioned he scares her when he's mad and that he can't miss a few hours for cooking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is preparing for six exams in eight days, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable for her to need time to study. Cooking is a daily chore, so maybe she's just trying to save time. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in an important event in his game, which he considers crucial. He might feel that his time is equally important.\n\nBut wait, the author said he's \"super mad\" and that he's scaring her. That's a red flag. If his anger is making her feel unsafe or uncomfortable, that's a serious issue. The fact that she's now cooking for both after the argument suggests there's some imbalance in their responsibilities. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking him to cook while she studies.\n\nI think it's reasonable to ask a partner to take on a chore, especially when one is under exam stress. But the boyfriend's reaction might be the bigger problem here. If he's unwilling to compromise or is being abusive when upset, that's on him. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing her studies and needing support. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
