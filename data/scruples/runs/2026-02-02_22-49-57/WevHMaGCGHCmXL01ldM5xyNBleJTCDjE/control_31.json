I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl asking her boyfriend to cook instead of her so she can study for her upcoming exams. He's upset because it's a big week for his game, World of Warcraft. Now she's cooking for both to avoid a fight, but he's mad and she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams in eight days, including one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable she wants to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in \"push week\" which he considers crucial for the game. But how important is gaming compared to exams that affect her education and future? \n\nThe girl is asking for support during a stressful time. If the boyfriend is prioritizing gaming over helping her with exams, that might not be supportive. Also, the fact that she feels scared when he's angry is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear. Maybe he's being unreasonable by not letting her cook for herself, especially when she's making an effort to study. \n\nBut wait, she ended up cooking for both, which he might not have expected. Maybe he felt like he had to do his gaming and she's now taking over, causing tension. However, her initial request seems reasonable. She's in a critical period academically. The boyfriend's reaction could be over the top. \n\nThe key points are: her exams are more time-sensitive and impactful on her future, his gaming is a hobby, and the emotional response where she feels scared is a sign of possible issues in the relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help to study. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
