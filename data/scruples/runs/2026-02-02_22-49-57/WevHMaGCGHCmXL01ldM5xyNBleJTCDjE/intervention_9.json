      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a female aged 18, is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend, who is 21, to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one exam the next day. The boyfriend is really upset about this because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, a game, and he considers it very important. To avoid an argument, the author ended up cooking for both of them now.\n\nThe key points here are the author's need to study for exams and the boyfriend's commitment to the game. The author explains that they told the boyfriend to let her handle it alone because he was scaring her when he was angry. He responded by saying it's one of the most important weeks of the season for the game, so he couldn't miss it even for a few hours. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author has a significant academic responsibility with exams starting the next day. It's reasonable for her to need time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in his gaming commitment. The conflict arises from both needing time for their priorities, but the author is trying to manage her responsibilities while the boyfriend is reluctant to let go of his gaming time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's request for the boyfriend to cook is a common household chore division, but the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. The fact that the boyfriend is \"super mad\" and the author feels scared when he's angry suggests that his reaction is excessive or maybe even abusive. The author taking matters into her own hands by cooking for both to avoid conflict might indicate that the boyfriend is not being considerate of her academic needs, which are time-sensitive and important for her future.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend is also trying to prioritize his activities. But when it comes to balancing priorities, academic responsibilities often take precedence over leisure activities, especially when exams are imminent. The boyfriend's insistence on not missing the push week, despite the author's urgent study needs, might show a lack of support or understanding. The fact that the author felt scared when he was angry is a red flag, indicating potential emotional abuse or at least a very poor conflict resolution approach from the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both people have their needs, but the author's situation is more urgent and has long-term implications on her education. The boyfriend's reaction and the emotional distress he causes are more concerning than the initial request. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for needing to study and asking for help with cooking. The boyfriend's behavior and inability to compromise or support her during a critical time is the issue here.\n"
