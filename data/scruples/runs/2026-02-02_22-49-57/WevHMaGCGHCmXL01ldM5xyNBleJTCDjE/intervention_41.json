I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which he considers super important.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a significant academic pressure. The request seems reasonable because preparing for exams is a major responsibility. On the other hand, the boyfriend is into WoW, and he's prioritizing gaming over cooking. \n\nThe user mentions that the author eventually told him to cook alone because he gets scary when angry. That's a red flag. If someone's partner is making them feel scared during an argument, that's a serious issue regardless of the situation. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially if he's not willing to compromise. \n\nCooking a meal isn't an unreasonable task. The boyfriend's insistence on doing it despite it being a shared responsibility could indicate he's not being supportive. The author needs support during a stressful time, and the boyfriend isn't providing it. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author now cooks for both of them after the argument suggests that the initial request wasn't met with understanding. The boyfriend's prioritization of gaming over helping his partner study might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author is asking for help, which is normal. The boyfriend's refusal and aggressive behavior are problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking support during exams. The boyfriend's reaction and lack of support are the main issues here.\n"
