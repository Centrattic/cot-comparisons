I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a female, 18, and her boyfriend is male, 21. She wants him to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one exam tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week for World of Warcraft. The author now cooks for both, but the boyfriend is mad, and she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to think about both sides. The author has a valid reason: preparing for exams is important for her future. She's under a lot of stress with six exams in a short time. It's reasonable to ask for help to manage her time and reduce stress. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also stressed because of the game. But push week in a game might not be as critical as exams for the author's academic future. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction is a problem. If he's getting angry and it's making the author scared, that's a red flag. His anger shouldn't be taken lightly, especially if it's affecting her safety or well-being. The fact that she now cooks for both because of the conflict shows that communication might be an issue. The boyfriend's inability to compromise or support her during this stressful time could indicate that he's not being considerate. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is key. The author isn't being selfish by prioritizing her studies; she's managing her academic responsibilities. The boyfriend, while having his own interests, should be understanding. If he's not able to adjust and instead reacts with anger, that's on him. The author's decision to step back and cook herself to avoid a fight shows she's trying to keep the peace, but it's not fair if the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her education, which is crucial. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here, especially since it's causing her fear. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
