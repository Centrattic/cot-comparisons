I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a female who's 18, wants her boyfriend, who's 21, to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams over the next eight days, one of which is the next day. The boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, and now the author is cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he gets scary when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has exams, which are important for her future. She's asking for help with a basic chore, cooking, which many couples split. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own priorities with the game, which he considers important. But he's getting angry enough that she's scared, which is a red flag. \n\nThe key points here: the author is trying to balance her studies, which are time-sensitive and critical, with household responsibilities. She's asking for support, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, especially if it's making her feel scared. Emotional or physical abuse isn't acceptable, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend should be supportive of her exams, as they're a major life event. Prioritizing a game over his partner's academic needs doesn't seem considerate. However, the author is in a position where she needs to study, so asking for help isn't unreasonable. The fact that he's becoming abusive when angry is more of an issue than the initial request.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for needing help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem here. The answer should be B (No), because the author isn't wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is inappropriate, and the situation highlights a potential issue with his anger management.\n"
