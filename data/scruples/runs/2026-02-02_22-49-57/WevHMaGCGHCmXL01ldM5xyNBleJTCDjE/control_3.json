I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook while they study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for him in WoW (World of Warcraft), a game. The user now cooks for both to avoid a fight, but the BF is mad. The user also mentioned that the BF's anger is scaring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user has six exams coming up, including one the next day, so their studying is a high priority. It's reasonable for them to ask for help with cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the BF is in \"push week,\" which in gaming terms is a critical time, maybe a big update or event. He might feel like he can't miss it for a few hours. However, the BF's reaction is anger, which is causing tension. The user feels scared when he's mad, which is a red flag for possible emotional abuse.\n\nThe user's initial request isn't unreasonable. Balancing responsibilities is part of a relationship. If the BF can't compromise or communicate better, that's his issue. The user standing up for themselves by cooking for both to avoid conflict might be a healthy choice. However, the BF's reaction is problematic if it's making the user feel scared. So the BF's behavior is more concerning here. The user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their studies and needing support. The BF should be understanding and find another way to handle his game time without causing distress. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
