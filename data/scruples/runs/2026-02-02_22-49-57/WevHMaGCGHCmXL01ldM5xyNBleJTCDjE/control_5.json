I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is likely a competitive time for him. The author ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend was angry, and she felt scared.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has six exams in eight days, one the next day. That's a high-pressure situation. It's reasonable for them to need time to study. However, the boyfriend is also stressed about an important game event. The conflict arises from their differing priorities. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme if he's being \"super mad\" and the author feels scared. That's a red flag for possible emotional abuse or overreaction. The author's decision to take over cooking to avoid a fight shows they're trying to be considerate, but maybe the boyfriend isn't respecting her needs. \n\nThe key points are the author's academic deadlines versus the boyfriend's gaming commitments. Both have valid needs, but the boyfriend's anger and the fear it causes suggest he's not handling the situation well. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their exams, especially when their mental health is affected. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
