      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend (M21) and his girlfriend (F18) who's about to have six exams in eight days. She wants him to cook so she can study. But he's really upset because it's a push week in World of Warcraft, which is a significant event for him. They ended up fighting, and now she's cooking for both of them to avoid more conflict. She mentions he gets scary when he's mad, which is a red flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is under academic pressure with exams coming up. It's reasonable to ask for help with daily tasks like cooking to conserve energy for studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is stressed about an important in-game event. However, the key points here are the reaction and the fact that he's scaring her when angry. Emotional harm is a serious issue in relationships. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting him to cook. It's common for partners to help each other with chores, especially during stressful times. However, the boyfriend's response was extreme. The girl is prioritizing her academics, which is a major life aspect, while he's prioritizing a game event. The imbalance here might be on the boyfriend's side, especially since his reaction leads to her feeling scared. \n\nAlso, she asked him to let her cook on her own to avoid conflict, which shows she's trying to de-escalate. His insistence on not missing the game event for a few hours seems less urgent compared to her exams. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support during exams. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, not the author's initial request.\n"
