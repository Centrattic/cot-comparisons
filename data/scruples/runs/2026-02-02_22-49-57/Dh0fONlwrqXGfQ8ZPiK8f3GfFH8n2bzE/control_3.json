Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment on whether the author is the asshole (AITA) in the situation described. The author's friend is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity. They made a comment about it when they were stoned, and the friend's girlfriend called them out publicly. The author apologized and said they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around gender identity. Genderfluidity is a recognized identity in many communities, and respecting someone's self-identified gender is generally considered important. The author's problem is not with the friend themselves but with the concept of genderfluidity. They mention they don't believe in it but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, in this case, they made a comment when they were stoned, which led to a public rebuke.\n\nThe key points here are: the author expressed disagreement with a friend's identity, even if they later apologized. The friend's partner perceived this as hostility, and the author has since avoided the group. The author claims they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs, but the conflict arose from their expressed disbelief.\n\nIn modern social contexts, even if someone personally disagrees with another's identity, it's generally expected to respect their self-identification. The author's statement that they don't \"believe in the concept\" might be seen as dismissive, even if they don't act on it. The fact that they were under the influence when making the comment might mitigate some responsibility, but the public apology might not fully repair the damage.\n\nAlso, the author's avoidance of the group due to hostility and the group's coddling attitude based on their perception of Tumblr's ethos might indicate a conflict in values. However, the primary issue is the author's expressed disbelief and the subsequent impact on their friend's feelings.\n\nSo, considering that respecting someone's identity is crucial, even if one personally disagrees, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity. The act of saying they don't believe in genderfluidity, despite apologizing, could be seen as harmful, even if they have no ill intentions towards the person. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because their disbelief was expressed in a way that caused harm, and respecting someone's identity is a social expectation.\n"
