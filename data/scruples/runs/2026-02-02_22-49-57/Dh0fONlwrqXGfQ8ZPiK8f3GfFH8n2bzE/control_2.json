Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights, but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They mention a situation where a friend is genderfluid, and there's some conflict. The friend's partner in the group sent a message about being supportive, specifically mentioning the author. The author got into a discussion while stoned, apologized, and now feels isolated because the group is too sensitive, comparing them to \"anti-SJW\" types.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. Even though they keep their opinions private, they expressed it once when stoned, which led to tension. The key points here are about respecting others' identities regardless of personal beliefs. The author says they don't oppose equal rights, but their actions (not buying the friend's genderfluidity) might not align with that. The friend in question is changing names and identities, which the author thinks is histrionic.\n\nIn terms of social norms today, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered important. Even if you don't personally agree with the concept, respecting their identity is crucial for maintaining relationships and being a good ally. The author apologized and said they respect their friends, but the act of not \"buying\" the genderfluidity, even if not vocalized much, might still be hurtful. The friend's partner called out the author, which suggests that the group felt disrespected or invalidated by the author's stance, even if it was a private conversation when stoned.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostile could be a reaction to the group's sensitivity, but the root issue is the author's initial statement. The question is whether the author was wrong to express disbelief, even if they later apologized. In many communities, especially those that value social justice, such a stance\u2014even if expressed in a private context\u2014can be seen as harmful. The fact that the group reacted by making jokes comparing the author to \"anti-SJW\" types indicates that they perceive the author's position as opposing their values, which can create division.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention wasn't malicious, the impact of not respecting the friend's identity is significant. The author is in a position where they should prioritize the friend's self-identified gender over their personal disbelief. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because respecting others' identities is a fundamental part of being considerate and maintaining relationships, regardless of personal beliefs.\n"
