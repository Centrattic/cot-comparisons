Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their opinions to themselves except during a specific discussion while stoned. The friend's girlfriend called out the author publicly, and there's some tension in the group because of it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're open-minded and don't oppose equal rights. They even apologized for their comment, which was made under the influence. The key points here are that the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity once, under the influence, then apologized and affirmed respect. However, the friend's partner took offense and the group seems to be treating the author as an antagonist.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is not engaging in hate or discrimination. They're stating a personal belief but also respecting the person's identity. The issue might be that stating disbelief in someone's identity can be hurtful, but the author did apologize. However, the author's actions (avoiding the group) and the group's reaction might contribute to the tension. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force their views on others, apologized, and respects the friend regardless of their beliefs. The friend's partner's public accusation and the group's hostility might be part of why the situation escalated. The author's comment was a personal belief expressed once, not a repeated attack. \n\nIn many cases, expressing skepticism about certain identities can be seen as problematic, especially if it causes harm, but the author here took responsibility. Still, in a supportive group, such a statement might not be as accepted. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit gray. They might have overstepped by expressing disbelief, but they did apologize. However, the friend's partner's public call-out might be more about defensiveness than the author's action. \n\nBut in terms of the question, the author is asking if they are the asshole for not buying the genderfluidity. The answer might hinge on whether expressing personal beliefs (even if they're not believed) without attacking the person is considered wrong. In many social contexts, respecting someone's identity is expected, regardless of personal beliefs. So the author might be in the wrong for not affirming the friend's identity, even if they don't personally believe in the concept. But they also apologized. Hmm. It's tricky. On one hand, they didn't hate the person, just disagreed with the concept. On the other hand, the statement could be hurtful. But the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in a friend's identity, even if they apologized. However, the context is important\u2014apologizing and respecting the person's right to their identity. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to think again.\n\nWait, the question is about the author's responsibility in not buying the friend's genderfluidity. If the friend is genderfluid, then the author's disbelief might be seen as invalidating. Even if they don't act on it, expressing that disbelief can be harmful. The author's statement might be considered harmful even if they apologize later. So, in terms of being an asshole, the initial statement could be the problem. Thus, the answer might be A. However, the author is open to discussion and respects the friend's rights. So perhaps the answer is B. This is really nuanced. I think the key here is that the author didn't attack the person but expressed a belief, then apologized. But in a close-knit group, that might still be seen as offensive. However, the friend's partner's reaction might be part of the issue. The author is not in the wrong if they believe they can express their views while respecting the person. But if expressing disbelief in someone's identity is considered harmful, then A. It's a tough call, but in many modern contexts, affirming someone's identity is expected, even if one personally doesn't agree. So the author's disbelief might be seen as problematic, making them the asshole. So answer A.\n"
