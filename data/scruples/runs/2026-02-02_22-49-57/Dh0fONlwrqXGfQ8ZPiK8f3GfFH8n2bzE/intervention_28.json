Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but tries to keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, they did make a comment while stoned, which led to some conflict with a friend's partner. The friend's partner accused the author of being an asshole and speculated the friend is pretending to be trans. The author now feels hostile towards the group and is being mocked as an anti-SJW. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author's actions were wrong. They mentioned they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except in discussions. The key incident was when they made a comment while stoned, which the friend's partner took offense to. The author apologized and affirmed respect, but the issue remains. \n\nThe question is about whether not believing in genderfluidity is wrong. However, what's more important here is the author's public expression of that belief, especially under the influence and then causing harm. The friend's partner felt attacked, and the author's comment was made in a group setting, leading to the friend's partner feeling the need to defend them. The author then avoided the group due to hostility, and the group is making jokes about them.\n\nThe main points to consider: 1) The author expressed their disbelief publicly, which could be seen as invalidating someone's identity. 2) The comment was made under the influence, which might affect judgment but doesn't excuse the harm caused. 3) The author did apologize, which is a positive step. 4) The group's reaction might be over the top, but the author's initial comment likely started the conflict.\n\nEven if the author personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity, expressing that in a way that harms others is problematic. Respecting others' identities is important, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's actions led to hurt feelings and group dynamics issues. While they apologized, the fact that they made the comment in the first place, especially under the influence, might be seen as careless. However, the group's response could be overly sensitive. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was hurtful and contributed to the conflict. So, likely the answer is A, they are in the wrong because their actions caused harm and were disrespectful to someone else's identity.\n"
