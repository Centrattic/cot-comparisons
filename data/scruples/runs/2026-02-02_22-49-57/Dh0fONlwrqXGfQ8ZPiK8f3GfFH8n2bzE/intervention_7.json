Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is posted on Reddit as an \"Am I the Asshole?\" question.\n\nFirst, the author is described as left-leaning, atheist, and supportive of equal rights. They don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. The key issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. The friend in question has changed names multiple times, slips up on their identity, and hasn't changed appearance or habits. The author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief, apologized, and affirmed respect despite differing beliefs.\n\nThe friend's partner called out the author and speculated that the friend is \"trying out being trans.\" The author avoids the group due to perceived hostility and coddling from the group. The author didn't just reject the friend but is critical of the group's sensitivity, comparing them to the \"SJW\" stereotype.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's stance is that genderfluidity isn't real, which is a controversial position. Even if they respect the person, their disbelief could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. The fact that they were stoned when they made the comment might reduce intent, but the impact is still there. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's response are reactions to being invalidated, which can be hurtful. The author's choice to avoid the group suggests they feel uncomfortable with the perceived hypersensitivity, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility if their words caused harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they only expressed their disbelief once, apologized, and respect their friends. They're not refusing to acknowledge the person's identity, just their belief in it. However, the ongoing name changes and identity confusion might indicate the friend is still figuring things out, not necessarily insincere. The author's criticism of \"over-sensitivity\" and comparison to \"anti SJW types\" could contribute to a toxic environment, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's disbelief itself isn't illegal or a violation of rights, but in interpersonal relationships, respecting others' identities is key. Even if someone doesn't believe, they should avoid causing harm. The author's actions (apologizing, respecting the person) show they're trying, but the initial statement about not believing in genderfluidity, especially when it's part of someone's identity, can be hurtful. The friend's partner felt the need to call out the author, which suggests that the comment was impactful and hurtful.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in a legal or moral sense (as everyone is entitled to their beliefs), but in terms of social responsibility and empathy, they are in the wrong for causing distress and not fully supporting a friend's self-identified identity. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
