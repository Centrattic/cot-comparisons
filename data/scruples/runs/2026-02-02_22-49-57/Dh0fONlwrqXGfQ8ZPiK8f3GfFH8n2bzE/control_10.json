Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The friend is in a relationship with someone who is MTF (male-to-female), and the friend recently identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThe key points: The author mentioned not believing in genderfluidity once, which was under the influence of being stoned. They got called out by the friend's girlfriend in a group message, and there's been some tension since. The author has changed their name multiple times and seems unsure about their identity. The author avoids the group because of the hostility from them, and they feel targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Gender identity is a sensitive topic, especially in modern discussions. The author is an atheist and left-leaning, so they might support equal rights but have personal beliefs they don't share. The main issue is the author's public statement (even if under the influence) of not believing in genderfluidity, which upset their friend's partner. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's identity, respecting others' self-identification is crucial. The author did express their disbelief, which could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if it was under the influence and apologized, the act of stating disbelief can be hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friends regardless. They also clarified that they only made the comment once in context. The friend's behavior (changing names, identity slip-ups) might contribute to the author's skepticism. But the author's avoidance and the group's reaction might be part of the issue. \n\nThe line between holding personal beliefs and respecting others' identities is thin. The author isn't attacking the friend's identity per se but expressing disbelief in the concept. However, in many communities, such statements are seen as transphobic or invalidating. Even if the author isn't hostile, the mere expression of disbelief can be harmful. \n\nThe friend's partner's reaction and the group's over-sensitivity, as the author describes, might be part of a toxic dynamic. But the author's stance could still be problematic. The key here is whether the author's statement crossed into being disrespectful or hurtful. Since they apologized and stated respect, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But the fact that the friend's identity is fluid and the author's skepticism could be seen as not respecting that fluidity. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong here because even if they have personal beliefs, not respecting someone's self-identified gender can be considered harmful, regardless of intent. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
