Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, and doesn't oppose equal rights. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The friend's partner is MTF, and the friend is now genderfluid. The author was stoned when they expressed doubt, and the friend's partner called them out in a group message. The friend changed names four times, uses different names, and the author feels the friend is histrionic. The author apologized and respects their friends despite the belief.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, legal or ethical wrong? In many places, gender identity is protected, so dismissing someone's identity could be harmful. The author's friend is genderfluid, which is a valid identity. The author's public doubt, even if under the influence, might be hurtful. The friend's partner's reaction suggests it's a sensitive topic. The author did apologize, but the friend's partner still took it personally. \n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is important for their mental health and well-being. Even if the author doesn't believe in the concept, not respecting someone's self-identified gender can be seen as invalidating. The author's avoidance of the group might be a result of discomfort, but that's not the friend's fault. The friend changing names and using different pronouns might be part of their self-expression. The author's public doubt contributed to the tension. \n\nSo, even though the author apologized, their initial statement likely hurt their friend. The friend's partner's message about being supportive versus being an asshole suggests that the community expects support. The author's belief isn't the issue, but their public expression of it in a sensitive context is. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity publicly, despite personal beliefs.\n"
