Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some conflict with friends over it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and doesn't oppose equal rights, even if they disagree. They mention a friend who is genderfluid and someone else who's MTF. The author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned, and the friend's partner accused them of being an asshole. The author apologized and affirmed their respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs. Now, they're being mocked for not being an anti-SJW, and they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in genderfluidity but not acting disrespectfully. The author says they keep it to themselves unless discussing, and when they did, they were under the influence and later apologized. The friend's partner seems to have taken it personally, and the group is being hostile. The author is avoiding the group now because of the hostility. Are they wrong for their beliefs, even if they're respectful?\n\nI need to consider the context. The author states they don't oppose equal rights and respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. The disagreement is about a personal belief in a social concept, not about denying rights or being openly disrespectful. The problem arises from the friend's reaction and the group dynamics, possibly involving oversensitivity or misunderstanding. The author's stance isn't about discrimination but personal belief, and they've made efforts to apologize and respect their friends. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is important, but personal beliefs (as long as they don't harm others) are a matter of individual thought. The author's wrongness would depend on their actions. If they're not actively harming or discriminating, just disagreeing, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they were disrespectful or dismissive, that's different. The post says they kept it to themselves unless discussing, and when they did, they were stoned and later apologized. The friend's partner's reaction might be hypersensitive. The author isn't being mean-spirited, just expressing a belief. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for holding a personal belief, even if it's unpopular, as long as they're respectful. The answer would be B (No).\n"
