Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights, even if they disagree with certain views. They were in a group where a friend transitioned to genderfluid. The author doesn't really believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps that to themselves unless discussing. The situation came up when the author was stoned and expressed their disbelief. The friend's girlfriend then called out the author in a group message, and there were some private speculations that the author was trying to push the friend as trans. The friend has changed their name multiple times and sometimes slips up on their identity. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility. The author apologized for hurting feelings and respects their friends, but they're now being compared to anti-SJW types. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves, except when discussing. They made a comment while stoned, which led to conflict. The friend's GF is upset, and the author apologized. The author avoids the group because of the hostility they feel. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying into the friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting people's identities is a big deal, especially in progressive circles. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a certain identity, expressing doubt can be hurtful. The author admitted they made a comment while under the influence and later apologized, but the friend's GF was directly called out, which might have caused embarrassment or hurt feelings. The author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a form of punishment or withdrawal of support, which might be seen as adding to the problem.\n\nHowever, the author does mention they support equal rights and respect their friends regardless. They only expressed their disbelief once in a specific context. The friend's behavior, like changing names and slipping up on identity, might be seen as inconsistent, which could lead the author to question the authenticity. But that's a different issue. The author's right to hold their belief isn't necessarily the problem, but how they expressed it and the consequences.\n\nIn terms of the question of being an asshole, it's about whether the author's actions were inconsiderate or harmful. The main action was expressing their disbelief, which led to the friend's GF being upset. The author did apologize, but the aftermath led to the author avoiding the group and being mocked for being like anti-SJW types. The question is whether the author's initial statement was wrong, even if they apologized.\n\nIn many social contexts, even if you don't believe in someone's identity, you're expected to respect it to avoid causing harm. The author's comment, even if made in a discussion, could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. The fact that the friend changed names and has inconsistencies might not justify the author's doubt, because people's identities can be complex and evolving. The author's judgment could be seen as dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowed to have their own beliefs and might not be in the wrong for expressing them in a context where it was appropriate. The problem might be more about the friend's reaction and the group's hostility, rather than the author's initial statement. But the author's apology and respect for the friend's rights might mitigate some of that.\n\nSo weighing it, the author might not be in the wrong for having their belief and expressing it once, but the way it was handled and the subsequent avoidance could be seen as contributing to the problem. However, the main issue is whether the initial statement was wrong. Since the author apologized and respects the friend, maybe they're not the asshole. But the fact that they don't believe in the identity and made it known, leading to conflict, might make them the asshole in the eyes of the friend and the group. The answer could be A or B depending on the perspective. If the focus is on respecting others regardless of personal belief, then A. If it's about the author's right to their belief and the apology, then B.\n"
