Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights. They don't oppose equal rights even when they disagree. So their stance isn't about discrimination but disagreement with the concept itself. \n\nThe key points here: The author has a friend who identifies as genderfluid. The friend's partner is MTF (male-to-female). The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. The story mentions a situation where the author was stoned and expressed his disbelief in a group chat, leading to the friend's partner feeling upset and others accusing him of being anti-SJW. The author apologizes and states he respects them regardless. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the nuances. The author's belief is personal, and they didn't act on it in a harmful way beyond expressing it once under the influence. However, even if the author's intention was to not judge, the act of expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be hurtful. Gender identity is deeply personal, and dismissing it can be seen as invalidating. \n\nThe author says he doesn't believe in the concept but respects their rights. However, respecting someone's rights and respecting their identity are different. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity, even if they don't agree with it. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's hostility suggest that the author's words were hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions avoiding the group because of the hostility, which might indicate that their actions contributed to the tension. The fact that he was stoned and made a comment that was taken poorly adds context but doesn't necessarily absolve him. Apologizing is good, but if the harm was done, maybe there's more to address.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't force his beliefs, only expressed them in a private context under the influence. The friend's partner might have taken offense, but does that make the author wrong? The line between personal belief and respecting others' identities can be blurry. If the author's words caused harm, even unintentionally, he might be in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, the key is respecting someone's identity regardless of personal belief. So even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, he should respect the friend's self-identification. The act of not buying into it but not acting against it might be seen as not the author's fault, but the expression of disapproval could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting someone's identity is separate from personal beliefs. Expressing disbelief, even once, can be hurtful and contribute to a hostile environment. The author's main issue is not in believing but in expressing that belief in a way that affects others negatively.\n"
