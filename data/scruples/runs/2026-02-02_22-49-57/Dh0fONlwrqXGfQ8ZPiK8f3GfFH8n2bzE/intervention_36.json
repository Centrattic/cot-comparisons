Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they are the asshole (AITA) for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author is left-leaning, atheist, supports equal rights, but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They mention they keep their views to themselves unless discussing. In this case, they expressed their disbelief while stoned, and later apologized. The friend's GF was upset, leading to the group being told not to be \"assholes,\" specifically calling out the author. The friend is described as changing names multiple times, slipping on identity, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic. The author avoids the group due to hostility and the group mocks them as anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author expressed their personal belief, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. However, the friend's identity is a personal matter. The problem arises from the author's public statement (even if under the influence) and the subsequent consequences. But is it wrong to hold that belief if they're respectful and don't impose it?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, respecting someone's identity is typically expected, even if you don't personally agree. The author's statement that they don't believe in genderfluidity, even if made in context and under the influence, could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. Even if they apologized, the act of expressing disbelief in a situation where the friend is disclosing their identity might be hurtful. The author is avoiding the group because of the perceived hostility, but maybe the group's reaction is part of the larger issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly attacking the friend; they're just sharing their own perspective. They do apologize and affirm respect. However, the friend's identity is central to them, so the author's disbelief might be seen as not respecting that. The author's personal belief isn't the issue per se, but expressing it in a way that's hurtful could be problematic. The friend changing names and identities might be part of their journey, but the author's judgment of it as \"histrionic\" adds a negative connotation.\n\nAlso, the group's reaction of mocking the author for being anti-SJW suggests that there's a larger conflict here. The author is trying to balance their personal views with the group's expectations of political correctness. The question is whether it's wrong to hold a personal belief and express it, even if it's not in line with the dominant view.\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to respect others' identities regardless of their personal beliefs. So, while the author isn't forcing their views, stating disbelief in a context where the friend is asserting their identity could be seen as invalidating. Even if done in a discussion and under the influence, the outcome is that the friend and their partner feel upset. The author's apology might mitigate some of the blame, but the initial statement could still be seen as harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance might be in the wrong because respecting another's identity is a social expectation, even if they personally disagree. The author's belief doesn't negate the friend's right to their identity. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their disbelief was expressed in a way that hurt a friend's identity and caused group tension, despite subsequent apologies.\n"
