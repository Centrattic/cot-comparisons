Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The original post is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so the question is about whether the author's actions and beliefs make them the asshole in this situation.\n\nFirst, the author states they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed this disbelief, and their friend's GF called them out in a group message. The friend changed their name four times and sometimes uses their birth name or identifies as male. The author thinks their friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility from the others who are described as following Tumblr's oversensitivity and coddling ethos. The author apologized for hurting feelings and respects their friends despite their personal belief.\n\nNow, considering the context, the main issue is the author's disbelief in their friend's gender identity and the resulting behavior. The key points here are the author's public expression of disbelief (even if it was in a private setting under the influence), their judgment of their friend's actions as histrionic, and avoiding a group due to perceived hostility.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social responsibility, even if someone personally disagrees with a friend's gender identity, it's generally considered respectful to acknowledge the friend's self-identification. The friend has made changes (name changes, self-identification) that are significant, and the author's refusal to accept these could be seen as dismissive or invalidating. The fact that the author called out their friend in the group and made them feel targeted could be a breach of trust and respect, especially since the friend is part of a marginalized group. The author might be contributing to a hostile environment by not respecting their friend's identity, even if they don't want to be part of the \"SJW\" comparisons.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and says they respect their friend regardless of their belief. But personal belief versus respecting someone's identity are different. The author's actions (avoiding the group, expressing disbelief, not buying into the identity) might still be harmful even if they don't hold a grudge. The fact that the friend's partner is upset and the group is hostile towards the author's views suggests that the author's stance is causing issues in their social relationships.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting their friend's self-identified gender, which can be hurtful and invalidating, even if they claim to support equal rights otherwise. The personal belief doesn't excuse the impact on the friend's well-being and the social dynamics.\n"
