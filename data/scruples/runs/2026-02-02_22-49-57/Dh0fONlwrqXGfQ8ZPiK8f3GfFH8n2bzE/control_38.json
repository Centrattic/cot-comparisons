Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as very left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to friends, one of whom is MTF (male-to-female) and another who is now genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nA discussion happened when the author was stoned. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) sent a message asking everyone to be supportive, mentioning the author. The GF thought the friend might be trying out being trans. The friend changes names a lot, uses different pronouns, and the author thinks they're being histrionic. The author has avoided the group because of the hostility from the friends who are overly sensitive, like Tumblr. The author only once said they don't believe in genderfluidity, was under influence, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. Now they're getting mocked for being an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? \n\nThe main issue here is the author's disbelief in their friend's gender identity. In the US, respecting someone's identity, even if you disagree, is generally expected. The author claims they don't oppose equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. However, even if you don't believe in it, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered important. \n\nThe author made a statement (under the influence) and was called out, which led to tension. They apologized and said they respect their friends regardless. But the friend's partner is upset, and the group seems to be taking it seriously. \n\nThe author is avoiding the group because of the \"hostility\" from the friends who are \"overly sensitive.\" The author is being mocked for not being a SJW, which suggests that others see them as intolerant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing a personal belief but not respecting the friend's self-identified gender. Even if they don't believe in it, using the friend's chosen name and pronouns is a standard expectation. The author's actions (not buying it) might not be illegal, but socially, it's considered disrespectful and harmful. \n\nThe key here is the impact on the friend. The author's disbelief could be invalidating and hurtful. While everyone has the right to their beliefs, the way those beliefs are expressed and the effect on others matters. The author did apologize, which shows they recognized the hurt, but the fact that they still don't buy into the genderfluidity might mean they don't fully respect the friend's identity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because respecting someone's self-identified gender is a common social expectation now, and the author's disbelief leads to them not supporting their friend, which is hurtful. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
