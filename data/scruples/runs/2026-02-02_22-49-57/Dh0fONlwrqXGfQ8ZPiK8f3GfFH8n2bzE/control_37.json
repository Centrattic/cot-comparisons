Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone not believing in genderfluidity and having some issues with their friend who identifies as genderfluid. The author says they're left-leaning, atheist, and don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They had a discussion while stoned where they expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, and the friend's GF accused them of being an asshole. The friend has been changing names and identities, and the author feels the friend is histrionic and avoids the group because of the hostility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't force their views, only mentioned their disbelief once while under the influence and then apologized. They respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. However, the friend's partner felt attacked, and the group seems to be very sensitive. The author is being accused of being an antagonist because they don't buy into the genderfluid concept, even though they're not opposing the person's rights or identity.\n\nBut wait, the author's problem isn't with the person's identity per se but the concept of genderfluidity. They think the friend is histrionic and not changing appearance or habits. That could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. Even if the author says they respect them, their beliefs might come off as dismissive. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the comment hurt, which the author did apologize for. \n\nThe question is whether expressing disbelief in a concept, even if done once and in context, is wrong. Since the author is part of a group that values social justice, their stance might conflict with the group's values. The friend's behavior (changing names, identity) could be genuine for some people, so dismissing it as histrionic might be insensitive. \n\nThe author tried to be respectful but their underlying disbelief could be harmful. The main issue might be not respecting the friend's self-identified identity, even if they don't personally believe in the concept. Even if the author doesn't act on it, holding that belief might contribute to a hostile environment. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's sensitivity indicate that the author's stance is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if not directly attacking the person, invalidates the friend's identity and creates tension. However, if they're not actively opposing the person's rights or treating them poorly beyond their personal belief, maybe not. But considering the impact on the friend and the group's dynamics, the author's stance is harmful, so they're in the wrong.\n"
