Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions. They had a discussion while stoned and the friend's GF accused them of being an asshole. The author now feels hostile towards the group because they follow what they see as over-sensitive Tumblr politics.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is an atheist and left-leaning, so they probably consider themselves open-minded. They mention not opposing equal rights even if they disagree with certain concepts. The issue here is about genderfluidity, which they don't believe in, but they only expressed this once while stoned. They apologized and affirmed respect for their friends.\n\nThe GF's friend is genderfluid, changing names and having identity issues. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic. The key question is whether the author is wrong for not accepting the friend's gender identity.\n\nIn many places, respecting someone's gender identity is seen as a basic courtesy, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if the author doesn't agree with genderfluidity, treating the friend with respect is expected. The author's statement that they don't believe in the concept could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which can be hurtful. The fact that the author mentioned this in a group chat, leading to being called an asshole, suggests that the friends felt disrespected. The author then avoided the group, possibly due to not wanting to engage with their views, which might come off as judgmental or unsupportive.\n\nThe author apologized, but the main issue is whether not believing in a gender identity is a valid reason for being called an asshole. Societally, respecting others' identities is important, even if one doesn't agree. So, even though the author apologized, the initial statement might have been a breach of social norms. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the author's disbelief in the friend's identity, even if not expressed often, led to conflict and disrespect, which is considered wrong in this context.\n"
