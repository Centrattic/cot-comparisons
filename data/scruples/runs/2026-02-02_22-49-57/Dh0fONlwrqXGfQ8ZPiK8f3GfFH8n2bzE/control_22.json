Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nThe author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The key points here are their stance on gender identity, the context of the discussion (they were stoned), and the friend's reaction. The author mentions they said they don't believe in genderfluidity once, which the friend took offense to. The friend's significant other called out the author specifically, implying they might be trying to transition. The author then distanced themselves from the group because they felt hostile, citing the group's sensitivity and association with Tumblr culture. They apologize for any hurt and state they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The main issue here is whether expressing disbelief in a friend's gender identity, even if done once and under the influence, is wrong. The author acknowledges their stance but also shows respect for their friend's identity despite their beliefs. However, the act of publicly expressing disbelief, even if in a private group, could be hurtful. The friend's reaction suggests that the comment was taken personally and possibly invalidated their identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms and respect, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating, especially when the person is part of a marginalized group. The author claims they respect their friends regardless, but the initial statement might have caused harm regardless of intent. The context of being stoned might mitigate the intent, but the impact still matters. The author's avoidance of the group afterward might be a natural response to the tension, but it's unclear if that's their fault or the friends' overreaction. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement was a personal belief expressed privately and whether the friend's reaction was proportionate. However, given that the author was called out by the friend's partner and the resulting tension led to avoidance, it's possible the author's statement was the catalyst. Even if the author believed they were being respectful, the statement could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Considering the harm caused by the statement and the social context, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that hurt their friend, even if it was under the influence. However, the author did apologize and respect their friend's identity otherwise. But the initial act of disbelief, even if not aggressive, might still be considered wrong in this context. So leaning towards A.\n"
