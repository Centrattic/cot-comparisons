Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post. The situation is about the author not buying into a friend's genderfluidity and whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They mentioned their disbelief once, while stoned, and apologized later. The friend's partner called them out, and the author now feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people. The author has been avoiding the group because of the hostility they feel from the friends who are part of a more sensitive, Tumblr-like group.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's disbelief in their friend's gender identity. The question is whether that disbelief, even if kept private and with an apology, is wrong. \n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, respecting someone's gender identity is generally considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if the author says they support equal rights, not accepting a friend's identity could be seen as harmful. The fact that the author made their disbelief known, even once, might have caused hurt feelings, which they did apologize for. However, continuing to distance themselves from the group because of the resulting hostility could be seen as a valid reaction, but the initial statement might still be problematic.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014avoiding the group due to the hostility\u2014are their own choice, but the initial expression of disbelief, even under influence, could be seen as transgressing social boundaries, especially in a group that values sensitivity. The key here is whether not believing in someone's gender identity is inherently wrong. In most modern perspectives, it's considered respectful to acknowledge someone's identity regardless of personal beliefs. So, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they later apologized. But there's also the context of the friend changing names and identities frequently, which might make the author question the sincerity. However, that's not the author's place to judge. The author's responsibility is to respect the friend's self-identified gender, regardless of their personal beliefs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, leading to the conclusion A.\n"
