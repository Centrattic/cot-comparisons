Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong according to the situation described. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their opinions to themselves except during discussions. However, when they did express their views while under the influence, it led to some conflict with their friend who is genderfluid. The friend's partner called out the author in a group message, and there's been tension since. The author is questioning if they're the asshole (AITA) for not buying into their friend's gender identity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and supports equal rights despite personal disagreements. They mention that they don't believe in genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves. The problem arose when they expressed this under the influence and didn't apologize enough, according to the friend's partner. The author did apologize and affirmed respect, but there's ongoing hostility from the group, comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations here are about personal beliefs versus respecting others' identities. In many modern contexts, especially in Western societies, there's a strong emphasis on respecting individuals' gender identities regardless of personal beliefs. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity, but they're not opposing their friend's rights. However, the way they expressed their disbelief\u2014especially under the influence and in a stoned state\u2014might have been inappropriate or hurtful.\n\nThe friend's partner's reaction might be based on the hurt caused by the author's statement, even if the author later apologized. The partner might feel that the author's disbelief undermines their friend's identity. Even if the author respects the friend generally, the act of expressing disbelief in the context of a group where others are more supportive could be seen as invalidating. The author's choice to avoid the group due to their own discomfort might also contribute to the perceived hostility.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"performative allyship\" or \"cultural sensitivity.\" The author's stance that they don't believe in genderfluidity might be seen as a personal opinion, but in a social context where the group is more progressive, such opinions can be seen as problematic even if the author isn't directly attacking the friend. The key here is whether the author's words or actions crossed the line into being disrespectful or harmful, despite their intentions.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is avoiding the group because of the \"hostility\" they feel might be a red flag. If the group is being overly sensitive (as per the author's description), but the author's initial comment could have contributed to the tension. The author might be justified in their personal beliefs but is it inconsiderate to express them in a way that causes distress?\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone's personal beliefs differ, publicly expressing disbelief in a friend's identity can be harmful. The author's apology and respect for the friend's rights might mitigate some blame, but the act of expressing disbelief in a context where it's likely to cause hurt is problematic. The partner's reaction in the group message suggests that the author's words were indeed hurtful and not just a private opinion.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions led to conflict and hurt feelings. While they claim to respect the friend's identity, the way they expressed their disbelief (under the influence, in a group setting) was likely inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, even if rooted in personal belief, caused harm and were disrespectful to their friend's identity.\n"
