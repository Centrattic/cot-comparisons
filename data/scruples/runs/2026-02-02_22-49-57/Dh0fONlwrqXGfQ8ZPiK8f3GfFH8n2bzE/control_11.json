Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The scenario involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing backlash from their friend's partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even when they disagree. They mention they usually keep their views private unless discussing. The issue arises when the author, under the influence, expressed skepticism about genderfluidity, leading to being called out by the friend's GF. The friend in question is genderfluid, changes names frequently, and the author feels hostility from the group, who they think are too sensitive, referencing Tumblr's ethos.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the elements. \n\nThe author's main argument is that they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep their thoughts to themselves unless discussing. They had a single instance where they expressed this under the influence, apologized, and affirmed respect for their friends. However, the friend's GF took offense, and the group seems to have turned against the author, even comparing them to anti-SJW trolls. The author also mentions avoiding the group due to feeling hostile.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the key points are: the author's expression of personal belief (even if disagreeable) vs. the friend's need for support. The author did apologize and showed respect despite their beliefs. However, public expression (even if in a private group) of disbelief in someone's identity can be hurtful. The line between holding personal beliefs and respecting someone's identity is crucial here.\n\nIn many societies, especially in progressive circles, respecting someone's stated identity is considered a baseline, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's public statement, even if made under influence, could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. While the author claims to respect their friend regardless, the act of publicly expressing disbelief might have caused harm, which is why the friend's partner reacted. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might also contribute to the situation, but the initial statement was the catalyst.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize, which shows some accountability. The question is whether expressing a personal belief (even one that others may find harmful) in a private context is wrong. It's a nuanced issue. On one hand, freedom of speech includes expressing such views. On the other hand, it's about respecting others' identities and not causing harm.\n\nIn this context, the author might be seen as wrong because they made a public statement that could invalidate their friend's identity, even if they later apologized. The friend's partner's reaction is understandable if they felt the author was undermining their partner's identity. While the author believes they are respecting the friend, the action of not buying into the genderfluidity aspect could be harmful, especially in a close group where support is expected.\n\nBut then again, the author is in a private group with friends and is allowed to have their own views, as long as they don't attack the person. However, the act of not believing in someone's gender identity can be seen as transphobic, even if the author doesn't intend it. The key is that the friend's identity is self-determined, and the author's disbelief doesn't negate that. So, the author's statement might be considered wrong in this context because it's a form of invalidation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in someone's identity in a way that caused harm, even if they later apologized. Their personal beliefs don't justify invalidating another person's self-identified gender, especially in a social setting where respect is expected.\n"
