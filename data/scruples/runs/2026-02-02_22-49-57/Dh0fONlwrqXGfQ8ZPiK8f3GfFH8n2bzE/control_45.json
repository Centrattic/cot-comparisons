Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but trying to respect their friend's identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, supports equal rights. They don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep their opinion to themselves unless discussing it. The friend is genderfluid, and the author had a discussion while stoned, leading to some conflict. The friend's partner accused the author of not being supportive, and the group labeled the author as an anti-SJW. The author apologized and respects their friends regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social aspects. The author is expressing a personal disbelief in a gender identity, but in a respectful manner, not opposing their rights. The issue here is whether just holding a personal belief, even if it's considered incorrect by others, makes someone an asshole. \n\nIn many contexts, especially in modern discussions, it's considered respectful to acknowledge someone's identity even if you don't personally agree with the concept. However, the author is not denying the friend's rights or treating them poorly beyond their personal belief. They apologized and affirmed respect. The conflict arises from the friend's and the group's sensitivity and the comparison to anti-SJWs.\n\nThe key is whether the author's belief itself is wrong. If the author is not being discriminatory or harmful, just holding a different belief, they might not be in the wrong. But if their belief leads to disrespect or invalidation, then they could be. The author says they avoid the group due to hostility, which suggests the group's reaction is part of the problem.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on personal belief versus respect for identity. Since the author is not acting on their belief in a harmful way but is facing social backlash, the question is whether the author is wrong for having that belief. Legally and ethically, respecting identities is important, but personal beliefs aren't always punishable unless they cause harm. The author's actions don't seem harmful, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
