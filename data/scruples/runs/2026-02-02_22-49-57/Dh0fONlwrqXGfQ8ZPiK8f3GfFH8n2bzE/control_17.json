Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The scenario involves the author being labeled as an asshole for not accepting this aspect of their friend's identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author states they are left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights despite personal disagreements. They mention that a friend's partner is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps their thoughts to themselves unless in a discussion. \n\nAn incident occurred where the author was stoned and expressed doubt about genderfluidity, which led to the friend's partner feeling hurt and the author being called out. The author apologized and affirmed respect. However, they now feel targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW individuals. \n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nNow, from a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, even if you don't personally agree with it. The author's statement of not believing in genderfluidity, even if made in a private discussion, can be seen as invalidating their friend's identity. The fact that the friend's partner felt it necessary to call out the author in a group message suggests that the comment was hurtful. \n\nThe author did apologize and clarify their respect, but the act of expressing disbelief can still be harmful. The friend's partner changing names frequently and the author labeling their behavior as \"histrionic\" might also contribute to the tension. \n\nIn many communities, especially those that value social justice, expressing skepticism about gender identity can be viewed as discriminatory, regardless of the individual's intent. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility could be a result of their own comments. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions\u2014expressing disbelief and contributing to the friend's discomfort\u2014likely place them in the wrong, even if they later apologized. The question is about whether they are in the wrong, not just the immediate consequence. So the answer would be A.\n"
