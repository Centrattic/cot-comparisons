Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, during a stoned conversation, they expressed this disbelief, leading to tension with the friend's GF who accused the author of being an asshole. The friend in question has been changing names and identities, which the author thinks is histrionic. The author avoids the group now because of the hostility and is being mocked for not being as supportive as \"SJWs.\"\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about respecting someone's identity versus personal beliefs. Even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, the key issue is whether they are respecting their friend's self-identification. The author apologized and affirmed respect, but their public disbelief might have caused hurt feelings. However, they did apologize. \n\nBut, in many communities, especially those that prioritize social justice, respecting someone's identity is crucial regardless of personal beliefs. The author's actions might be seen as invalidating their friend's experience. The friend changing names and identities is part of their personal journey, and the author's public skepticism could be hurtful, even if they apologize later. The mention of being mocked for not being an SJW suggests there's a judgmental environment, which complicates things. But the author's stance is about not believing in the concept, which could be seen as transphobic, regardless of their other progressive views. \n\nSo the answer might hinge on the idea that respecting someone's identity is separate from personal belief. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they publicly expressed disbelief, leading to hurt feelings and conflict, despite their apology. Their actions don't support their friend's identity, which is considered disrespectful regardless of their other beliefs. Hence, Answer A.\n"
