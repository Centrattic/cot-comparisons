Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some conflict with a friend who is genderfluid.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are left-leaning and support equal rights, even if they disagree with certain concepts. They don't oppose people's rights, which is a good point. However, they express disbelief in genderfluidity. The key issue here is whether this disbelief makes them wrong, especially in the context of their friend's identity.\n\nThe friend in question has changed their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or identifies as male. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic. The friend's partner also expressed concern that the author might be trying to undermine their relationship. The author, under the influence of being stoned, made a comment about not believing in genderfluidity, which caused some tension. They apologized later but still faced jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering social norms and current societal values, people are generally expected to respect others' identities even if they don't personally agree with the concept. The author is respecting the friend's rights but holds a different belief. However, the problem arises when their disbelief is vocalized, even if it's in a private context. The fact that the author's comment was made in a group chat where the friend's partner felt targeted might contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe author claims they avoid the group because of the hostility, but the group's reaction might be due to feeling disrespected or invalidated. The author's stance isn't about opposing rights but disagreeing with the concept itself. However, in modern discourse, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be seen as harmful, even if done privately. The line between personal belief and public respect is thin here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their disbelief. While they are not hostile towards the person's rights, their personal beliefs being shared in a context that caused hurt might place some responsibility on them. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting a person's identity, regardless of personal belief, is a social expectation, and the author's actions contributed to the conflict despite their intentions.\n"
