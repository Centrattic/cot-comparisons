Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some conflict with their friend's gender identity.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't buy into the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They did mention it once while stoned and later apologized. The friend's partner accused them of being an \"asshole\" and there's some tension because the friend is changing names and identities frequently. The author feels their friend is histrionic and avoids the group due to their \"hostility\" towards the over-sensitivity they perceive in the group.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a gender identity, respecting others' identities is generally expected. The author did express their disbelief, which might have hurt feelings, even with an apology. However, they claim they respect their friends regardless. The key points are: the author's statement might have been hurtful, but they apologized. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's subsequent behavior (hostility, jokes) are also factors.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The post is about the author's beliefs conflicting with their friend's identity. In terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is a common standard, even if one doesn't agree. The author's refusal to accept their friend's identity, even if they apologize, could still be seen as harmful. However, the author isn't forcing their views, just not buying into it. The line between personal belief and respecting others is tricky here. The answer depends on societal norms around gender identity and personal responsibility in relationships. Given that the author is causing distress and the situation is affecting group dynamics, it's possible the author is in the wrong. But if the author is not actively harming beyond expressing personal beliefs, maybe not. However, in modern contexts, respecting someone's identity is often considered a basic courtesy, so the author's stance might be seen as wrong.\n"
