Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author admits to not believing in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. The situation involves a friend who is genderfluid, and the author had a discussion while stoned, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in the concept but don't usually voice their opinion. However, they did mention it once when stoned and then apologized. The friend's girlfriend called them out, leading to tension. The group seems to be more sensitive around these issues, and the author feels hostility. They also mention being mocked by others for not being a \"SJW.\"\n\nNow, the key points: The author respects their friends but doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a one-time comment under the influence, apologized, and are trying to avoid conflict. However, they're facing social backlash for their views.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. From a social perspective, even if someone doesn't personally agree with someone's identity, respecting their identity is important. The author's issue is not with the friend's identity per se but with the concept. However, the problem arises when their disbelief leads to public statements or actions that could undermine the friend's identity, even if it's a private belief.\n\nThe author did make a comment, even if under the influence, which caused offense. The friend's partner felt the need to call them out, indicating that the comment was hurtful. The author's main action is holding a personal belief, which isn't illegal, but in social contexts, respecting others' identities is expected. Avoiding the group might be a reaction to feeling hostility, but the initial comment was problematic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. The answer hinges on whether personal beliefs conflict with social expectations. Since the author didn't act on their beliefs in a harmful way beyond the one comment (and did apologize), but the comment still caused harm, they might share some responsibility. However, the broader issue is the conflict between personal belief and social respect. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author's mistake was the comment they made, not their personal disbelief. The key is that the author's belief itself isn't wrong, but the way they expressed it (even once) and the subsequent avoidance of the group could be seen as disrespectful. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into the genderfluidity. If the author's disbelief leads to not respecting the friend's identity, then yes, they are in the wrong. If they respect the identity despite their disbelief, then no.\n\nIn the scenario, the author says they respect their friends regardless. But the friend's behavior (changing names, etc.) is a personal choice, not necessarily a reflection of the author's acceptance. The author's main issue is the one comment and the social fallout. So, is the author in the wrong? If the comment was hurtful and they didn't support the friend's identity in public, that's the issue. But the initial disbelief alone isn't wrong if it's kept private. However, in this case, the author did express it in a group context, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite their personal beliefs, expressing doubt about someone's identity in a group setting where others are sensitive to such issues caused harm, and the author's actions (the comment and subsequent avoidance) contributed to the conflict. Even if they apologized, the act itself was problematic.\n"
