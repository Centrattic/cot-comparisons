Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their thoughts to themselves unless discussing. The friend's partner called out the author for being an asshole in a group message. The friend in question is genderfluid, changes names often, and the author thinks they're being histrionic.\n\nFirst, the author states they don't believe in genderfluidity but don't publicly express this unless in a discussion. They mention saying it once while stoned, then apologized. The key points here are: the author's private disbelief vs. their actions. They didn't act on their beliefs, except once under influence. However, the friend's partner took offense and grouped them with anti-SJW types. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal perspective, respecting someone's identity is crucial. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, respecting others' identities is about validation and support. The author's private beliefs aren't the issue, but the fact that they made a statement under influence and caused friction. However, they apologized and affirmed respect. \n\nBut the main issue is the author avoiding the group due to their hostility towards the \"oversensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr.\" This suggests the author is distancing themselves because of differing social attitudes, not the friend's identity itself. The friend's partner's reaction might be the problem here. The author's stance is about personal belief but not acting on it except once. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author didn't act on their beliefs except for one offhand comment and then apologized, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of not supporting a friend's identity, even if it's a belief they don't share, could be seen as wrong. But the author says they respect their friends regardless. \n\nSo, considering societal norms and respect for identity, even if someone doesn't believe in it, respecting others' self-identification is key. The author's actions (avoiding the group due to perceived hostility) might be seen as the issue. However, the initial comment under influence and the subsequent apology might mitigate their wrongdoing. \n\nBut the partner's reaction of calling them an asshole in a group message might be the bigger issue. The author's private beliefs vs. the public shaming by the partner. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their beliefs or actions. Since the author didn't act maliciously, except once, and apologized, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, not supporting a friend's identity could be seen as wrong regardless of personal beliefs. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions (like the one comment) caused harm, and if avoiding the group is justified. But the partner's reaction is also part of the context. The author's main issue is not buying genderfluidity but not acting on it except once. The partner's group message might be the real problem, but the question is about the author. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's private belief isn't wrong, but the public comment might be. However, since they apologized and didn't act further, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer could be B (No).\n"
