Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. However, during a stoned conversation, they expressed their disbelief. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) then called out the author publicly in a group message, implying they were being an asshole. The author feels that the friend is being histrionic and has changed names and identities multiple times without changing appearance or habits. The author now feels hostile towards the group and is being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't support equal rights, but they say they don't oppose them. However, they do have personal disagreements with genderfluidity. They mentioned this once, stoned, and apologized. The main issue is whether the author was wrong for expressing that belief, even if they apologized, and whether their actions contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe friend's GF seems to have taken offense and escalated the situation by publicly mentioning the author. The author's friends are part of a group that's described as overly sensitive, which might contribute to the conflict. The author is now being compared to anti-SJW types, but they claim to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nSo, the author's actions: expressed a personal belief in a private discussion (though under the influence), apologized, and tried to avoid confrontation. The friends' reaction seems harsh, especially the public shaming. The author didn't force their opinion but had a disagreement. In terms of respect, the author says they respect their friend regardless. However, the problem is whether the author overstepped by expressing disbelief in someone's identity.\n\nIn many social contexts, especially with friends, it's expected to respect each other's identities even if you don't agree. The author's belief doesn't make them wrong if they express it respectfully, but the context here is that they were stoned and maybe not in the best state to have such a conversation. However, the friend's GF's reaction seems to be the main issue here\u2014publicly shaming the author for a private discussion. The author is being blamed for something they didn't do, perhaps, and the friends are overreacting.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The core issue is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but tried to keep it to themselves. However, when they did express it, even once, it led to conflict. The author's stance may be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which is a sensitive topic. Even if the author apologizes, the fact that they don't believe in the concept could be hurtful. But the friend changed names and identities multiple times, which the author finds histrionic. The author's opinion is that the friend is not being genuine, but that's the author's judgment.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, respecting others' self-identified gender is important. Even if someone doesn't believe in the concept, expressing that disbelief can be harmful. The author claims to respect friends regardless, but their disbelief might still be hurtful. The author's main mistake was expressing disbelief in a situation where it led to hurt feelings and conflict. Even though they apologized, the initial statement contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a private discussion that led to public shaming and ongoing conflict. Alternatively, the friends might be overreacting. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer could be A, meaning they are in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity. However, if the author is just expressing their personal belief without forcing it on others, maybe they are not in the wrong. It's tricky. The key is whether it's the author's fault for expressing a personal belief or the friends' for overreacting. Given that the author's belief is about someone's identity, which is a sensitive area, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting the friend's self-identification. So answer A.\n"
