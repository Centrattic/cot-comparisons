Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the Reddit-style scenario provided. \n\nFirst, the author is an atheist and self-described as very left-leaning, supporting equal rights. However, they don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep their views private unless discussing. The situation arises when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, which led to the friend's girlfriend (GF) calling them out in a group message. The GF suspects the friend is just \"trying out\" being trans. The author then avoids the group, feeling hostility because the group is \"over-sensitive\" and follows \"Tumblr\" ethics.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't force their opinion, but they did voice it once while under the influence. They apologized and stated they respect their friends regardless. However, the GF took offense and spread a message singling out the author. The author now feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nLegally and socially, expressing disbelief in a gender identity, even if considered incorrect, is a matter of opinion. However, in social contexts, especially with friends, how one expresses such views matters. The author did apologize and respects the friends' identities despite their disbelief. The GF's reaction might be seen as overstepping, but the author's initial comment could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe key here is that the author is not denying rights or being hostile beyond expressing their opinion. They are in a position where they respect others but have personal beliefs they don't fully endorse. The problem might be more about the friend group's reaction rather than the author's initial statement. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if we look at intent and actions: the author expressed a personal belief, apologized when it caused hurt, and continues to respect others. The wrong here might not be on the author's side, especially if they didn't intend harm and have accepted responsibility. The friend group's coddling and singling out the author could be the real issue. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author made a statement, took responsibility, and maintains respect for their friends. The friend's reaction and the group's response might be more problematic.\n"
