Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some conflicts with friends over it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights, but doesn't personally agree with the concept of genderfluidity. They mentioned this once when stoned, apologized, and avoid the group now because they feel hostile. The friend's partner accused them of being an asshole, and others are making jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author did express their disbelief but in a private setting, apologized, and clarified their respect. However, the friend's partner's reaction and the subsequent group dynamics suggest that the author's comment was hurtful. The author's avoidance might be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it's also possible they're not engaging because they feel unwelcome.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, respecting someone's identity is crucial. Even if the author disagrees, expressing disbelief can be hurtful. The fact that the friend changed names and identities multiple times might be confusing, but the author's public stance (even if private) could be seen as invalidating. The author did apologize, which shows some awareness, but the ongoing tension suggests the apology wasn't sufficient. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being respectful and not making someone feel invalidated is important. Even if the author's belief is their own, sharing it in a context where it causes harm might make them responsible. The friend's partner's message and the group's reaction indicate that the author's comment was not just a personal opinion but caused direct harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions led to hurt feelings and group hostility. Even though they apologized, the initial statement was disrespectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
