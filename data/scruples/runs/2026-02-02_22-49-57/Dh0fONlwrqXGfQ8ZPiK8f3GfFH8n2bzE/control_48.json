Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not believing in the concept of genderfluidity and how that affected their friendship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing it. However, when they did bring it up, it was while they were stoned, and they ended up causing some offense. Their friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message, and the author apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's personal belief conflicting with their friend's identity, the way they expressed their disbelief (under the influence, in a public message), and the resulting tension. The author also avoids the group due to feeling hostility and is being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend identifies as genderfluid, which is a valid identity for them. The author's issue is with the concept, not with the person. However, by expressing disbelief and causing offense, even if they apologized, they may have contributed to the conflict. The fact that they were under the influence might mitigate some responsibility, but not entirely.\n\nThe problem arises when personal beliefs lead to invalidating someone else's identity, even if done inadvertently. The author claims to respect their friends regardless of their beliefs, but the action of expressing disbelief in the context of a sensitive topic might have been hurtful. The friend's partner felt the need to call them out, indicating that the comment was perceived as harmful.\n\nSo, even though the author apologized, their initial statement might have been the catalyst for the group's reaction. They also mention avoiding the group, which could be seen as self-segregation due to their discomfort with the group's sensitivity. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their actions, despite being personal opinions, crossed into being disrespectful of their friend's identity. Since the friend's identity is a core part of their self-perception, not buying into the concept can be seen as dismissive, especially in a group setting where others are more sensitive.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their disbelief was expressed in a way that caused harm to the friendship and contributed to the group's hostility, even if they later apologized.\n"
