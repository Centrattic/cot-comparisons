Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain concepts. The main issue is their stance on genderfluidity.\n\nThe author was in a group where a friend came out as genderfluid. The friend's partner expressed concern that the author wasn't supportive. The author admitted to not believing in the concept of genderfluidity but kept their views private except during a discussion when they were stoned. The friend changed names multiple times and sometimes used their birth name or identified as male. The author felt uncomfortable, avoided the group, and faced jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's beliefs alone make them wrong. Beliefs about gender identity are part of personal opinion, but the key here is how they expressed those beliefs. The author apologized and affirmed respect for their friends. However, the context is important: even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, respecting someone's identity is different from agreeing with it. By not acknowledging their friend's identity and causing discomfort, the author might be failing in support despite their beliefs.\n\nThe fact that the friend changed names and had identity slips complicates things. The author's friend might be in a transition phase, but that doesn't negate their self-identified gender. The author's avoidance and the group's reaction suggest a conflict between personal beliefs and social support. Even if the author's stance is based on personal belief, the negative impact on their friend's social and emotional well-being is a factor.\n\nAlso, the author was under the influence when they made the comment, but they did apologize. However, the ongoing avoidance and the friend's partner's frustration indicate ongoing issues. The author's refusal to engage in the \"oversensitivity\" of the group might stem from their beliefs, but it's important to consider that supporting someone's identity isn't about agreement but about respect and validation.\n\nIn societal terms, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered a basic form of support, regardless of personal belief. The author's actions, though rooted in their own views, could be seen as dismissive. The question is whether holding a personal belief without acting on it is enough, or if the act of not supporting (by avoiding or expressing disbelief) is where the problem lies.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the friend and the group's reaction, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support, even if they don't personally believe in the concept. The wrong here isn't about the belief itself but the lack of respect for their friend's expressed identity. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
