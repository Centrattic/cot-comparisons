Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supportive of equal rights even when they disagree. They mention they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then there's a situation where they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend in question has been changing names and identities, and the author feels the friend is histrionic. They've avoided the group because of the hostility and the group's sensitivity, comparing them to Tumblr's over-sensitivity. The author apologized for hurting feelings but thinks they're not the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's belief (or lack thereof) in genderfluidity, their public expression of that belief under the influence, and the subsequent fallout. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, while people have the right to their beliefs, expressing disbelieve in someone's gender identity can be harmful. Even if the author claims to respect their friend regardless, the act of not acknowledging their identity can be invalidating. The fact that the friend has changed names and identities might indicate they're exploring their identity, and the author's public statement could be hurtful. The author apologized, but the impact of their words might still be significant. However, the author also mentions they avoid the group due to hostility, which complicates things.\n\nIn many modern contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered a basic courtesy, regardless of one's personal beliefs. The author's refusal to \"buy\" into the friend's identity could be seen as not respecting their autonomy. Even if the author is being genuine, the social expectation is often to support friends' identities, even if one disagrees internally. The friend's girlfriend's reaction and the group's sensitivity might stem from a desire to have their experiences validated.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because their disbelief, even if privately held, was expressed in a way that hurt their friend and caused tension. The apology is a step, but the initial act of not acknowledging the friend's identity could still be problematic. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because respecting personal identity is generally prioritized in such social dynamics.\n"
