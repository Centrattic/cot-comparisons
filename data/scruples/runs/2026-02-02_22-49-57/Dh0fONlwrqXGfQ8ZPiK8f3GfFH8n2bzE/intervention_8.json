Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong (AITA) for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights even if they disagree. They have a friend in a long-distance relationship who is transitioning (MTF) and another friend who is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThen, there's a situation where the friend's girlfriend (GF) messaged a group, including the author's name in parentheses, asking for support. The GF suspects the author is being an asshole and thinks the genderfluid friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The genderfluid friend has issues with their name and identity, changing names four times, and using male pronouns or their birth name. The author feels the friend is histrionic, avoids the group due to hostility, and the group is overly sensitive like Tumblr. The author admitted once that they don't believe in genderfluidity, was stoned, apologized, and respects their friends despite personal beliefs. They were mocked as anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author isn't. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author's stance: They don't believe in genderfluidity but don't oppose equal rights. They made a comment under the influence, apologized, and clarified respect. However, the friend's GF took offense, leading to the group messaging and the author feeling targeted. \n\nThe author avoids the group, which might contribute to tension. The friend's behavior (changing names, pronouns) could be confusing or inconsistent, which the author finds histrionic. The author is called out as an asshole by the group, and the author claims not to be an anti-SJW but is criticized for being mean.\n\nLegally and ethically, respecting someone's identity is important. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in it, they should respect the individual's self-identified gender. The author's comment about not believing in genderfluidity could be seen as dismissive, even if they apologized. However, the author claims they were stoned and that the comment was in context appropriate. They also said they respect their friends regardless.\n\nBut the problem is that the friend's GF took offense and the author's comment might have contributed to the tension. If the author is not respecting the friend's identity, even if they don't personally agree, that's a problem. The fact that the friend is changing names and pronouns might complicate things, but the author's stance on not believing in the concept could be harmful, even if they don't act on it.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the group might view the author as invalidating their friend's identity, which is a serious issue. Even if the author is not outwardly hostile, their disbelief could be seen as a form of microaggression. The author's avoidance of the group could also be seen as contributing to the problem by not engaging or trying to understand better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and tries to respect their friends. They might be struggling with their beliefs and trying to balance their personal views with respecting others. But the key here is that in modern social contexts, one's personal beliefs might not align with the accepted social norms, especially regarding gender identity. Dismissing someone's identity can be harmful, regardless of personal belief.\n\nSo, even if the author isn't acting in a malicious way, their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if kept private, might still be problematic. The act of stating that they don't believe in it, even once, under the influence, could have caused the friend and their partner to feel invalidated, leading to the group's reaction. The author's avoidance and the subsequent jokes about being anti-SJW might exacerbate the situation.\n\nTherefore, the author's stance of not believing in genderfluidity, even if they respect the person, could be considered as being in the wrong in this context because it contributes to the hurt feelings and conflict. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting someone's self-identified gender is a social expectation, and expressing disbelief can be harmful regardless of intent.\n"
