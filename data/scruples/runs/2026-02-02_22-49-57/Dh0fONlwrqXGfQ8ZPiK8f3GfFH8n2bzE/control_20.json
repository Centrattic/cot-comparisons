Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in the concept of genderfluidity but trying to keep it to themselves unless discussing it. The key points here are the author's personal beliefs versus their actions and interactions with friends.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are \"as left as they come\" and support equal rights even when they disagree. That suggests they're generally progressive. But they don't believe in genderfluidity. Now, the friend in question has transitioned names and is genderfluid. The author had a discussion about it while stoned, and the friend's GF accused them. The author apologized and said they respect the friend regardless of their beliefs.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. From a social perspective, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's identity, it's usually considered respectful to acknowledge and support that person's self-identification. The author is not out there publicly denouncing genderfluidity, but their private beliefs and the way they expressed them (even under influence) led to tension. \n\nThe friend's GF is upset, and the author is being compared to anti-SJW types. The author says they've avoided the group because of the hostility. But the key is whether the author's disbelief in genderfluidity is inherently wrong. In many communities, especially progressive ones, respecting someone's identity is prioritized over personal beliefs. So even if someone doesn't believe in genderfluidity, they're expected to respect the individual's choice. \n\nThe author apologized and affirmed respect, so they're not being actively harmful. However, the fact that they openly expressed disbelief, even once and under the influence, caused hurt feelings. The question is about being in the wrong. In this context, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of malicious intent, but they might be lacking in social sensitivity. However, the answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, expressing personal beliefs that clash with a friend's identity can be seen as problematic, even if done privately. The friend's GF took it as an issue, and the author's actions caused a rift. So, the community might lean towards A, but the author did apologize and respect the friend. However, the core issue is the disbelief itself. If the author is not respecting the friend's identity, even if they're not being overtly hostile, that could be seen as wrong. But if they're respecting the person despite their beliefs, maybe not. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The author isn't denying the friend's identity in practice\u2014they just don't believe in the concept. But in many social contexts, respecting someone's identity is about acknowledging their self-perception, not one's own beliefs. So, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting the friend's self-identification, even if they don't believe in the concept. Therefore, the answer might be A. But others might argue that personal beliefs aren't the issue as long as the person is treated respectfully. The author says they respect the friend regardless. However, the friend and their partner felt targeted. So, maybe AITA leans towards the author being an asshole because their disbelief caused harm even if unintentional. So, Answer A.\n"
