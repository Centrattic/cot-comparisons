Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some issues with their friend's identity. The author mentions that they are usually left-leaning and don't oppose equal rights, but they personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion when they were stoned, and the friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, in this case, they made a comment while under the influence and later apologized. The friend's partner accused them of being part of the problem, which led the author to avoid the group because they felt hostility. The author also mentions the group being overly sensitive, similar to Tumblr's culture. They feel targeted in jokes about anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social justice perspective, respecting someone's identity is usually considered important. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with a concept like genderfluidity, it's often seen as necessary to respect others' self-identified labels. The author did apologize and said they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. But the fact that they publicly expressed doubt, even when stoned, might have hurt feelings. The friend changing names and identities frequently could be a sign of exploring their identity, but others might see it as insincere. However, the author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity and the resulting conflict.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group could be seen as self-preservation if they're uncomfortable with the group's dynamics. But the key point is whether expressing personal beliefs, even if they don't align with mainstream views, is wrong. In many cases, people are encouraged to hold their views privately unless it directly affects others. However, if the comment was made in a context where it caused harm, even if unintentionally, then the author might bear some responsibility. The apology was given, which is a positive step, but the ongoing avoidance suggests lingering tension.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that hurt their friend, even if they later apologized. Respecting others' identities is generally prioritized in such discussions, regardless of personal beliefs. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their beliefs and only expressed them once, especially while stoned. However, the impact on the friend and the resulting conflict could tip the balance towards A.\n"
