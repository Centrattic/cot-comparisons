Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nThe author says they're very left-leaning and an atheist, so they don't oppose equal rights. They mention that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing it. The problem arose when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, and then the friend's GF publicly called them out, implying the author was being an asshole. The friend has been changing names, sometimes using male pronouns or their birth name. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has since avoided the group due to feeling hostility. They apologized for any hurt feelings and respect their friends regardless of personal belief. Now they're being mocked for being an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are the author's disbelief in genderfluidity but not opposing equal rights. The author's main issue is that they don't believe in it, but they don't oppose the rights of people who identify that way. However, they made a comment when stoned and under influence, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, even if you personally don't agree with it. The author's problem isn't with the friend's identity per se, but with the concept of genderfluidity. But when someone's identity is being challenged, even if the challenge is based on personal belief, it can be hurtful. The author apologized and affirmed respect, so maybe they're not being intentionally harmful. However, the act of publicly stating disbelief, even once, can be seen as invalidating the person's experience.\n\nThe friend's GF's reaction might be part of the issue. If they are part of a group that is very sensitive or \"coddled\" as the author puts it, they might react strongly to any dissenting opinion. The author might feel targeted because of their private beliefs, but public statements about someone's identity can be hurtful regardless of intent.\n\nLegally, the author isn't violating any laws, but socially, they might be violating norms of respect for personal identity. The question is whether the author is wrong in expressing their personal disbelief, especially when it's done in a context where it causes distress.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were stoned when they made the comment. That could affect judgment, but it's not an excuse for hurtful behavior. The fact that they apologized afterward is a mitigating factor, but the damage might already be done.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's behavior. The friend changing names and identities frequently might be seen by some as insincere or attention-seeking, but that's not for the author to judge. The author's right to hold their beliefs is balanced against the need to respect others' identities.\n\nIn summary, while the author may not be a malicious person and does support equal rights, their public expression of disbelief in genderfluidity, even if under the influence, can be hurtful and disrespectful. The fact that they apologized shows they recognize the impact, but the action itself could be seen as the asshole moment, especially if it led to the friend's GF and others treating them poorly.\n"
