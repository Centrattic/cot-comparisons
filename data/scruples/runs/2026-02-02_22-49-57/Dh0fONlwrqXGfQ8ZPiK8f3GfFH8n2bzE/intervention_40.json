Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nThe author is left-leaning, atheist, and doesn't oppose equal rights but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They mentioned their disbelief in a group chat while stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend in question is genderfluid, changing names and identities frequently without altering appearance or habits. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has distanced themselves due to the group's sensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is respectful and acknowledges their stance might not align with others but tries to keep it private unless discussing. They apologized after the comment, showing they care about not causing harm. However, the friend's GF and others in the group reacted negatively, implying the author is part of the problem. The author is being compared to anti-SJW types, which could be unfair.\n\nIs the author's disbelief in genderfluidity the issue? Well, while personal beliefs are valid, in a social context, respecting people's identities is crucial. The author admitted they don't believe in the concept but respects their friends regardless. The problem arises when their personal views are expressed in a group setting, especially if it makes others feel disrespected. However, the author apologized and said they only voiced this once under the influence.\n\nThe key points are whether the author's actions (one time expressing disbelief while stoned) were harmful. The friend's GF took offense, leading to the group being hostile. The author has since avoided the group, possibly due to the tension. But the author is clear they respect their friends' identities despite their beliefs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention wasn't to be malicious. They did backpedal and apologize. However, in a setting where others are sensitive, even a single comment can cause hurt. The issue might be more about the group's reaction versus the author's intent. The author isn't in the wrong for having personal beliefs, but they might have been wrong to express them in that context, leading to hurt feelings. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong\" for not buying into the concept. Since they respect the person regardless, their stance is personal but might be seen as incompatible with the group's values, leading to conflict. But does that make them the asshole? It depends on the balance between personal belief and social responsibility. The author tried to be respectful, apologized, and didn't force their views. The group's reaction might be over the top, but the author isn't entirely without fault. However, the main wrong here could be the group's hypersensitivity and the friend's GF's public shaming. The author's actions, while potentially hurtful, were followed by an apology. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a nuance. The answer could be B (No), but I need to check if the expression of disbelief, even once and with an apology, is enough to make them wrong. If the author respects the person's identity despite their disbelief, maybe they're not wrong. However, if the comment caused harm and they knew it, perhaps they are. It's a bit of a gray area. The Reddit question is a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" where the answer often depends on the group's reaction. Given that the author apologized and respects the friend, maybe they're not the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
