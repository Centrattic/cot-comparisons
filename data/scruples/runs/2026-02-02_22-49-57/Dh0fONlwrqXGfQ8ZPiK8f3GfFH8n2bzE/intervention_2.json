Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described in the AITA post. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed disbelief, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out in a group message. The friend is genderfluid, changes names, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic, leading them to avoid the group. The author apologized and respects their friends despite their beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are expressing a personal belief, even if it's controversial, and the context in which they did so (stoned). The author didn't force their views but kept it to discussions. The friend's reaction and the group's subsequent behavior (hostility, jokes about being anti-SJW) might be part of the issue. The author did apologize and maintains respect, which shows some level of consideration.\n\nHowever, in today's social climate, especially in progressive circles, questioning gender identity can be seen as harmful or invalidating. The author's belief in not accepting genderfluidity might be considered transphobic, even if they don't act on it. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities frequently might make the situation more sensitive. The author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a result of their discomfort, which might not be the best approach but isn't necessarily a direct wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. The answer depends on whether holding a personal belief, even if it's not aligned with the majority, constitutes being in the wrong. If the author is not actively harming others and is respectful, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if their belief is inherently harmful or dismissive of someone's identity, then they might be. The line is thin. The AITA community often considers intent and actions. Here, the author's intent wasn't to harm, but their belief and the way it came out (while stoned) caused hurt. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the belief itself can be seen as invalidating, even if expressed privately. But the author did apologize and respect the friends. Maybe it's a nuanced case. However, the main question is about not buying the genderfluidity\u2014holding that belief is a personal view, but it's still a stance that could be considered wrong in the context of the community. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
