Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. The situation is that the author, who identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, is part of a group where a friend is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but usually keeps it to themselves except during a stoned conversation where they made a comment. The friend's girlfriend took offense, leading to tension. The author now feels the group is being overly sensitive and avoids them, while others mock them for not being anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's personal beliefs versus their treatment of friends. The author claims not to oppose equal rights but personally doesn't accept genderfluidity. They made a comment under the influence and apologized. However, the friend's partner feels targeted by the author's comment, leading to the group being hostile. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not accepting genderfluidity. Legally and socially, respecting someone's identity is important. Even if someone personally disagrees, treating others with respect is expected. The author's comment, even if made in a private conversation, might have caused hurt, especially if it was brought up publicly by the friend's partner. The author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a self-defense mechanism but might also contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe line between holding personal beliefs and respecting others' identities is crucial. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive, which might be harmful. Even if they apologized, the act of expressing disbelief in a close friend's identity could be hurtful. The group's reaction, while perhaps over-sensitive, is also about their lived experiences. The author's use of \"not buying\" suggests a lack of acceptance, which can be problematic in a supportive relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions\u2014expressing disbelief in someone's identity and causing discomfort\u2014likely contribute to the problem. Even if they respect the person's rights, not accepting their identity can still be hurtful. So, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
