Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is an asshole (AITA) for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author is someone who's described as being left-leaning, an atheist, and supportive of equal rights. They mention that they keep their disbelief in genderfluidity to themselves unless discussing it, but there was an instance when they were stoned and said they don't believe in it. The friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message, and the author apologized and affirmed respect. However, the author feels hostility from the group because they think the friend is being histrionic and not making clear changes in appearance or habits. The friend has changed their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or male pronouns. The author has avoided the group and is now being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's public statement of disbelief, even if they apologized, and the resulting tension. The author is questioning if their stance is wrong. The friend's partner seems to feel targeted, and the group is following a more sensitive approach, which the author finds over-coddling.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal beliefs. Gender identity is a sensitive topic. Even if someone doesn't believe in a particular identity, respecting a person's self-identification is often considered important. The author did publicly state their disbelief, even if under the influence, which might have hurt the friend. However, they apologized and clarified their respect. \n\nThe author's avoidance of the group might be due to discomfort, but it's not clear if they directly confronted the friend or tried to understand the situation more. The friend's behavior (changing names, inconsistent identity) might be part of a personal journey, which the author might be misinterpreting as histrionic.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's statement could be seen as disrespectful, but they did acknowledge their mistake. However, continuing to distance themselves and allowing the group to treat them as an antagonist could be problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions (stating disbelief, then avoiding) were hurtful despite their apology. Since the friend's partner and others are sensitive to this, the author might have overstepped by expressing their disbelief, even if they later apologized. \n\nIn many communities, especially those that value social justice, expressing skepticism about someone's identity can be seen as invalidating and harmful, regardless of personal beliefs. So even if the author doesn't personally oppose equal rights, their words might have caused pain, and the subsequent avoidance might be seen as not taking responsibility adequately. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the initial statement and the resulting behavior.\n"
