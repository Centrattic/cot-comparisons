Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author identifies as very left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights but personally disagreeing with the concept of genderfluidity. They had a friend who transitioned and another who identified as genderfluid. The friend's GF accused the author of being an asshole, and there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions. In one instance, while stoned, they expressed this disbelief in a group chat. The GF of the genderfluid friend took offense, and the author later apologized and affirmed respect. Now, the author is being criticized as an \"asshole\" by the group, which the author feels is unfair, comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe key points here are: the author expressed a personal belief in a context where it might have been inappropriate, especially under the influence. However, they later apologized. The question is whether this makes them the asshole. From a social perspective, even if someone's beliefs differ, public expressions of disbelief, especially when it's a core part of someone's identity, can be hurtful. The fact that the author apologized shows they recognize the impact, but the initial statement might have caused harm. The group's reaction could be seen as protective of their friend's identity. So, while the author might not be malicious, their statement could be considered disrespectful, making them at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
