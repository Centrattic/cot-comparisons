Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and facing backlash.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're left-leaning and support equal rights. They say they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. The issue here is their personal belief about genderfluidity. The key point is that the author has kept their views private unless in a discussion, which they had while under the influence. \n\nThe friend in question is genderfluid, but the author doesn't believe in the concept. The friend's GF accused the author of being an asshole, and there's some speculation about the friend trying out being trans. The author also notes that the friend changes names and sometimes uses their birth name or male pronouns. The author feels the friend is histrionic and avoids the group due to their hostility towards the friend's perceived sensitivity and coddling.\n\nThe author did apologize for any hurt feelings and affirmed respect. The main conflict is between the author's personal beliefs and the friends' reactions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding these views, even if they keep them to themselves except in discussions.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's important to respect people's identities. However, the author isn't actively disrespecting the friend; they're just not buying into the concept. The line is between personal belief and actionable discrimination. The author isn't attacking the friend but has personal doubts. However, expressing disbelief, especially in a group context, can still be hurtful. The author did apologize, but the friend's GF and others in the group are upset.\n\nSociety generally values respecting others' identities, even if one doesn't personally agree. The author's actions led to social consequences, like being the butt of jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience, which can contribute to a hostile environment. Even if the author isn't enforcing discrimination, their disbelief and the resulting avoidance could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance personal beliefs with respect for others. They apologized and affirm respect. But the issue is whether not buying into the concept is enough to be considered wrong. The answer hinges on whether respecting someone's identity requires accepting the concept itself, even if one personally doesn't believe in it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's belief isn't inherently wrong, but acting on that belief in a way that harms relationships or invalidates someone's identity could make them at fault. The key is whether their actions crossed into disrespect or harm. The author's avoidance and the friend's GF's hostility suggest that the author's stance caused issues despite their personal respect.\n"
