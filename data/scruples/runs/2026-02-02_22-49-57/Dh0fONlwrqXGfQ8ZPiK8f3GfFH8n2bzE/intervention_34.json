Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is presented through an AITA post. The author is a left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights but doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion where they expressed their disbelief while under the influence, which led to being called out by their friend's girlfriend. The author apologized and clarified they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The conflict arose when they made a public comment under the influence, leading to the friend's GF expressing concern. The author then avoided the group due to feeling hostility, which they associate with Tumblr's oversensitivity. The main question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in today's climate, personal beliefs about gender identity can be sensitive. Even if someone holds differing views, how they express them matters. The author did express their disbelief, which the friend found hurtful. While the author apologized and stated respect, the act of not acknowledging someone's identity can be seen as invalidating. However, the author also mentions they don't oppose equal rights, so their stance might be more about personal belief rather than discrimination.\n\nThe friend changing names and identities multiple times might add complexity. If the friend is perceived as being histrionic, it could affect how the author views the situation. However, the author's public comment, even under influence, might have caused harm, regardless of intent. The author's avoidance of the group post-incident might be seen as self-imposed isolation due to discomfort, which could be a reaction to the group's sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is typically expected in modern discourse. Even if one doesn't personally believe in a concept, respecting a person's self-identification is crucial. The author's statement of not buying into genderfluidity could be seen as dismissive. However, the author did apologize and affirm their respect, so they might be trying to balance their beliefs with social harmony.\n\nThe friend's GF's reaction is also a factor. If she's projecting or being overly sensitive, that could contribute to the conflict. But the author's comment did directly address the friend's identity, which might be the root issue. The author might not be in the wrong if they're being honest about their beliefs while still supporting the friend's rights. However, the way they expressed it led to hurt feelings, so there's a possible wrongdoing in the method rather than the belief itself.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's public expression of disbelief under influence and the subsequent fallout could be seen as problematic, even if their intentions were not malicious. The key is whether the author's actions harmed the friend's well-being. If the friend felt invalidated, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author is just holding personal beliefs without actively discriminating, they might not be. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points, but the act of expressing disbelief in a public context likely contributed to the conflict.\n"
