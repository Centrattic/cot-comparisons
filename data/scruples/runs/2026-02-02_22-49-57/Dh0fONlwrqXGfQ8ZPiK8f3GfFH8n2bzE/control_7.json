Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves except during discussions. They were stoned when they mentioned this, and their friend's girlfriend called them out, implying the friend might be experimenting with being trans. The friend changes names a lot and seems inconsistent with their identity. The author now avoids the group because they feel hostile and the group is too sensitive. The author apologized and respects their friends regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance is not buying into genderfluidity but isn't vocal about it unless discussing. However, they made a comment when stoned, which led to conflict. The friend's partner is upset, and the group is perceived as being overly sensitive, comparing them to anti-SJW types. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about respecting others' identities and the context of the conversation. Even if the author has their own beliefs, if a friend identifies as genderfluid, it's important to respect that. The fact that the author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves is one thing, but the comment made when stoned led to hurt feelings. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful, and the author did apologize and affirm respect. However, the avoidance of the group might be a reaction to feeling hostility, but maybe the author should have handled the situation better. The author's belief doesn't negate the friend's identity. Even if the author thinks the friend is being histrionic, it's not their place to judge. The key here is whether the author's comment, even when stoned, was a breach of respect towards the friend's self-identified gender. Since the author apologized and respects their friends regardless, maybe they aren't being an asshole. But if the comment was made in a group where it's sensitive and caused hurt, maybe the author should have been more cautious. The answer depends on whether expressing doubt about someone's gender identity is considered harmful, even if done once and in a private context. In many cases, respecting someone's identity is expected regardless of personal beliefs. So the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief, even if it's a private opinion. However, the fact that they apologized and don't oppose equal rights might mitigate that. Hmm. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If respecting someone's gender identity is a social expectation, then not believing in the concept could be seen as problematic, even if they keep it to themselves. The author's comment under the influence led to further issues, so maybe the author is at fault here. Answer A.\n"
