Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author questioning their friend's genderfluid identity and backing away from the group because of it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They were stoned when they made a comment, and their friend's partner called them out in a group message. The friend's name keeps changing, and they sometimes refer to themselves with different pronouns. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group, leading to jokes about them being anti-SJW.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity but are respectful. They made a comment under the influence, apologized, and still respect their friends. The issue is whether not buying into someone's identity is wrong, especially when it comes to gender.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, respecting someone's self-identified gender is generally considered important. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept like genderfluidity, it's about affirming the person's identity. The author's avoidance and the subsequent jokes might be seen as harmful, even if they don't agree. \n\nBut the author claims they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. However, the fact that they were called out and the group is being hostile towards them might be a result of the author's stance conflicting with the group's values. The author's actions, like avoiding the group and making them a target of jokes, could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nIt's possible that the author's initial comment about not believing in genderfluidity, even if made under the influence, caused hurt feelings and led to the group's reaction. The fact that the author's friend's partner speculated the friend was trying out being trans might add complexity, suggesting that the friend's identity is fluid or in flux, which can be a sensitive area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author is allowed to have their own beliefs, respecting others' identities is typically considered a social norm. Not acknowledging someone's gender identity can be hurtful, even if done without malice. The author's avoidance might be a way to avoid conflict, but it could also be seen as withdrawing support, which can be damaging to the relationship.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they are being respectful despite their beliefs. However, the impact of their words and actions on their friends is significant. The key is whether their actions caused harm, which they seem to have done, leading to the friend's partner's direct criticism and the group's hostility towards them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their disbelief in the friend's identity, even if personal, led to hurt feelings and conflict, especially in a group that values such identities highly. The author's avoidance and the subsequent jokes suggest a lack of support, which is problematic even if the belief isn't in the wrong.\n"
