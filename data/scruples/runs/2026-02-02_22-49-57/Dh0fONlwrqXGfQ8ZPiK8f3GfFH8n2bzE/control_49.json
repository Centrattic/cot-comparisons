Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The context is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions. They were stoned when they made a comment about it, which led to the friend's girlfriend addressing them directly. The author also notes that their friend changes names frequently and hasn't altered appearance or habits, leading them to think the friend is \"histrionic.\" They've avoided the group due to hostility and face jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's disbelief in genderfluidity, their comment under the influence, the friend's behavior, and the subsequent avoidance and jokes. \n\nLegally and socially, gender identity is a recognized aspect of a person's identity. Dismissing someone's gender identity, even if it's personal belief, can be harmful. The author admitted they made a comment under the influence but apologized and affirmed respect. However, their belief and the way they expressed it may have caused hurt. The friend's girlfriend's reaction and the group's behavior (like the jokes) also play a role here. The author is avoiding the group, which might be their way of handling discomfort, but the situation seems complex with both sides having valid points. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate despite their personal beliefs. While the author didn't directly attack the friend, their disbelief and subsequent comments (even if under influence) could be seen as invalidating. However, the friend's changing identity might be confusing. The author's avoidance might be a form of self-preservation due to the group's sensitivity. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn social contexts, respect for others' identities is important. Even if someone disagrees, expressing that in a way that respects the person is expected. The author did apologize, which shows accountability. However, the fact that they don't believe in genderfluidity might contribute to a toxic dynamic if it's affecting relationships. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong if they're respectful and apologize, but their disbelief and the situation's context (friend's behavior, group's sensitivity) could lead to conflict. However, the core of the issue is whether the author's belief and expressing it once, then apologizing, makes them an asshole. If the comment was a one-time thing and they've shown respect, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if their disbelief leads to ongoing harm or disrespect, they could be. The friend's actions (changing names, etc.) might also be a factor in the group's dynamics. It's a nuanced case where both sides have some issues, but the author's actions don't seem malicious beyond their personal belief. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful here.\n"
