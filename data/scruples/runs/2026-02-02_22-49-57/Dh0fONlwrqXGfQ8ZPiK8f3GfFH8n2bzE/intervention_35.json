Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're on the left, atheist, and support equal rights. They don't oppose it even if they disagree. They keep their disbelief private unless discussing it. \n\nThen there's a situation where the friend's girlfriend mentions the author specifically in a group message asking for support. The friend changed names multiple times and the author thinks they're being histrionic. The author avoided the group due to hostility, and now faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe author did say they don't believe in genderfluidity once while stoned, apologized, and said they respect the friends. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points are whether the author's disbelief is a legitimate issue. Even if they believe it's not real, they're not forcing others to accept it, just expressing their view. But when someone's identity is involved, especially with a friend, does expressing that disbelief cross a line? The fact that the friend's partner called out the author might matter. Also, the author avoided the group due to hostility\u2014maybe the friend's side is being overly sensitive? \n\nBut from a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is usually considered important, even if you don't agree. The author's public statement about not believing in genderfluidity, even if under the influence, might have hurt the friend's feelings. Even if they apologized, the action might have caused rift. The friend changing names and identity could be part of their self-discovery. The author's avoidance might have exacerbated tensions.\n\nBut the author is saying they don't oppose equal rights. They're just not personally buying it. The problem is whether expressing that disbelief is acceptable. In some circles, especially where there's a strong emphasis on respecting identities, stating disbelief could be seen as harmful, even if done in a private discussion. \n\nThe author is in a group where the friend's partner is against such comments. The author's behavior might have been the trigger for the conflict. Even if they apologized, the impact of their words might have caused the friend to feel invalidated. So even if the author's intention was just to express a personal belief without malice, the effect might have been negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't trying to hurt, just expressing honest disbelief. However, in matters of identity, personal beliefs aren't always the priority. The community might expect more support regardless of personal views. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their statement could have hurt the friend and led to the conflict. Even if they apologized, the action itself might be seen as not respecting the friend's identity. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
