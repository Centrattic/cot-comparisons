Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They mention being a leftist and atheist, so they're likely supportive of many social issues. But they have a personal disbelief in genderfluidity. The key here is that they keep their views to themselves unless discussing, which is a respectful approach.\n\nThey were introduced to a group of friends, including a couple where one is MTF (male-to-female) and the other is genderfluid. The genderfluid friend changed their name four times and sometimes slips up. The author once said they don't believe in genderfluidity while stoned, and the girlfriend called them out. They apologized and affirmed respect for their friend's identity.\n\nThe author now avoids the group because of the perceived hostility from friends who are part of a \"Tumblr\" culture that's oversensitive. They also mention being the target of jokes comparing them to \"anti-SJW\" types.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). The author's main actions are expressing a personal belief in a private context (possibly under the influence), apologizing when called out, and avoiding the group afterward. They don't seem to be actively harming the friend, but their disbelief in genderfluidity could be problematic even if kept private.\n\nIn many discussions about gender identity, respecting others' self-identified labels is considered important. If the author is not respecting the friend's identity by openly doubting it, even if it's a personal belief, that could be seen as harmful. The fact that they apologized shows they recognized the issue, but their continued avoidance and the jokes suggest they might be making the friend feel ostracized. \n\nHowever, the author claims they only mentioned their disbelief once and in context. The friend might be oversensitive, but the author is also admitting they caused hurt feelings. The key point is whether expressing a personal belief, even if it's not aligned with the friend's identity, is enough to be labeled as the asshole. In most cases, respecting others' identities, regardless of personal beliefs, is expected in friendships. The author's avoidance might be a result of feeling uncomfortable rather than malicious intent, but the impact on the friend is still significant. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong for having beliefs, but their actions (expressing disbelief, causing hurt, and avoiding the group) could be seen as problematic. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just causing hurt. If the author was not actively opposing the friend's rights but just expressing a personal belief, they might not be the asshole. But if their disbelief led to harm and avoidance, it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural context and how the friend perceived the statement. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because not buying someone's gender identity, even if personal, can be hurtful and shows a lack of respect for their self-expression. However, the author did apologize and keep their views private, which could mitigate it. But in terms of the community's perspective, especially on Reddit's AITA, the consensus often leans towards respecting others' identities, so the author might be considered in the wrong.\n"
