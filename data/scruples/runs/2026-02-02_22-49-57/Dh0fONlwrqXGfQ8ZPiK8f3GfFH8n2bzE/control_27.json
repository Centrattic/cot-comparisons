Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author says they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep their opinions to themselves unless discussing. They mention being introduced to friends, one of whom is genderfluid. The friend's girlfriend (GF) sent a group message asking for support, specifically naming the author. The GF also privately speculated that the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and avoids the group because they feel hostile, noting that the group is following a \"over-sensitivity\" and \"coddling ethos\" from Tumblr. The author admits to once saying they don't believe in genderfluidity while stoned, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. Now they're being mocked as a \"mean anti-SJW.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's stance: they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had one comment under the influence, apologized, and affirmed respect. So, they're trying to be respectful despite their beliefs. However, the friend's GF took offense and called out the author specifically. The author feels the group is being overly sensitive.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, respecting others' identities is usually key. The author says they're on the left and support equal rights, but their personal disbelief might conflict with respecting the individual's identity. The key here is whether not believing in a concept makes one wrong, especially if it's hurtful to others.\n\nThe author made a comment under the influence, which they apologized for. But the GF took it as a direct issue and mentioned the author by name. The author is now avoiding the group due to perceived hostility. The friends might feel that the author's disbelief is dismissive of their friend's identity, leading to hurt feelings. The author's avoidance could be seen as them isolating themselves, but they might feel justified if they're being unfairly targeted.\n\nIn many cases, supporting someone's identity is considered separate from personal belief. Even if you don't personally believe in a concept (like some people not believing in certain spiritual beliefs) but you respect others' rights to hold those beliefs. The author's issue is not with the friend's gender identity itself but with the concept of genderfluidity. However, by not buying into it, they might be invalidating the friend's experience, which can be harmful.\n\nThe author says they respect their friends regardless, but the fact that they don't believe in the concept could lead to microaggressions or not taking the friend's identity seriously. The friend changing names and identities might be part of their personal journey, and the author's skepticism could be seen as undermining that process.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a situation where they're being attacked for their beliefs, called an SJW, and the group seems to have a hostile reaction. They tried to apologize, but the GF's message might have escalated things. The author's stance is that they don't want to be in the group due to the hostility, which could be a valid reason if the environment is toxic.\n\nBut from a broader perspective, respecting someone's gender identity is a standard of being a good friend. If the author's disbelief leads to not supporting their friend's identity, even if they say they respect them, it's a problem. The author's comments, even if made under the influence once, might have caused hurt, leading the friend and GF to feel disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for not believing in genderfluidity but trying to be respectful? Well, beliefs are personal, but acting in a way that respects others' identities is expected. If the author's disbelief translates into not acknowledging the friend's identity, that's where they're in the wrong. The fact that the friend is changing names and identity might be part of their journey, and the author's skepticism could be a barrier to support.\n\nBut the author apologizes and says they respect their friends regardless. The key here is whether respecting someone's identity is separate from personal belief. In many social contexts, yes, it is. So even if you don't believe in the concept, respecting someone's self-identified gender is the socially accepted standard. Therefore, the author's disbelief, while their own opinion, could be considered problematic if it leads to not supporting their friend's identity.\n\nThe fact that the GF took it personally and the group seems to be more sensitive might mean the author's comment was out of line, even if made in a discussion. The author's avoidance might be a result of feeling targeted, but the initial comment could have been hurtful regardless of intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because respecting someone's gender identity is separate from personal beliefs, and not doing so can be hurtful and dismissive, even if the author claims to support equal rights. The author's actions (comment) under the influence led to hurt feelings, and their continued avoidance might stem from the group's reaction, but their initial stance could be seen as invalidating their friend's identity.\n"
