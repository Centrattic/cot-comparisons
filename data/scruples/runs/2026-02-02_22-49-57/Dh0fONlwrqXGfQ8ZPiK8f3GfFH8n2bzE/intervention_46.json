Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a friend who identifies as genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves except in discussions. The key points here are the author's personal beliefs, their actions, and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about their left-leaning and atheist views, and they state they don't oppose equal rights. That's important because it suggests they might be open-minded in general. However, the issue arises when they express doubt about genderfluidity. The friend's girlfriend is upset and called out the author publicly, even though the author apologized and said they respect the friend regardless of their personal belief. \n\nThe author mentions they were stoned during the discussion where they expressed their disbelief. That could be a factor in how the comment was made or perceived, but it's not the main issue. The main point is whether questioning someone's gender identity is acceptable, even if done in private. \n\nAlso, the friend seems to be changing their name frequently and slipping up on their identity, which the author interprets as histrionic behavior. The author has distanced themselves from the group because of the hostility they faced. The group, according to the author, follows a \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr,\" which might explain their reactions. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial act of expressing disbelief in a private context, while not ideal, may not be inherently wrong if done respectfully. However, the issue could be in the tone or context of the discussion. Even if the author apologized, the act of not buying into a friend's identity can be hurtful, especially in a community that values such identities as important. \n\nThe friend's name changes and identity slips might be part of their personal journey or a genuine struggle, which the author is dismissing as histrionic. This could be a judgment call, but it's possible the author is misinterpreting the friend's behavior. The author's avoidance of the group due to perceived hostility is a reaction, but it might also be a way to avoid confrontation or further discussion. \n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in more progressive circles, there's an expectation to respect people's identities even if one personally disagrees. The author's friend and their partner might feel that the author's disbelief undermines their experience. So, while the author claims not to be opposing equal rights, their personal belief could still be causing harm, even if they're not outwardly discriminatory. \n\nI think the key here is whether expressing doubt about someone's gender identity is considered harmful, regardless of the author's intent. In many cases, people are advised to use the correct names and pronouns even if they don't personally agree with the identity, to show respect and support. The author's refusal to believe in the concept, even in a private setting, might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. \n\nSo, while the author might not have the intent to be harmful, their actions (expressing disbelief and then avoiding the group) could be seen as inconsiderate or damaging to the friendship. The fact that the friend's partner specifically called them out in a group message suggests that the community they're part of takes such issues seriously. \n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention was to have a discussion, the impact of their words and the resulting avoidance might place them in the wrong. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
