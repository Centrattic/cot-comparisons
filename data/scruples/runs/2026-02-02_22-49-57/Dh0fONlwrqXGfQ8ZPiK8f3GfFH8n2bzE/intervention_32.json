Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The author identifies as left-leaning, an atheist, and supports equal rights. But they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a situation where a friend's partner accused them, in a group message, of being an asshole for not buying into their partner's genderfluid identity. The friend's partner also speculated that the author thinks the friend is \"trying out being trans.\" The author mentioned not believing in the concept once, under the influence of drugs, and later apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal disbelief in genderfluidity, their statement under the influence, the friend's partner's accusation, and the author's subsequent actions of avoiding the group due to hostility. The author is seeking whether they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nNow, considering societal norms and current discussions around gender identity, many people believe that respecting someone's identity is crucial, even if one doesn't personally agree with it. The author stated they don't oppose equal rights, but their personal belief leads them to not accept genderfluidity. However, the act of not believing doesn't necessarily make them wrong if they're respectful. The issue might be in how they expressed their disbelief, especially under the influence, leading to hurt feelings and group conflict.\n\nThe author apologized and affirmed respect, which is important. But the question is whether their disbelief is a valid stance or if it's harmful to the friend's identity. Some might argue that the author is being dismissive of a valid identity, which could be considered hurtful, even if not intentionally. Others might say that holding personal beliefs without acting maliciously isn't wrong, especially if they're not discriminating.\n\nThe friend's partner's reaction might be part of a more sensitive environment, especially if they're part of a group that's highly sensitive to such issues. The author's avoidance could be seen as self-preservation but might also contribute to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the line between holding personal beliefs and respecting others' identities is delicate. The author's actions don't seem to be overtly harmful beyond expressing their belief once, albeit under the influence. The main issue is whether their disbelief in genderfluidity is a personal opinion versus a harmful stance. Since the author respects their friends regardless, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if respecting their friend's identity is part of being supportive, then maybe they are in the wrong for not accepting it. However, acceptance vs. belief might be different. Acceptance can mean respecting someone's identity even if you don't personally agree.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether not believing in an identity is considered invalid or if respecting the person despite not believing is sufficient. In many current contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered essential, regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting their friend's identity, even if they respect them otherwise. But if they're not actively opposing it, maybe they're not. This is tricky. The author's statement under the influence led to conflict, so maybe they are in the wrong for causing hurt even unintentionally.\n"
