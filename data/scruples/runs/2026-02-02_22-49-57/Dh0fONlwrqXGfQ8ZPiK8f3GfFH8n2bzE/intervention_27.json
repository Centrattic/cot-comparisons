Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning and supports equal rights but personally doesn't buy into the concept of genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, made a comment about not believing in it, and later apologized. The friend's significant other called out the author, and the author has been avoiding the group because they feel hostility. The friends are labeled as following \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr,\" which might imply they're being very sensitive about social justice issues.\n\nThe author's main actions are expressing their personal disbelief in genderfluidity, which they kept to themselves unless discussing. The problem arose when they were stoned and made the comment, then apologized. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying into genderfluidity, even if they respect others' identities.\n\nI need to consider the context of personal beliefs versus respecting others. The author says they respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs. However, the issue is that their comment was made in a group chat and led to hurt feelings. The author did apologize, so maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing their opinion, which is their right. But in a society that values gender identity, stating disbelief in someone's identity (like genderfluidity) can be hurtful, even if they claim not to oppose equal rights. The friends might feel that the author is invalidating their identity, even if they say they respect them.\n\nThe author mentions the friend changing names and identities, which might make the author question the authenticity. However, personal identity is complex, and others' experiences shouldn't be judged based on that. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility could be a response to the friends' overreaction, but maybe they should have handled it differently.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's personal disbelief translates to being in the wrong. If the author is respecting the friend's identity despite not personally believing in genderfluidity, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the comment was dismissive of the friend's identity, that could be problematic. The fact that the author apologized and affirms respect might show they aren't being malicious. But the public nature of the comment (in a group chat) and the friend's GF pointing out the author specifically might indicate that the comment was more hurtful than intended.\n\nIn modern social contexts, even if someone has personal doubts, expressing those can be seen as harmful if it undermines someone's identity. The author's stance might be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim not to oppose equal rights. So, the answer could depend on whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity is considered wrong, regardless of personal respect.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even if they respect the person, stating disbelief in their gender identity can be hurtful and invalidating. The author's comment, even if made under the influence and later apologized for, contributed to the conflict. The friends' reaction, while possibly over-sensitive, is about feeling that their identity is being disrespected. Therefore, the author's actions led to the problem, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
