Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even when they disagree. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves unless discussing. The issue arose when they made a comment under the influence of being stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out in a group message. The friend's GF speculated the friend might be \"trying out being trans,\" and the author's comment was taken as dismissive.\n\nThe author apologized and affirmed respect, but there's ongoing tension. The friends seem to be part of a more sensitive, perhaps Tumblr-like community, and the author feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. The main question is whether the author's initial statement, even if made under the influence and later apologized for, was wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author did express disbelief in genderfluidity once, in a discussion, and under the influence. They did apologize and clarified their respect. However, even if the statement was made in a private or semi-private setting, if it was hurtful and led to the friend feeling unsupported, that could be problematic. The key here is whether the author's belief itself is wrong or if the manner of expressing it was the issue.\n\nGenderfluidity is a recognized gender identity where a person's gender identity can change over time. Dismissing someone's identity can be hurtful, regardless of the speaker's personal beliefs. The author's friend changing names and identities might indicate they're exploring their gender, and the author's disbelief could invalidate that experience. Even if the author apologized, the initial statement might have caused harm, especially in a close group where acceptance is expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. They only expressed their personal view once and later apologized. However, in social contexts where respecting others' identities is paramount, the mere expression of disbelief, even in a private conversation, might be seen as crossing a line, especially when the friend is actively navigating their identity.\n\nSo, considering that the author's comment was directed towards a friend who was in a vulnerable position (exploring their gender identity), and the comment led to conflict despite an apology, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not affirming their friend's identity, even if they have their own beliefs. The wrong isn't necessarily about the belief itself but about how it was expressed and its impact on the friend's experience.\n"
