Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The main issue is the author expressing disbelief in genderfluidity and whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as very left and an atheist, supporting equal rights. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. But they personally don't believe in genderfluidity. The friend in question is genderfluid, and the author was stoned when they made this comment. The friend's partner called out the author, leading to some tension. The author apologized but still feels targeted as an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author expressed a personal belief they don't believe in genderfluidity, even though they say they respect the person. The context is that the author was under the influence when they said this. The group is described as oversensitive, and the author avoids them now. The author apologized but is still being mocked in comparison to anti-SJW people.\n\nNow, considering social norms and the principles of respect and acceptance. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with another's identity, it's generally expected to respect it to avoid causing harm. The author did express their disbelief, even if in a private discussion. The fact that they were stoned might make the context a bit more casual, but it's still a personal belief that could be offensive. The friend's partner was hurt enough to call them out, and the author did apologize, which shows some accountability. However, the author's continued avoidance and the conflict that arose might indicate that their comment had a lasting negative impact.\n\nThe main ethical consideration is whether expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity is acceptable, even if done privately and followed by an apology. In most contemporary viewpoints, respecting someone's self-identified gender is a basic courtesy, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which can be hurtful. Even if the author claims to respect the person, the disbelief in their identity can feel dismissive or harmful.\n\nThe author's position might be seen as not being in the wrong because they apologized and respect the friend personally, but the act of not accepting the friend's gender identity could be considered wrong in the context of social expectations. The key is whether the author's belief expression crossed into harmful territory. The friend's reaction and the group's response suggest that the author's comment was harmful, even if unintended. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be seen as dismissive and harmful, even if done in a private context and with an apology. The author's continued avoidance and the resulting conflict indicate that their actions contributed to the problem, making them at least partially responsible."
