Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is posted as an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question on Reddit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the scenario. The author identifies as very left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights. They mention they don't necessarily believe in genderfluidity but usually keep their opinions private. The conflict arises when their friend's girlfriend (GF) publicly calls out the author in a group message, possibly implying the author is being an asshole. The author was under the influence when they expressed skepticism about genderfluidity and later apologized. The friend has been changing names and identities frequently without altering appearance or habits, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group due to feeling hostility, and others have compared them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, evaluating the ethical aspects. The author's stance is personal belief but might be considered insensitive. The key here is whether expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, even if kept private, is harmful. The author apologized and respects their friend regardless, but the friend's partner is upset, leading to group tension. The friend's actions of changing names and identities might indicate genuine exploration or inconsistency, but the author perceives it as performative. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author is in a tough spot. Publicly expressing disbelief could be seen as invalidating, but they did apologize. However, the fact that the friend's partner is upset and the group dynamics are tense suggests that the author's comments had an impact. The author's decision to avoid the group might be due to personal discomfort, but it could also be seen as avoiding conflict or not taking the friend's identity seriously. \n\nSocial norms and respect for personal identity are important here. Even if the author doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity, respecting others' self-identified labels is crucial in maintaining relationships and showing support. The author's public statement, even when stoned, might have crossed a line by not supporting their friend's identity, leading to the friend's GF feeling the need to defend their partner. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and clarified their respect. The friend's behavior of changing names and not altering habits might contribute to the author's skepticism. But in a supportive group, the expectation is mutual respect regardless of personal beliefs. The author's avoidance could be seen as a consequence of their own discomfort, which might not be entirely their fault, but the initial comment did cause harm.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions\u2014expressing disbelief in a public or semi-public context\u2014might be considered inconsiderate, even if they later apologized. The fact that the friend's partner is upset and the group dynamics are affected suggests that the author's stance is problematic. Therefore, the answer would likely lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting others' identities, even when one personally disagrees, is a social expectation, especially in close-knit groups.\n"
