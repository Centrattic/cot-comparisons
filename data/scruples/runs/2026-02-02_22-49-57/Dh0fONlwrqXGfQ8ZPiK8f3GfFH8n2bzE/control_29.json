Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone who identifies as genderfluid and the author not buying into that concept. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are left-leaning and don't oppose equal rights, which is a good sign. They keep their beliefs private unless discussing, but in a stoned state, they expressed not believing in genderfluidity. The friend's partner then accused them of being an asshole in a group message and speculated that the friend might be trying out being trans. The author has noticed the friend changing names multiple times and not altering appearance or habits, leading them to think the friend is histrionic. The author has since avoided the group due to hostility from their friends who are very sensitive and follow a \"Tumblr\" ethos. The author apologized after the incident and respects their friends personally, but now faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if they did apologize and respect others. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was under the influence when they made the comment about not believing in genderfluidity. They did apologize afterward and affirmed their respect. However, the friend's partner was upset and brought up the issue publicly. The author's belief that the friend might be \"histrionic\" and changing names could be seen as dismissive or invalidating of the friend's identity, even if the author isn't directly attacking them. The fact that the group is very sensitive and the author is now being mocked for not being an \"SJW\" might add context about the social dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being accused of being an asshole, but they claim they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. The problem is that discussing someone's identity in a group setting, even if it's their personal belief, can be harmful. The author might not realize that their skepticism about genderfluidity could be hurtful, even if they don't act on it. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the comment was taken as an attack, even if the author's intent was just to express a personal view.\n\nAlso, the author's belief that their friend is \"histrionic\" because of name changes and lack of physical changes could be a misinterpretation. Gender identity is personal and doesn't require visible changes. The author's judgment here might be based on misunderstanding or stigma around non-binary identities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, even if you disagree with it. The author's comment, while made in a private context and while stoned, might have been hurtful. Even if they apologized, the fact that they have been avoiding the group due to \"hostility\" and the friend's partner's public accusation could indicate that the author's actions caused tension. The key point is whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even with respect, is acceptable.\n\nI think the main issue here is that the author is not in the wrong for having their own beliefs, but they are in the wrong for expressing skepticism in a way that caused hurt and for not respecting the friend's identity publicly. However, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were intentionally harmful. Since they did apologize and respect the friend's rights, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. But given the context of the friend's partner's reaction and the author's dismissive attitude (\"histrionic\"), it's possible they are in the wrong for not affirming their friend's identity.\n"
