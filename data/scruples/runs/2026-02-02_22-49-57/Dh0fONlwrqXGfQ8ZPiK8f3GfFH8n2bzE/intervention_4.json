Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is someone who's usually left-leaning and supports equal rights. They don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then, while stoned, they made a comment doubting genderfluidity. The friend's partner then publicly called them out in a group message, and the partner later speculated the friend was just \"trying out being trans.\" The friend has been inconsistent with their name and gender expression, changing their name four times and sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has been avoiding the group because of their hostility, which they associate with Tumblr's over-sensitivity. The author apologized for the hurt feelings caused and clarified their respect for their friends' identities despite their personal beliefs. Now, they're being mocked as an \"anti-SJW\" type.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author made a comment under the influence, apologized, and still respects their friends. The friend's partner was confrontational, and the friend's behavior is inconsistent. The author is avoiding the group because of the hostility.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFrom what I understand, respecting people's identities is a big part of being supportive. Even if the author doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity, they've stated they don't oppose equal rights. The comment was made in a discussion context while stoned, and they apologized. However, the friend's partner took issue with the comment, leading to public shaming. The author's avoidance of the group because of the hostility could be seen as understandable if the group is overly sensitive or hostile, but it might also be seen as them withdrawing support. \n\nBut the author does say they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. The issue is the author's disbelief in genderfluidity and the resulting tension. In many communities, it's expected to respect someone's identity even if you don't personally agree. So, even if the author's comment was made in a discussion, openly doubting someone's gender identity might be seen as problematic, especially if it's a minority identity. The partner's public call-out might be a reaction to that. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and clarified their stance. The friend's inconsistent behavior might also be a factor in the situation. Maybe the friend isn't fully committed to the identity, which complicates things. But the author's main action is expressing disbelief, which could be seen as transphobic or invalidating, even if done in a discussion and under influence. \n\nIn terms of social media dynamics, the group's reaction (calling the author out and mocking them) might be part of a culture that's quick to label dissent as transphobic. But the author is in a sensitive position where their comment was hurtful, even if they later apologized. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's disbelief in genderfluidity and expressing it, even if in a context and with an apology, might be considered harmful because it undermines the friend's identity. The partner's reaction could be a valid response to that. The author's avoidance might be a result of feeling targeted, but the initial comment could still be seen as wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because acknowledging someone's identity is important, even if one doesn't believe in the concept personally. However, there's nuance with the author's intent and apology. But in many social circles, such a statement, even if later apologized for, might be seen as invalidating and thus the author could be at fault.\n"
