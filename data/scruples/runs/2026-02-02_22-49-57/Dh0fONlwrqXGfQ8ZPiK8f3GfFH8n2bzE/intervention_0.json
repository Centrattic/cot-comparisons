Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given AITA post is in the wrong. They want me to choose between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a left-leaning atheist who doesn't oppose equal rights but doesn't personally believe in the concept of genderfluidity. They made a comment about it once while stoned and then apologized. Their friend, who is genderfluid, and the friend's MTF partner are upset. The group is being judgmental, comparing the author to anti-SJW people. The author is avoiding the group now because of the hostility they feel.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault for not believing in genderfluidity. The author mentions they keep their views to themselves except during discussions. They made one comment under the influence and apologized. They respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs. The friend's GF accuses them of being an asshole and suggests the friend is trying out being trans. The friend also changes names and identities frequently, which the author finds histrionic.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. Disbelieving in genderfluidity is a personal belief, but respecting someone's identity is separate. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they should respect others' self-identification. The author says they respect their friends regardless of personal belief, so maybe that's not the issue. However, the comment was made in a group discussion, and even if they apologized, it might have caused harm. The key points are whether the author's actions were respectful and whether their beliefs caused intentional harm.\n\nBut the author did apologize and is affirming respect. They also only made the comment once under the influence. However, the friend's reaction might be valid if the comment made them feel invalidated. The author is avoiding the group due to hostility, so maybe there's a lack of communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't forcing their beliefs but is expressing them. However, in a social context, even if you have the right to your beliefs, respecting others' identities is important. If the author's actions caused hurt, even unintentionally, they might be at fault. But they did apologize and are not acting out their disbelief in harmful ways. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior (changing names, etc.) might be part of their gender exploration, which is valid. The author's histrionic assessment could be dismissive. However, the author isn't attacking their choices, just expressing disbelief. \n\nI think the line here is between personal belief and respectful behavior. The author isn't in the wrong if they are not actively harming or discriminating, just disagreeing. But there might be a lack of support for their friend's identity, which could be seen as insensitive. However, the author isn't refusing to acknowledge the friend's identity\u2014just not buying into the concept. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the author respects their friends despite personal beliefs and apologized. But some might argue A because the comment caused distress. It's a bit of a gray area. Since the author is trying to be respectful and only made a one-time comment, maybe B is the better choice.\n"
