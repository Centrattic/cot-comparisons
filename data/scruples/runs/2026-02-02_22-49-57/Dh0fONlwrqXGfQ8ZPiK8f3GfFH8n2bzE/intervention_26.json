Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the details first.\n\nThe author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights. They don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep their thoughts to themselves unless discussing. There's a friend who identifies as genderfluid, and the friend's GF (maybe significant other?) sent a message to the group specifically calling out the author, implying they might be an anti-SJW. The author was stoned during a discussion where they expressed not believing in genderfluidity. They apologized later and clarified they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. The author now avoids the group because they feel hostility, and the friends seem to follow a very sensitive, Tumblr-like approach. The author feels targeted in jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is in a minority group (left-leaning, atheist) and claims to support equal rights. They made a comment under the influence, apologized, and affirmed respect. However, they still hold a personal disbelief in the concept of genderfluidity. \n\nBut gender identity is a personal and deeply held belief. Even if someone doesn't agree, expressing that disagreement can be seen as harmful, especially if it's public or dismissive. The author's friend and their GF were hurt, leading to the group isolating the author. \n\nThe key points are: the author expressed disbelief, then apologized and affirmed support. However, the fact that they still don't believe in it, even if they respect the person, might be problematic. In many social contexts, respecting someone's identity is separate from personal belief. Dismissing someone's identity, even with good intentions, can be harmful. \n\nBut the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and keep their opinions private unless discussing. The issue here is whether the single comment under the influence, followed by an apology, is enough to be considered wrong. The friend's GF might have overreacted by singling out the author, but the author's comment could have still been hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to avoid the group because they feel hostile might not be the fault of the group, but if the group is reacting to the author's initial comment, maybe the author's actions led to the tension. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, even if you don't personally agree. Dismissing genderfluidity as not real can be seen as transphobic or invalidating. The author's stance, even if they apologize, might still be considered wrong because it undermines the friend's identity. \n\nSo, even if the author meant no harm, their comment could have caused harm. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in someone's identity, which is generally considered disrespectful, even if they later apologize. However, some might argue B (not wrong) because they apologized and support equal rights otherwise. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's personal disbelief is wrong. In most progressive circles, respecting someone's stated identity is key, regardless of personal belief. Therefore, the author's disbelief, even if kept private, combined with the comment under the influence, might still be in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
