Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even when they disagree. They were introduced to a group of friends where one is MTF (male to female) and another is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves except during discussions. \n\nAn incident happened where the author, while stoned, expressed their disbelief. The genderfluid friend's GF messaged the group, specifically mentioning the author and implying they were being an asshole. The GF also speculated the friend was \"trying out being trans.\" The author's friend is inconsistent with their name and identity, changing names four times and using different pronouns or birth names. \n\nThe author feels the friend is being histrionic and avoids the group due to hostility. They mention the group follows \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr.\" The author did apologize for hurting feelings but stands by their belief that they respect their friends regardless. They're now facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had a disagreement about genderfluidity, which they expressed once under the influence, apologized, and tried to respect others. However, the friend's GF took offense, leading to the group being hostile. The author withdrew, which they feel is justified due to the environment.\n\nFrom a standpoint of respecting others' identities, even if one disagrees, it's important to be supportive. The author's statement \"I don't believe in genderfluidity\" could be seen as invalidating someone's identity. However, they did apologize and stated respect. The group's reaction might be part of a broader issue, but the author's initial comment was direct. \n\nIn many communities, especially those valuing social justice, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be hurtful, regardless of the person's intentions. Even if it's a personal belief, public expression can harm relationships. The author did apologize, which shows they recognized the impact. However, the fact that they continued to distance themselves from the group due to hostility might not absolve them entirely. The situation is complex, but the initial statement likely caused hurt, which makes the author partly responsible. \n\nTherefore, considering the sensitivity around gender identities and the potential harm caused by the author's statement, even if it was in a private discussion and under the influence, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
