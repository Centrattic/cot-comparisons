Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author posted an AITA on Reddit, explaining their situation.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning, an atheist, and supports equal rights despite personal disagreements. They mention they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The issue arose when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief. The friend's girlfriend called them out, leading to tension. The friend has since changed names and identities multiple times, leading the author to think the friend is being histrionic and avoid the group due to their perceived over-sensitivity.\n\nThe key points here are the author's public expression of disbelief, the context (being under the influence), and the subsequent fallout. The author apologized and respects their friends regardless of personal beliefs. However, the friends reacted negatively, comparing the author to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect for identity, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's gender identity, respecting their self-identification is crucial. The author's issue isn't with supporting the friend's rights but with not believing in the concept. However, expressing disbelief, even while stoned, can be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. The author did apologize, which shows some accountability, but the core issue is whether their personal belief justifies the expressed doubt and subsequent avoidance.\n\nThe friends' reaction might be seen as protecting their loved one's identity, which is valid. The author's avoidance could be due to discomfort with the group's sensitivity, but that's not the friend's fault. The author's stance may not be malicious, but in social terms, respecting others' identities regardless of personal belief is important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not accepting their friend's identity, even if they don't personally agree.\n"
