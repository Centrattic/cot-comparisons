Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into a friend's genderfluid identity and the subsequent fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The author identifies as being left-leaning, atheist, and supportive of equal rights. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with something. The friend in question is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in that concept. However, they usually keep their opinions private unless discussing. \n\nThe conflict arose after the author was stoned and made a comment about not believing in genderfluidity. The friend's girlfriend called out the author in a group message, suggesting the author is an asshole. The friend is changing names and identities frequently, using male pronouns or their birth name. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to the hostility. The author apologized for the comment and respects their friends regardless of personal beliefs. They're now facing jokes being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. I need to determine if the author's actions and beliefs make them the asshole here.\n\nThe main issues are: the author's disbelief in genderfluidity, even though they claim to respect the person. The author made a comment under the influence, which led to conflict. The friend's identity might be genuine, but the author is questioning it. Even though the author apologized and respects the friend, the initial comment could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if someone's belief is genuine, expressing skepticism about another's identity can be hurtful, especially if it's part of their self-perception. The author's avoidance of the group might be a reaction to the hostility, but the original comment was the catalyst. The author's stance is personal, but when it affects others and causes harm, it might be considered problematic. \n\nAlso, the author's justification of being \"left-leaning\" and supporting equal rights could be in contrast to their personal belief in this case. Even if they don't believe in the concept, they're still respecting the person, but the act of not buying into the identity might still be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe key here is whether expressing a personal disbelief in a friend's identity is acceptable, even if it's kept private. The author did express it once, under the influence, and then apologized. The friend or their partner might feel that the comment was hurtful and invalidating. The author's actions (avoiding the group) could be seen as a self-protective measure, but the initial comment might have crossed a line.\n\nIn many discussions, the principle is to respect a person's identity, regardless of one's personal beliefs. So even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, respecting their friend's self-identification is expected. The act of stating disbelief, even once and under the influence, might be seen as contributing to a toxic environment, especially if the friend is struggling with their identity. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, do come off as dismissive and could be hurtful. The fact that the friend's partner called them out suggests that the comment was offensive. The author's avoidance might be a result of the group's over-sensitivity, but the initial comment is the root. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because their disbelief and expression of it, even if private, caused harm and invalidated their friend's identity. Even if their intentions were not to be hurtful, the impact of their words is what matters in such situations."
