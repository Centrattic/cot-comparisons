Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity and the subsequent fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as very left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights even when they disagree. They were introduced to friends where one is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps it to themselves. There was an incident where, while stoned, the author made a comment, and the friend's GF called them out in a group message. The friend has been inconsistent with their name and identity, changing names four times. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group because they feel hostility. The author apologized after the comment and respects their friends despite their beliefs. Now, the group is making jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is crucial. Even if the author doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity, respecting others' self-identified gender is generally expected. The author made a comment under the influence and then apologized, but the friend's partner took it as a problem. The author's avoidance of the group might be due to feeling unsupported, but they might have crossed a line by expressing doubt about someone's identity, which can be hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and only expressed their disbelief once, then apologized. The friend's behavior (changing names, inconsistent identity) might be part of their personal journey, but that doesn't mean the author is right to question it. The key here is whether the author's actions were harmful. Expressing disbelief, even if done once and under the influence, can be invalidating. The author's subsequent avoidance might be a result of feeling judged, but they should probably engage with the group and continue respecting their friend's identity despite their beliefs. \n\nSo, the author is not respecting the friend's identity, which is a personal belief but not the friend's reality. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't support their friend's identity, leading to conflict. But maybe the answer is A. Wait, but some might argue that the author is just expressing their opinion and apologizing. However, in terms of social expectations, respecting others' identities is non-negotiable, so the author is wrong. So answer A."
