Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and this causing some tension with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to a group of friends where one friend is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. There was a situation where the author was stoned and expressed their disbelief, leading to the friend's girlfriend (GF) sending a message to the group about being supportive, specifically mentioning the author. The GF also speculated that the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The author's friend changes names and identities frequently without altering appearance or habits. The author now avoids the group due to feeling hostility and mentions they've been mocked as part of anti-SJW rhetoric.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's disbelief in genderfluidity and the consequences of expressing that. The author apologized for hurting feelings and respects the friends' identities despite their views. They argue that their statement was in context and under the influence, and they're facing backlash from the group.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and respect for others' identities, even if someone personally disagrees, how they express that matters. The author did express their disbelief, which led to conflict. Even with an apology, the act of stating they don't believe in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. However, the author claims to respect the friends regardless of their personal beliefs. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many social contexts, respecting others' identities and expressing disagreement without causing harm is important. However, if the author's statements are seen as harmful or dismissive, they might be at fault. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility also suggests that the situation is strained, but the initial statement about not believing in genderfluidity might be the root cause. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author claims to respect the friends, their public disbelief in genderfluidity, even if under the influence, could be perceived as harmful. The fact that the friend's partner called out the author specifically and others made jokes about them being anti-SJW might indicate that the author's statement crossed a line. Respecting someone's identity doesn't require agreeing with it, but expressing disbelief in a public or group setting can be hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expressing that disbelief, even if they apologized.\n"
