Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends where one of their friends is genderfluid. They mention they don't believe in the concept but try to keep it to themselves unless discussing. A situation arose where they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, leading to the friend's girlfriend (GF) publicly calling them out and implying the friend might be trying out being trans. The author feels the friend is being histrionic, avoids the group due to hostility, and is being mocked for not being an SJW. They've apologized and respect their friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is not buying into genderfluidity. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The key points here are about respecting someone's identity versus personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with a gender identity, they're expected to respect it. The author did express their disbelief in a context they think was appropriate but were under the influence. However, the friend's GF took offense, leading to tension. The author apologized, which shows some level of accountability.\n\nBut the author's avoidance of the group because of the hostility might be their own reaction. The problem is that even if they don't believe in the concept, the friend identifies as genderfluid, so it's about respecting that identity. The author's public statement under the influence might have caused harm, but they did apologize. The main issue is whether their stance is wrong. In many modern contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered the standard, regardless of personal beliefs. The author could be seen as not respecting their friend's identity, even if they don't agree with it. The fact that their friend's identity is causing them to avoid the group might indicate that their personal beliefs are affecting their relationships negatively. However, the author claims they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs, so maybe the issue is the initial statement causing hurt feelings. The GF's reaction and the friend's name changes add to the situation. The author is in a left-leaning community where such beliefs are more accepted, so their stance might be seen as out of line, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's belief is their own, but the way they expressed it (even under the influence) and the subsequent actions (avoiding the group) might be seen as not supporting their friend's identity. The key is whether not believing in genderfluidity is a personal right or if it's considered harmful when expressed. In many social contexts, respecting someone's identity is expected, even if one doesn't agree. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not believing and for causing the friend distress, despite apologizing. The answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). But maybe B if the author is allowed to hold personal beliefs without being in the wrong. Hmm. It's tricky. The line is between personal belief vs. respecting others' identities. The author's actions caused harm, even if unintentionally. So, A.\n"
