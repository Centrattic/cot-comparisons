Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong, with options A or B. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and the consequences of that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights even if they disagree. They were introduced to friends, one of whom is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves except during discussions. There was an incident where they were stoned and said they don't believe in genderfluidity. The friend's girlfriend called them out, implying the friend might be pretending. The author now feels hostile towards the group because they perceive them as oversensitive and following Tumblr's ethos. They apologized but feel targeted as an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author expressed their disbelief in a situation where they were under the influence. Even though they said it in context, the friend's GF took issue with it. The author then distanced themselves, leading to accusations of being part of the \"anti-SJW\" group. The author claims they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is generally seen as crucial, even if one disagrees with the concept. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might lead to confusion, but the author's public statement under the influence could have hurt feelings. The GF's message to the group and the friend's speculation suggest that the author's comment was taken as dismissive or invalidating. \n\nEven if the author has apologized and affirmed respect, the act of publicly stating disbelief, even when stoned, might be seen as harmful. The friends might feel that their identity is being questioned or not taken seriously, leading to the author being ostracized. \n\nHowever, the author is in a position where they have a right to their beliefs, but expressing them in a way that's hurtful could be problematic. The line between holding a belief and respecting someone's identity is important. Since the author acknowledges the friend's identity for the purpose of the group but doesn't personally believe in it, there's a conflict between personal belief and social respect.\n\nIn many social contexts, especially among friends, respecting each other's identities is expected, even if one's personal views differ. The author's actions led to tension and being labeled as part of a negative group. The key issue is whether the author's expression of disbelief crossed into being disrespectful or harmful to their friend's identity, despite apologizing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their actions contributed to the conflict, even if they later apologized. The harm caused by not respecting the friend's identity in a group setting where sensitivity is high could be seen as the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Some might argue that the author did apologize and tried to respect the friend regardless. However, the initial public statement under the influence and the subsequent distancing might have caused lasting damage. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
