Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to some conflict with their friend's girlfriend. The friend is genderfluid, and the author thinks they might be histrionic. The friend's GF accused the author of being an asshole, and others have made jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, even though they stated they respect their friends regardless. The issue here is whether expressing a personal belief, even if it's controversial, is considered being in the wrong. The author apologized and affirmed their respect, which might mitigate some blame. However, the context is that they were under the influence when they made this statement, and it was brought up in a group chat. The friend's GF felt targeted, which could be valid if the author's comments were hurtful or dismissive.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting others' identities is usually a priority, especially when those identities are part of a marginalized group. Even if the author holds a differing belief, how they express it matters. The fact that the author has actively avoided the group due to feeling hostility suggests there's a conflict. But the author also claims they don't oppose equal rights, so maybe their intention was not to harm but to express a belief.\n\nThe question is whether the author's personal disbelief makes them in the wrong. If they didn't directly attack their friend's identity but just stated their own view, maybe not. However, if their actions (like avoiding the group) and the initial statement caused harm, that could be problematic. The friend's GF's reaction and the ensuing jokes from others might indicate the author's stance is causing issues in the relationship. \n\nBut the author did apologize and try to clarify their stance. It's a delicate balance between holding personal beliefs and respecting others' experiences. In many discussions around identity, the emphasis is on respect and acceptance. If the author is not actively harming but is honest about their beliefs, it's a gray area. However, in social contexts, especially when someone's identity is involved, the expectation is often to refrain from expressing disbelief, even if it's personal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be seen as in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a context that caused hurt, even if they later apologized. The key is the impact of their words. Even if they don't intend to be harmful, the effect on others matters. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). But if the community values free speech and personal beliefs, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a tough call. However, in most social justice contexts, the emphasis is on respecting others' identities regardless of personal beliefs, so the author's stance might be considered wrong.\n"
