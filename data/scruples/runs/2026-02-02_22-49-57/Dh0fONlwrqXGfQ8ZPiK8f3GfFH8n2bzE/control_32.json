Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into a friend's genderfluidity, which causes some tension. The author says they don't oppose equal rights but personally don't believe in the concept. They mentioned this once while stoned, got called out by the friend's girlfriend, and now feel hostility from the group. They're being mocked by others as part of anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Gender identity is a sensitive topic, and people often have strong opinions. The author claims they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs, which is important. But the key point here is whether expressing a personal disbelief in a gender identity concept is harmful or wrong.\n\nThe author did say they don't believe in genderfluidity, but they apologized and stated they respect others. However, even if they apologized, making a statement that dismisses someone's identity can still be hurtful. The friend in question is changing names and identities, which the author perceives as histrionic. The GF's reaction suggests that the author's comment was not just a personal belief but something that was directed at their partner, possibly making the friend feel invalidated.\n\nThe author is part of a group that's described as following Tumblr's over-sensitivity and coddling ethos. The author might feel that they're being unfairly targeted, but the issue is whether their initial statement was the problem. Even if they were under the influence, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating their experience.\n\nIn many social justice contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author is left-leaning and supports equal rights, not believing in a gender identity that someone claims can be seen as harmful because it undermines their identity. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities frequently might complicate things, but the core issue is the author's statement and how it affected the friend.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group and the subsequent mockery suggest that there's a conflict here. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main point is that expressing doubt about someone's gender identity, even if done in private and under the influence, can be hurtful and is often considered disrespectful. Therefore, the author's actions contributed to the conflict, making them at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their disbelief and the way they expressed it likely caused harm to the friend's feelings and contributed to the group's reaction against them.\n"
