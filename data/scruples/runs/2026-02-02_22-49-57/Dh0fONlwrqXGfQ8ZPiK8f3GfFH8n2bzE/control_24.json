Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The post is from a self-described left-leaning atheist who doesn't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain identities.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. They had a discussion when they were stoned, where they expressed disbelief, and the friend's partner called them out. The friend has changed names and isn't changing appearance or habits, leading the author to think they're being histrionic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author did express their disbelief in a context where it was inappropriate, maybe during a discussion while under the influence. They apologized and affirmed respect for their friend, which is important. However, the friend and their partner feel hurt, and the author is now being compared to \"anti-SJW\" types, which is causing conflict.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, even if someone doesn't believe in a certain identity, they are expected to respect others' self-identification. The author's public expression of disbelief, even if brief, might have caused harm. The fact that they were stoned could be a mitigating factor, but that's not an excuse for hurting someone's feelings. The author's avoidance of the group post the incident suggests discomfort, which is understandable if the group is hostile, but the initial act of expressing disbelief when it was uncalled for is problematic.\n\nThe wrong here isn't necessarily about the belief itself but the act of expressing that disbelief in a context where it was hurtful. The author might not be malicious, but their actions impacted the friend negatively. The partner's direct call-out indicates that the statement was harmful. So, while the author may not be a \"monster,\" they did do something wrong by not respecting the friend's identity publicly and causing distress. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
