Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the scenario. The author identifies as left-leaning and supports equal rights, but they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They mentioned their disbelief in a group chat while under the influence, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend is genderfluid, and the author thinks they might be acting histrionically. The author has since avoided the group, feeling hostility from them, and is now being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for expressing their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if they apologized later. The question is about respecting others' identities versus holding personal beliefs. \n\nLegally and ethically, it's important to respect people's self-identified gender, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's statement that they don't believe in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating their friend's identity. Even if the author apologized, the initial statement might have caused harm. The friend's GF's reaction and the group's response suggest that they felt the author was being disrespectful, which can create tension in relationships.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that they only made the comment once, in context, and under the influence. They also clarified they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. But the act of not believing in someone's gender identity can be hurtful, even if the person is trying to be respectful otherwise. \n\nThe author might argue they were just sharing their opinion, but when it comes to identity, expressing disbelief can be seen as dismissive or transphobic, even unintentionally. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line by not accepting their friend's identity. \n\nConsidering societal norms and the importance of respecting individual identities, the author's stance is problematic. They are in a position where they should support their friend's identity even if they disagree with the concept. The fact that their friend is changing names and identities might be part of their personal journey, and the author's skepticism could hinder acceptance. \n\nIn summary, even if the author's intentions were to keep an open mind, their public expression of disbelief in a sensitive topic like gender identity is likely to be seen as wrong because it disregards their friend's self-perception and can contribute to a hostile environment.\n"
