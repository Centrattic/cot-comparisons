A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nSo the situation is that the couple planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, thinking massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her and ended up canceling. She's going to proceed without him. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that she thought massages are therapeutic and just wanted to understand his logic. She even offered to switch masseuses. On the other hand, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse due to the perceived sexual nature of massages, which he's not okay with. \n\nIs it right to push for something the partner is uncomfortable with? The author's actions led to an argument, and the boyfriend decided to cancel. But she tried to engage in a discussion and offered a solution. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid for him. The author might not have considered his feelings enough when she made the booking. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. Even if she thought she was being reasonable, making a decision that affects both without considering his prior feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. But the author was trying to understand and even offered to change. The boyfriend's response was to cancel, which might be excessive. \n\nThe key points: Did the author overstep by scheduling without checking? Or was the boyfriend being too rigid? Since the author tried to switch, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe she should have checked his preference first. However, the boyfriend's issue with massages being sexual in the first place might complicate things. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she was trying to accommodate and understand. The main issue is the boyfriend's rigid stance and unwillingness to compromise. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
