A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post (AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She still went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author scheduled the massages with the intention of getting a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. She mentions that she chose based on availability (male and female masseuses were available), so she paired each with the opposite sex. The boyfriend then objects because he feels massages are sexual and refuses to have a male masseuse. The author argues that massages are therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning, but he dismisses her as irrational. She offers to switch, but he wants to cancel. She proceeds without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she made a decision based on available options, perhaps assuming it's neutral. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered a compromise. She didn't force him but wanted to understand. Her intention was to facilitate their shared activity. \n\nThe boyfriend's stance is that massages are sexual, which he might find uncomfortable. His reaction seems to be more about his personal boundaries. He's dismissing her arguments and not engaging constructively. He's also choosing to cancel rather than compromise further. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for booking the male masseuse? Well, she didn't know his feelings beforehand. Since she tried to accommodate by switching, her initial decision wasn't malicious. It's possible she didn't consider his perspective, but given that she tried to adjust, maybe not. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to discuss and his insistence that she's wrong might indicate he's not open to dialogue. The author's approach was to understand, not to impose. She's taking the initiative to go without him now, showing she respects his decision.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate and compromise. The author made an effort to understand and adjust. The boyfriend's rigid stance might be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She took steps to address his discomfort. The boyfriend's unwillingness to engage constructively is more problematic. Hence, the answer should be B (No).\n"
