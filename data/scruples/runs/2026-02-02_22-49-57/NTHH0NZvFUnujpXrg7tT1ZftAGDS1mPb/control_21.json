A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend then says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author disagrees, thinks they're therapeutic, and tries to discuss it. He gets upset, says she's arguing just to argue, and wants to cancel the massages. She goes without him. Now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author made a choice based on available options, probably trying to be fair or practical by matching genders. The boyfriend has a personal boundary about male masseurs, which he finds uncomfortable. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her efforts, called her irrational, and refused to switch. She offered to switch, but he still wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she scheduled him with a male masseuse, which he objects to. But she made that choice before knowing his feelings. Did she have a right to assume it's okay? Maybe not. But he didn't communicate his discomfort earlier. However, when she offered to switch, he refused. Then she went anyway. So she's respecting his choice once he expresses it. \n\nHis argument about massages being sexual seems a bit like a cop-out. But his discomfort is real. She tried to accommodate him but he wasn't willing. The fact that he called her irrational and refused to switch might indicate he's being stubborn. She's standing her ground but also respecting his decision in the end. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong. She made a decision without knowing his feelings, but once he expressed them, she tried to adapt. He didn't communicate his needs upfront, and his reaction seems extreme. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
