A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author, a woman, scheduled massages for her boyfriend (male) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't have a male masseuse. The author tries to discuss his reasoning but he dismisses her as irrational and suggests canceling his appointment. She ends up going anyway without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. She initially made a choice based on availability, perhaps assuming it's okay to split by gender. But when the boyfriend expresses discomfort, she offers to switch, showing she's open to compromise. However, he refuses and wants to cancel. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making the decision without checking first.\n\nBut she might have thought splitting by gender was a good idea, maybe to avoid awkwardness. However, not consulting him first could be an issue. But after he objects, she tries to understand and offers a solution. His reaction seems more extreme\u2014refusing to adjust and turning it into an argument. The author's intention was to accommodate, but he's being rigid.\n\nMassages themselves are therapeutic, so his assertion that they're inherently sexual might be a personal belief. The author is trying to debate the logic, which he perceives as arguing. However, she's trying to understand his perspective, which is reasonable. His refusal to adjust and insistence on canceling suggests he's inconsiderate of her effort to have the massages.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author made a choice, but after feedback, she tried to adjust. The boyfriend's unwillingness to compromise might be the bigger issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She made an initial decision but was willing to change it, while he's being inflexible and dismissive.\n"
