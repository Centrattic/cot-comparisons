  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

She and her boyfriend planned to get massages together, and she chose the male masseuse for him and female for herself. He's upset, saying massages are inherently sexual, while she thinks they're therapeutic. He's now refusing to go, and she's going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she did something wrong. She made a choice without considering his feelings, maybe? But she did offer to switch masseuses later. So she tried to accommodate him. He's the one who insists on his own discomfort and cancels. But why is he upset? Because he feels massages are sexual, which might be a personal belief. But is it her fault for not knowing that beforehand?\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. From the story, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to change. He accused her of making it up to argue. That seems like he's not being cooperative. She was trying to have a discussion to find a solution. Maybe she shouldn't have booked without checking his preference first, but she did offer to switch. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
