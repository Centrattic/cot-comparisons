A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages being sexual versus therapeutic. \n\nFirst, the author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, stating that massages are inherently sexual. The author argues they're therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. He gets defensive, says she's making it up to argue, and insists on canceling. She still goes without him.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she made a choice based on available options, maybe thinking it was fair (male and female masseuses). She tried to engage in a discussion, offered to switch, and even went ahead without him when he refused. Her actions seem reasonable; she's advocating for her view and respecting his boundaries once he's clear. She didn't force him, just wanted to understand and then proceeded without conflict once he backed out.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he has a valid discomfort with the situation, perhaps due to personal beliefs or cultural background. He might feel that the author is dismissing his feelings by debating the sexual nature of massages. His reaction\u2014calling her irrational and suggesting cancellation\u2014could stem from frustration, but his stance is his personal comfort zone.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. The author didn't push him into the massage; she made an initial choice but offered to change it. He declined, and she accepted that. There's no coercion. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate it if he's unwilling to compromise in a respectful way. She's also entitled to her opinion on the massage's purpose.\n\nPotential issues: Maybe the author didn't consider his feelings beforehand. But she did offer to switch, which shows she tried to address his concerns. He didn't handle the discussion well by being dismissive, but that doesn't make her wrong for trying to understand. \n\nIn relationships, differences in opinions are normal. The author's approach was to discuss and compromise, which is healthy. The boyfriend's reaction escalated the issue, but the initial choice wasn't malicious. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
