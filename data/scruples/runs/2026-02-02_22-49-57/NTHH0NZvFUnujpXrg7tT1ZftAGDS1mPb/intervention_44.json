A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that the author, a 21-year-old female, booked massages for both her boyfriend (also 21) and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. The boyfriend then refused to have a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and suggested canceling the massages. She goes anyway without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author didn't know her boyfriend had an issue with male masseuses, so she made a choice based on available options. When he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. But he refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nThe question is whether her initial choice was wrong. Since she didn't know his preference beforehand, it's a common oversight. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable to try to accommodate them once they're known. But she didn't intentionally cause discomfort. Her response was also reasonable\u2014offering to switch shows she's trying to meet his needs. His reaction seems more about his own discomfort and maybe defensiveness rather than her being wrong-headed.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual is a personal belief, but it's not a universal truth. The author's view that they are therapeutic is another valid perspective. He shouldn't have dismissed her reasoning as irrational just because they disagree. The fact that she continued to the appointment without him shows she's standing by her decision, which is okay if she's willing to accept the consequences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a choice without knowing his preference, tried to adjust, and faced pushback. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues than her being at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
