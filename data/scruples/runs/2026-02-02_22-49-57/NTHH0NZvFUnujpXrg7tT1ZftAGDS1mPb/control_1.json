A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refuses the male masseuse. The author believes massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning. She even offered to switch masseuses, but he insisted on canceling and staying home.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, personal comfort, and communication. The author didn't force him in any way; in fact, she gave him options. The boyfriend has the right to his own boundaries, but he's also responsible for communicating that clearly. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which shows she's trying to respect his feelings. However, the boyfriend's response was to withdraw rather than find a solution. \n\nIs the author at fault? She was making a plan for both of them, but maybe she should have checked with him first about his preferences regarding masseuse gender. However, she did offer to switch when he expressed discomfort. His reaction seems extreme, especially since she was flexible. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's just making a choice based on available options and then accommodating his request. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but his response might be overly rigid. The author's actions were reasonable\u2014she tried to understand, adjust, and still went ahead when he refused to compromise. Since she's not forcing him and offered alternatives, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively might be his own issue. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She handled the situation with flexibility and respect for his boundaries, even though he didn't reciprocate the same understanding.\n"
