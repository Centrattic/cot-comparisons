A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse and a female one for themselves. The boyfriend is upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and that the author is pushing his discomfort. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, and even went ahead without him. They think the author isn't wrong, but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author made a decision based on the available options, splitting the male and female masseuses between them. The boyfriend has a personal issue with male masseuses, considering massages as sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but the boyfriend dismissed their perspective as irrational and eventually refused to go at all.\n\nKey points: The author's intention was to book the available masseuses without considering the boyfriend's specific discomfort beforehand. The boyfriend's issue is about his personal boundaries regarding opposite-sex services. The author's response was to engage in discussion and offer solutions, but the boyfriend escalated it by canceling. \n\nNow, considering rights and responsibilities in a relationship. The author didn't know the boyfriend's preference and acted without malice. However, maybe they should have checked in first? But the boyfriend's stance is about something he's uncomfortable with. The author's approach was to seek understanding and compromise, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively and his dismissal of the author's viewpoint as \"making it up\" might be the real issue here. \n\nAlso, the author isn't forcing the boyfriend to proceed if he's uncomfortable. They're willing to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction of canceling seems more about being upset with the author's initial decision rather than a justified refusal. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted without intent to upset and tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's rigid stance and refusal to compromise might make him the asshole here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
