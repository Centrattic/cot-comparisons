A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 21-year-old female, scheduled her boyfriend (also 21, male) with a male masseuse, while she took the female one. When she told him, he was upset and said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thought they were purely therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasoning, but he called her irrational and ended up canceling his massage. She's still going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their perspectives. The author wanted to plan the massages together, maybe thinking it was a neutral choice or just splitting them by gender. But the boyfriend has a strong objection to a male masseuse, feeling it's sexualized. He's in a monogamous relationship, so he's probably uncomfortable with the idea of another man being close to him, even for a massage. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author might have thought it was a normal arrangement, but she didn't consider his feelings beforehand. Even if she had good intentions, not checking in with him first could be seen as dismissive of his comfort. The boyfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, is about his personal boundaries. \n\nShe tried to explain and understand his reasoning, offering to switch, but he still refused. He canceled his own appointments, so it's his decision, but he accused her of pushing for something he's uncomfortable with. The question is whether she was wrong in her initial choice. \n\nSince she made the booking without considering his specific preferences, even if they were about to discuss it, maybe she should have asked first. Massages can be personal and sensitive, especially if someone has issues with opposite-sex interactions. So, while she didn't have malicious intent, not checking in might have been a misstep. However, she tried to resolve it by offering alternatives. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction was to just cancel, which might be his own choice. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she tried to accommodate. But she could have been more considerate initially. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she made an effort to understand and adjust, but maybe A if not considering his feelings first is a problem. I'm a bit conflicted. However, in relationships, communication is key. If she had asked him first, maybe the issue could have been avoided. But since she went ahead and then tried to resolve it, perhaps she's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
