A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a woman, booked her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse, while she got the female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thought they were therapeutic and tried to discuss it, but he refused and even suggested canceling his massage. She went anyway without him. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic, so she scheduled based on the available options. She tried to understand his reasons and even offered to switch. On the other hand, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he sees massages as sexual. He's upset that she didn't consider his feelings, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, I should consider if the author overstepped. She made a decision without consulting him first. Even if she intended to discuss it, she didn't check in with him before booking. That could be a problem because personal boundaries are important. However, sometimes in relationships, people make plans together and split decisions. But in this case, she might have assumed his comfort level without confirming.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is about his perception of massages as sexual. While that's his feeling, it's important for the author to respect that. She tried to understand, but the fact that he's so adamant might mean she should have let him choose his own masseuse. However, she did offer to switch, which shows willingness to accommodate. But he refused to switch, preferring to cancel instead. \n\nIs the author wrong for not considering his feelings? Maybe. She could have asked his preference before booking. But she might have thought it was a straightforward split (male and female). However, his discomfort is valid, and she might have should have prioritized his comfort. But massages can be a personal choice. If he's not comfortable with a male masseuse, then it's his right to decline. But the author might feel that she's being forced to cancel her own plans. \n\nThe key points are about communication and respect for boundaries. The author didn't check with him first, which might be a mistake. But she tried to resolve it by offering to switch. The boyfriend's response was to cancel, which might be an overreaction. But his feelings are valid. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' feelings matter. The author might be in the wrong for not considering his immediate comfort, but the boyfriend's refusal to compromise could also be an issue. However, the main question is about the author's actions. She made a decision without his input, leading to his discomfort. So maybe she is partly in the wrong. But if she tried to adjust and he still refused, perhaps it's a shared issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she didn't check with him first, and even though she offered to switch, the initial decision to book without his input might be where she went wrong. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his feelings and preferences beforehand. But others might argue that the boyfriend was being unreasonable. However, in this case, the author's action was the initial problem, so the answer is A.\n"
