A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who scheduled a massage for her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and she herself has the female one. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse. He says massages are inherently sexual, which the author disagrees with, thinking they're therapeutic. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, but he called her views irrational and wanted to cancel. She offered to switch, but he said to cancel and she decided to go without him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author made a choice based on her understanding of the situation. She didn't know her boyfriend's preference beforehand. The boyfriend's discomfort is about the gender of the masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered a solution (switching), but he refused. The author then went ahead with her plans.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she thought she was being fair by splitting the genders. The boyfriend's issue is about the inherent sexuality of massages, which the author disputes. The author's intention was to make a plan, not to cause discomfort. She tried to resolve the issue but he was inflexible.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's stance is that massages are sexual, which might be his personal belief, but that's unusual. Since they are in a monogamous relationship, his argument about opposite-sex massages being acceptable in that context is a bit contradictory, as the author points out. The boyfriend might be projecting his own insecurities or discomfort onto the situation.\n\nThe author's actions were based on practicality and splitting the available options. She didn't force him to go, just scheduled him. When he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate, but he wouldn't budge. The boyfriend's response seems to be more about his own feelings rather than the author's actions being wrong.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's boundaries. The author could have asked beforehand, but she didn't know. She made a choice based on available info. The boyfriend's reaction is about his personal boundary, not the author's intent. However, the author could be seen as not respecting his boundary by not checking first. But the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's intention was neutral, trying to plan. The boyfriend's discomfort is his issue. The author tried to resolve it, but he's unwilling. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she acted in good faith and tried to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his accusations that she's arguing just to argue might show his own issues. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
