A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a couple planning to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, and the author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he became defensive and even suggested canceling his massages.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. She made a decision based on the available options, perhaps trying to match the masseuse's gender with each person. There's no indication she was trying to be insensitive. She even offered to switch, showing she was willing to accommodate his preferences. Her main goal seems to be understanding his perspective, which is a healthy approach in a relationship.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction. He's uncomfortable with a male masseuse and views massages as sexual. The author is trying to understand why he holds that belief, which is reasonable. However, he accuses her of making it up to argue and becomes dismissive. His suggestion to cancel the massages seems like an overreaction, especially since the author was open to changing the arrangement.\n\nIs the author wrong for not initially knowing his preference? Probably not. People have different boundaries, and unless the boyfriend had previously expressed discomfort with male masseuses, the author couldn't have known. The key here is communication. The author made an effort to adjust after learning his discomfort, which shows she's trying to respect his feelings. The boyfriend's response, on the other hand, is more about shutting down the conversation rather than finding a solution.\n\nThe author's approach of wanting to debate the logic is a bit tricky. In relationships, it's important to balance discussion with empathy. However, her intention was to understand, not to argue. The boyfriend's reaction of refusing to switch and wanting to cancel might be his way of asserting his boundary, but it's a bit extreme when an alternative was offered.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't in the wrong for making an initial decision without knowing his preference. The boyfriend is responsible for communicating his boundaries. However, the way he reacted could be seen as dismissive. The author's persistence in trying to resolve it is positive, but she might need to recognize when to let go of the 'debate' in favor of respecting his comfort level without forcing an argument.\n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for the initial scheduling. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but his handling of the situation (refusing to switch and escalating to cancellation) is problematic. The author's efforts to accommodate and understand are on the right track, so she's not at fault here. The answer should be B.\n"
