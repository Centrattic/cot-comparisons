A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages, and she assigned the male masseuse to him and the female to herself. He's uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was probably to split the genders to avoid any awkwardness or discomfort. That makes sense. But the boyfriend is saying he won't accept a male masseuse because he sees it as sexual. That's his personal boundary. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting personal boundaries versus the author's right to make a decision. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The boyfriend is uncomfortable, so is it the author's fault for making the initial choice?\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she didn't know his preference beforehand. She tried to accommodate by splitting genders, which seems reasonable. When he expressed discomfort, she offered to change it. The main issue here is that the boyfriend didn't communicate his preference earlier. The author made a decision based on available options, and it's his responsibility to state his boundaries. So the answer would be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
