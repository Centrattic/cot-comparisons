A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that she and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. He then objected, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author argues they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning, but he shuts down the conversation and wants to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions were wrong. The main issue here is about respecting boundaries and communication. The author made a choice based on the available options (male and female masseuses) and assigned them based on her own reasoning. But the boyfriend has a personal boundary he didn't mention beforehand. \n\nIs it wrong to not know his preference? Maybe. She might have assumed it was okay since they were getting massages together. But he had a strong objection. The key here is whether she overstepped by not checking his preference first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she had asked him beforehand which masseuse he preferred, she might have avoided this. However, she might not have known he had such a strong opinion. But once he expressed discomfort, she tried to understand, offered to switch, but he refused. \n\nHe's being rigid and not open to discussion. His argument that massages are inherently sexual might be his personal belief, but the author's stance is that they're therapeutic. He's dismissing her perspective as irrational, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is reasonable. She didn't force him to go through with the male masseuse after he objected. She even offered to switch. His reaction of wanting to cancel and calling her reasoning irrational might indicate his own issues rather than her wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made an assumption based on available options, tried to accommodate his preferences once he objected, and maintained her stance based on her beliefs. The boyfriend's inflexibility and unwillingness to engage constructively might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
