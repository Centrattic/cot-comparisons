A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple planning to get massages together. The author, a woman, books her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend objects, saying he won't allow a man to massage him because he believes massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to discuss his reasoning but he dismisses her arguments and suggests canceling his massage. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author's action was to book the massages based on available options, perhaps assuming it's a standard practice. She might think that choosing a male masseuse for her boyfriend is neutral, as massage therapy is about health and relaxation. Her intention seems to be to facilitate a shared activity, not to impose anything. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's objection is rooted in his belief that massages have a sexual connotation, which makes him uncomfortable with a male masseuse. His reasoning might stem from personal values, past experiences, or cultural norms. He feels that getting a massage from a male in a monogamous relationship could be inappropriate. He feels that the author is not respecting his boundaries when she doesn't switch the bookings despite his objections and even argues about it. He then suggests canceling, which shows he's not willing to proceed under those conditions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author initially made the decision without considering the boyfriend's possible discomfort. Even though she tried to explain and offer to switch, he felt it was an argument and refused to proceed. The boyfriend's right to set his boundaries is important. The author might have assumed that choosing a male masseuse was okay, but the boyfriend's discomfort makes it an issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for not considering his feelings initially? Maybe, because she made the decision without discussing it first. However, massages can be seen as non-sexual medical services, so her perspective isn't without merit. The boyfriend's reaction is about his personal boundaries, which should be respected. \n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, which is a good step, but the boyfriend's discomfort was significant that he preferred to cancel. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author might have overstepped by not checking with him before booking. However, it's also possible that the boyfriend is overreacting by dismissing her arguments and canceling entirely. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author didn't intend to make an argument but perhaps should have considered his preferences first. However, the boyfriend's insistence on canceling because of discomfort could also be seen as rigid. \n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Since she made a decision that the boyfriend found uncomfortable and then there was a disagreement, maybe she's partially at fault for not considering his feelings beforehand. However, the boyfriend's reaction of canceling might be his choice, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nAlternatively, since she offered to switch and he still didn't want to proceed, maybe he's the one who's being unreasonable. The author's actions were based on a different perspective, but she did attempt to resolve the issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she made a decision based on her understanding of massages as therapeutic and tried to accommodate his discomfort by offering to switch. The boyfriend's refusal to proceed seems to be his own choice, not necessarily her fault.\n"
