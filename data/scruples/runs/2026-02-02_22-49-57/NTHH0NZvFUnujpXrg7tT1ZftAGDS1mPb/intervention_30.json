A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: male and female masseuses. She booked her boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. Then, her boyfriend objects because he doesn't want a man to massage him, calling massages inherently sexual. She tries to discuss it, wants to understand his reasoning, but he gets defensive, says she's wrong, and even suggests canceling his massage. She still goes through with the plan without him.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did she overstep by choosing for him? The boyfriend expressed discomfort, but did she have a right to make the decision? They were going together, but maybe he expected to choose his own masseuse. She tried to switch, but he refused. \n\nI think the key here is respecting each other's boundaries. The boyfriend has a valid reason\u2014feeling uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author might have assumed that since they're together, they can share experiences, but maybe she should have asked his preference first. However, she did offer to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate. He then cancels, which could be seen as being too rigid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention wasn't malicious. She wanted to split the masseuses, which is common in couples' massages. But maybe she didn't consider his specific discomfort enough. However, she did attempt to resolve it. \n\nI think the boyfriend is overreacting a bit, but the author could have been more considerate. However, since she tried to adjust and he refused, maybe she's not in the wrong. So, I'm leaning towards B, but not entirely sure. Maybe she should have asked first. But since she made an effort after, maybe it's okay.\n"
