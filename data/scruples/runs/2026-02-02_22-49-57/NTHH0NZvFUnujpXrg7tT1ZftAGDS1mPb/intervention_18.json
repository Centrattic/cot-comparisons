A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. So the situation is that they both wanted massages together, and she chose a male for him and female for herself. He got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't let a man touch him. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he said to cancel and she's going anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author made a choice based on the available options and her own perspective that massages are therapeutic. Her boyfriend has a different view, considering it sexual, which makes him uncomfortable. She tried to have a discussion and offer a compromise, but he's not receptive. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue is about personal boundaries and differing perceptions. The author might not realize that her choice of masseuse based on gender could be a sensitive issue for her boyfriend. Even though she thinks massages are non-sexual, her boyfriend's experience or belief is different. By not respecting his boundary, even if she thinks it's irrational, she might be causing him discomfort.\n\nBut she did offer to switch masseuses, which shows she tried to accommodate. However, he didn't accept that and instead wanted to cancel. Maybe she should have considered his feelings more before making the booking, but she was trying to be fair by matching genders. It's a bit tricky. On one hand, she had the right to make a choice, but on the other, she could have checked in with him first to avoid this conflict. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be about his own insecurities or past experiences. The author's approach was to debate and understand, which is reasonable, but he might have felt pressured. The author is now going alone, which is her right, but the main question is if she was in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she made a choice but tried to resolve it by offering a switch. However, she could have been more considerate of his preferences beforehand. But since she attempted to address his discomfort and he was unwilling to compromise, the fault isn't entirely hers. The key point is that she was trying to understand and adapt, even though the situation didn't resolve well. So the answer is B.\n"
