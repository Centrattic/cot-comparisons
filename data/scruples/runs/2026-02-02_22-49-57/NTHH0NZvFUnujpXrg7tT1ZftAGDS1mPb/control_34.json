A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: They both planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend objected because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and that he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a decision without consulting the boyfriend first. Even though she might have thought it was logical (since they were both getting massages and the opposite sex masseuse was available), she didn't consider his preferences. The boyfriend expressed discomfort, which the author tried to address by offering a switch, but he was firm. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, she made a choice that she thought was fair, but she didn't communicate with him first. On the other hand, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, especially since he's not comfortable with male masseuses. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered solutions, but he took it as an argument. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she scheduled without his input. That could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. But she did try to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction is also a bit harsh, dismissing her attempts to understand. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should have checked with him first, especially since it's a personal preference. But the boyfriend's stance is rigid. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps she could have handled it differently. However, since she made the decision without his input, even if it was well-intentioned, it's a point against her. \n\nBut the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and she should have considered it. However, she did offer to switch, showing she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's refusal led to the conflict. \n\nIn many relationships, respecting each other's preferences is key. The author might be in the wrong for not checking first, but the boyfriend's response is also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because while she could have communicated better, the boyfriend's stance and refusal to compromise also play a role. The author's intention was to have a shared experience and tried to adjust, so she's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
