A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend was fine with getting a massage but uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thought they're therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author made a choice based on her understanding of massage therapy being professional and non-sexual. She even offered to switch masseuses when the boyfriend expressed discomfort. He refused, suggesting canceling instead. The author went ahead without him. \n\nIs the author wrong for not accommodating his preference? Well, she did offer to switch, but he refused. Maybe she overstepped by not respecting his boundaries? Wait, but she tried to switch, and he said it's too much trouble. So maybe she tried her best but he was inflexible. \n\nOn the other hand, respecting personal boundaries is important. If he's uncomfortable with male masseuses, maybe she should have honored that without forcing a discussion. However, she was trying to understand his reasoning and even offered alternatives. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual is problematic. If he's okay with a female masseuse in a monogamous relationship but not a male, that might imply some double standard. The author's push for discussion could be seen as valid, especially if she's trying to challenge his assumptions. \n\nBut maybe she shouldn't have scheduled him with a male masseuse without discussing it first. However, the post says they were planning to get massages together, and the author chose the masseuses. Maybe she thought it was a simple booking. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling might be his issue. The author's intent was to understand and accommodate as much as possible. So the answer likely leans towards her not being at fault.\n"
