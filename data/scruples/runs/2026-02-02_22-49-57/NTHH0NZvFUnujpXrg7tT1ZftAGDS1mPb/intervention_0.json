A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is they both planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked herself with a female masseuse and her boyfriend, a male, with a male one. But he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. She's going to go without him. The user thinks she's not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made a decision based on the available options. Maybe she assumed that same-gender masseuses would be more comfortable for each of them. But the boyfriend has a different view, believing massages are sexual, so he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The problem arises when she insists on the discussion and tries to debate his stance, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong here? Well, she made a choice that turned out to be uncomfortable for her partner. She tried to understand his reasoning, which is a positive step. But maybe she didn't consider his comfort level enough before making the booking. However, she did offer to switch, showing willingness to accommodate. He dismissed her explanation and refused to budge, which is his own stance. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author initiated the discussion to understand, but the boyfriend's response was rigid. However, the author might have assumed her approach was neutral or even beneficial. But the issue is whether her initial decision was wrong. \n\nMassages can be seen as therapeutic, but if someone finds same-sex masseuses uncomfortable, that's their personal boundary. The author might not be in the wrong because she wasn't aware of his specific discomfort beforehand. She tried to adjust, but he refused to compromise. So perhaps the blame isn't entirely hers. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have checked with him before booking, especially since they were planning together. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she made an effort to explain and adjust, and the boyfriend's stance is rigid, the responsibility isn't solely hers. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She made an effort to understand and adjust, and the boyfriend's refusal to switch is his own issue. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
