A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: male and female masseurs. She chose the male one for her boyfriend and the female for herself. When she told him, he was uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and said to cancel his appointment. She still went without him.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author's intention was to book based on availability and maybe gender balance. She tried to understand his perspective and offered alternatives. On the other hand, the boyfriend felt his comfort was being disregarded. He might feel that the author didn't consider his boundaries, even if she tried to explain her reasoning.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't know his discomfort beforehand. She made a choice based on available options. Her trying to understand and offering to switch shows she's trying to be accommodating. The boyfriend's refusal and cancellation might be his way of asserting his boundaries, but the author isn't forcing him to go against his comfort. She respects his decision in the end by going without him. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's an alternative view. Did she have a right to assume the male masseuse was okay? Since she didn't know his feelings before booking, it's a common oversight. She did offer solutions, so her actions were reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
