  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it, claiming massages are inherently sexual. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and said to cancel his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought it was a neutral decision, choosing based on availability and splitting genders. But her boyfriend felt uncomfortable because he believes massages have a sexual connotation. She wanted to discuss his perspective, which he took as argumentative. \n\nI should think about boundaries and communication. The author tried to be accommodating by offering to switch, which shows she's trying to respect his feelings. However, he didn't engage in the discussion and instead just wanted to cancel. That might indicate he's not open to compromise. \n\nIs it the author's fault for making a choice that he disliked? Maybe not, since she didn't know his feelings beforehand. But she did try to adjust, so she's showing consideration. On the flip side, the boyfriend could have communicated his discomfort earlier. \n\nAlso, the debate about whether massages are sexual vs. therapeutic is subjective. The author's stance isn't irrational; many people see massages as purely therapeutic. The boyfriend's refusal to engage in the discussion and his ultimatum might make him seem inflexible. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a decision based on equal distribution, tried to resolve the issue, and the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort than her action being inherently wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
