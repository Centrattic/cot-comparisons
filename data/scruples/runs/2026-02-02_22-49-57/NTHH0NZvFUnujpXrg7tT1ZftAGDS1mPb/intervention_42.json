A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and he doesn't want a man to massage him. The author tried to discuss it and even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about consent and comfort. The author made a decision based on the available options, thinking it was fair to split by gender. But the boyfriend has a strong objection. The question is whether the author overstepped by not considering his feelings beforehand.\n\nWait, the author didn't ask him first. She assumed he'd be okay with a male masseuse. But maybe she should have checked with him before booking. However, the boyfriend's reasoning seems a bit inconsistent. He says massages are inherently sexual, so why is he okay with a female masseuse? That's a bit confusing. The author is trying to understand his logic, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the boyfriend is upset and wants to cancel. The author offered to switch, but he refused. So the author is going ahead without him. Is that wrong? Well, she's not forcing him. She tried to accommodate, he didn't want to. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Her intention was to split the masseuses based on availability, not to make him uncomfortable. The real issue might be that the boyfriend's belief that massages are sexual is problematic, but that's his personal view. The author isn't wrong for not sharing that view and trying to understand. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
