A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend later objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, and refuses to switch. The author wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a couple planning massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend's objection is based on his belief that massages are sexual, which he might find uncomfortable. The key points here are consent and personal boundaries.\n\nThe author's action was based on the available options and perhaps a neutral approach, not considering the boyfriend's specific discomfort. However, when he expressed his discomfort, she tried to engage in a discussion. He dismissed her efforts and refused to switch, even canceling the appointment. \n\nNow, whether she's at fault depends on whether she violated his boundaries. She scheduled the massage without considering his feelings, which might be an oversight. But once he voiced his discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. He refused, which complicates things. The author's intention wasn't malicious, but maybe she should have checked in with him before booking. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since he's the one who didn't communicate his preference beforehand. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties share some. The author didn't consider his potential discomfort, but the boyfriend also didn't express his feelings about massages being sexual earlier. The main question is whether scheduling the male masseuse was wrong. Since she tried to resolve the issue and he refused any compromise, the fault isn't entirely on her. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
