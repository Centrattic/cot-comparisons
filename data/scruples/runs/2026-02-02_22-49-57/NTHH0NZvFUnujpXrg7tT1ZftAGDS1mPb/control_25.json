A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and she chose different genders for each, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted to understand her boyfriend's reasoning about massages being sexual. She tried to discuss it, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. Now, the question is whether she's at fault.\n\nThe boyfriend's stance is that massages are inherently sexual. He's uncomfortable with a male masseuse because of that, and he feels the author is pushing him into something he's not comfortable with. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to rationalize his position.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's trying to understand his logic, engage in a debate, and even offered to switch. She's not forcing him to stay with the male masseuse but tried to accommodate. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is being rigid and dismissive, calling her opinion irrational and refusing to compromise beyond canceling.\n\nThe main issue here is about respecting each other's boundaries and communication. The author is advocating for her choice while being open to his feelings, whereas the boyfriend is not being receptive to her perspective and is taking a confrontational stance. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to listen and find a middle ground. The author tried to find a solution, but the boyfriend's response was to cancel rather than negotiate. His reaction seems more about his discomfort and unwillingness to discuss further rather than her actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to understand and adjust. The boyfriend's rigidity is causing the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
