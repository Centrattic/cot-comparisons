A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset and says massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic. He's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, and she tried to understand and switch, but he didn't want to and just wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might have thought it's just about getting a massage, and she might not see the issue. She even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate him. But the boyfriend feels that the massage is sexual, so a male masseus makes him uncomfortable. Maybe there's some cultural or personal belief here. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not knowing beforehand? She probably didn't realize he had such a strong preference. She tried to explain her reasoning, and he dismissed it, even calling her irrational. That seems harsh. He could have communicated his discomfort earlier when they were planning. But he didn't, and now he's upset. She's trying to understand, which is a reasonable approach. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is making her feel like she's wrong, but she's just trying to be accommodating. His refusal to switch and wanting to cancel might be his choice, but the author is standing her ground. She's not forcing him to go; she's offering alternatives. \n\nI think the key points are that the author didn't know about his discomfort beforehand, tried to resolve it by switching, and he's being rigid. She's not in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
