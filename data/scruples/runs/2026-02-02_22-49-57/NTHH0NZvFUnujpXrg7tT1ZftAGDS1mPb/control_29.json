A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse, and the boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it and offered to switch, but the boyfriend refused and wanted to cancel. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he finds opposite-sex massages sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he still refused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made a decision without considering his discomfort, even if she thought it was neutral. But she did offer to change it. Maybe she should have asked his preference first. On the other hand, he's being rigid and not compromising. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, but she might have assumed his comfort level without checking. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have made a mistake by not asking his preference before booking. But she did try to resolve it. The boyfriend's stance seems a bit extreme, but his discomfort is real. So, maybe the author is slightly at fault for not checking in first, but not entirely. However, the options are only A or B. Since the author tried to accommodate, but the boyfriend was inflexible, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't consider the boyfriend's perspective before making the booking. Even if she intended to discuss it, the initial decision was hers. So she's partially responsible. But the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made a choice that caused discomfort, even if she tried to fix it, the answer might be A (Yes). But some might argue B (No) because she made an effort to resolve it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because the boyfriend's reaction is unreasonable, and the author's intent was good. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's objection is about the sexual nature of massages. The author tried to reason, offered to switch, but he refused. The author's actions were based on her own belief but didn't consider his feelings. However, in the end, she's willing to go without him. So maybe the answer is B (No), because she made an effort to address the issue. The boyfriend's reaction is more extreme. The initial decision might not be entirely her fault, but she tried to adjust. So maybe the answer is B. But some might say she should have asked first. It's a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the key is that she didn't consider his feelings before booking. Even if she thought it was neutral, she should have checked. So A (Yes). But others might say the boyfriend is overreacting. But the question is about the author's fault. Since she made a choice that caused him discomfort, even if she tried to fix it, she's at fault. So answer A.\n"
