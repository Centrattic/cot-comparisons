A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about whether massages are inherently sexual. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, says massages are sexual, and refuses to switch. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author made a choice based on the available options (male and female masseuses) and assigned them accordingly. The boyfriend's issue is about the sexualization of massages, which he finds problematic. The author thinks massages are therapeutic, hence the initial booking. The boyfriend feels his discomfort is valid and that the author is being argumentative instead of respecting his boundaries. \n\nNow, considering consent and personal boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, his feelings are valid. The author tried to discuss and even offered to switch, but he refused. However, the author still went ahead without him. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author didn't force the boyfriend to have a male masseuse; they offered to switch. The boyfriend, however, insisted on canceling rather than switching. The author's intention was to facilitate the activity, but the boyfriend's refusal is about his own comfort. The author is within their right to proceed with their own choice if the boyfriend cancels. But maybe the author should have considered the boyfriend's feelings more, but they did try to accommodate. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal might be seen as being inflexible. However, in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author tried to reason and compromise. The boyfriend, after being offered a switch, still didn't go, so the author isn't at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they made a reasonable choice and attempted to accommodate the boyfriend's concerns. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling is his own decision, and the author isn't wrong for trying to maintain the plan while respecting his partner's discomfort as much as possible.\n"
