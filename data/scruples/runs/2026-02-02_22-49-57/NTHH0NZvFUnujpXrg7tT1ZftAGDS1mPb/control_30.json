A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They both had planned to get massages together. The woman chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying he doesn't want a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The woman thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He gets defensive, says she's being irrational, and eventually wants to cancel his massage. She goes anyway without him.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author at fault here?\n\nFirst, the woman's action was to book the same-sex masseuse for her partner. Maybe she thought it was fair or practical. But the boyfriend has a strong aversion. He feels massages are sexual, which is a personal belief. The woman is trying to understand his perspective, which is good communication. But he's not open to discussion and is getting defensive. \n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and comfort. The woman scheduled it without considering his clear discomfort. Even though they had planned to get massages together, she made a decision that affects his comfort. He didn't agree, and she might have assumed it was okay without checking. However, she did offer to switch masseuses after he objected. He refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nIs the woman wrong for making that initial decision? It depends on how much input she had from him. If he had mentioned before that he doesn't want a male masseuse, then she's at fault. But in this case, he didn't mention it until after she scheduled it. So maybe she didn't know. However, when choosing shared activities, especially involving personal comfort, it's usually good to check in with the partner. \n\nHe might have a valid discomfort, and she could have asked beforehand. But she tried to resolve it by offering to switch. He refused, so now he's choosing not to go. The woman is going without him. \n\nThe main issue is whether the woman overstepped by making the decision without considering his possible discomfort. But if he didn't communicate it before, maybe she isn't wrong. However, in relationships, anticipating each other's comfort is important. She might have assumed it was fine without checking. \n\nOn the flip side, he could be overreacting by making it about being sexual. The woman trying to understand his reasoning is reasonable, but he's not being open-minded. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a decision based on available options, and he didn't communicate his preference. She tried to accommodate after he objected. The boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
