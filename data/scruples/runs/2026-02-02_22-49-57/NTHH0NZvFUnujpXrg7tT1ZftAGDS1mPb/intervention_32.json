A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling massages for both the author and her boyfriend, where she assigned a male masseuse to him and a female to herself. The boyfriend then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go with a male masseuse. He argues that the author is wrong for pushing the issue, and she keeps trying to understand his reasoning, even offering to switch. He ends up not attending, and she goes anyway. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a decision based on the available options (male and female masseuses), probably assuming it's okay to split them. The boyfriend has a different view, seeing massages as sexual. She tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to be accommodating. However, he insists on canceling, and she proceeds without him.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she didn't force him; she made a choice that he later objected to but she addressed it by offering a solution. He's the one who decided not to attend despite her efforts. She's acting in good faith, trying to understand his perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort rather than her being inconsiderate. She didn't push the issue beyond his refusal. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
