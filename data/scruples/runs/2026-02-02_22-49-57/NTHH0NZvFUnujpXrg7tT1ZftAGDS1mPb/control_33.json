  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She booked her own massage with a female one, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. He refuses to go with the male masseuse, says she's being irrational, and even wants to cancel. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he's still resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably thought she's being fair by alternating genders. Maybe she wanted to avoid any potential awkwardness by matching the masseuse's gender with theirs. But the boyfriend has a different view, seeing massages as sexual. His discomfort is valid if he's not okay with another man doing it. The author tried to reason and offer solutions, but he's not budging.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for booking him with a male masseuse? Well, she didn't know his boundaries beforehand. She might not have considered his feelings about the gender of the masseuse. But she did try to accommodate by offering to switch. However, he's refusing and even wants to cancel. The key here is whether the author should have known his feelings in advance. Since massages can be personal, maybe she should have asked first. But she did make an effort to adjust after he expressed his discomfort. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. The boyfriend's refusal might be more about his own preferences, but the author acted in good faith. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
