A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe couple planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then objected because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and that he's uncomfortable with a man. The author tried to understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting boundaries and differing comfort levels. The boyfriend clearly stated his discomfort with male masseuses, possibly due to his perception of massages as sexual. The author, on the other hand, sees massages as purely therapeutic. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was wrong in her decision. The boyfriend's discomfort is a personal boundary. Even if the author disagrees with his reasoning, he's not obligated to comply with something that makes him uncomfortable. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, but he refused. It seems like she respected his choice by proceeding without him.\n\nBut wait, did the author have the right to make the booking without considering his preferences? She might not have known about his discomfort beforehand. However, once he expressed it, she tried to address it. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme by suggesting cancellation, which could be seen as overreacting. However, the author isn't wrong for trying to understand his perspective and respecting his boundaries after he expressed them.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she didn't force him into something. She listened and tried to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch might be his own issue. The author's actions were reasonable, and she's not in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
