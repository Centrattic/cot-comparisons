A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling massages for the author and her boyfriend. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. He's upset because he says massages are inherently sexual, and he won't let a man massage him. She tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted to book based on the available options, maybe assuming it's about gender neutrality or something else. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, which he attributes to massages being sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to engage in a discussion. He feels she's being argumentative, and she's frustrated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she made a choice that he was uncomfortable with. Even if her intent was good, she didn't consider his feelings first. But she did offer to switch, showing she tried to accommodate. However, he refused to switch and wanted to cancel, which might be his overreaction. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the boyfriend clearly has a strong aversion to male masseusers, the author should have asked his preference before booking. She didn't do that, so maybe she's in the wrong for not checking first. On the other hand, he could have communicated his discomfort earlier. But the fact remains she made the decision without considering his feelings. \n\nThe author's defense is that she wanted to understand his logic. However, the initial action was the problem. She might have had good intentions, but acting without consulting him first could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. So, the answer might lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong) for not checking his preference first, even if she tried to resolve it afterward.\n"
