A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two masseuses available: one male, one female. She booked him with the male and herself with the female. He gets upset because he says massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseuse. She thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He refuses to switch and cancels his appointment, leading her to go alone. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication. The boyfriend clearly states he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning but he gets defensive and labels her as irrational. She offers to switch, he still refuses. \n\nSo, when someone expresses discomfort or a personal boundary, especially around something as sensitive as body contact with someone of the opposite sex, it's important to respect that. Even if the author's intention was to split the masseuse genders, her boyfriend's discomfort is valid. The fact that he's in a monogamous relationship doesn't negate his personal feelings about the massage context. \n\nShe tried to engage in discussion, which is good, but he was unwilling to compromise beyond canceling. The author's actions, while not malicious, disregarded his comfort level. Even if she offered to switch, the initial booking might have been an oversight in considering his preferences. So, it seems like the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect his boundary, despite her good intentions.\n"
