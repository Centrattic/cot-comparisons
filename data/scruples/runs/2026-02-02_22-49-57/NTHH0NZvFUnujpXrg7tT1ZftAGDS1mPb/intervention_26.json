A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they planned to get massages together, and she booked him with a male masseuse while she has the female one. He's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She argues they're therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning, but he's not open to discussion and wants to cancel his massages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's choice was based on the available options, but the boyfriend felt uncomfortable. The key points here are autonomy, comfort levels, and communication. The author tried to explain her reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his feelings. However, he's not willing to engage in a discussion and instead wants to cancel the appointment, which could be about his own discomfort rather than her being wrong.\n\nMassages can be personal, and people have different boundaries. The author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's suggesting a service. His reaction seems to stem from personal beliefs about sexuality in massages. She's trying to understand his logic, which is a reasonable approach. The fact that she offered to switch shows she's respectful of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not engaging in a constructive discussion and is dismissing her efforts, which might indicate his own issues rather than her being wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice based on available options, especially since she attempted to resolve the conflict. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author's actions don't inherently wrong him. She's respecting his autonomy by offering to change the booking, so there's no fault on her part. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
