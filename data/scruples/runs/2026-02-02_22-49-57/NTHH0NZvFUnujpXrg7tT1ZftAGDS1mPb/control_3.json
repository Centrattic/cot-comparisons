A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend even though he's uncomfortable with it. She's a 21-year-old female, and her boyfriend is also 21 and male. They planned to get massages together. She chose a male for him and a female for herself. He then objects, saying that massages are inherently sexual, and he won't go with a man. She thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he gets defensive, says she's being irrational, and even suggests canceling his appointment. She ends up going without him.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation. First, she made a choice without consulting him. Even though they were going together, she decided the masseuse's gender. That might be the issue. But the key points here are consent and discomfort. She might have thought it was a minor detail, but he has strong feelings about it.\n\nHe says massages are inherently sexual. That seems like a personal belief, and it's his choice to be uncomfortable. She tried to discuss it, which is good, but he reacted negatively. Maybe she should have asked his preference before booking. However, she did offer to switch, so she was trying to accommodate him. He refused and even said to cancel, which is a strong response.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, if she had checked with him first, maybe the issue wouldn't have arisen. But she didn't. However, her intentions were to make it a fair split (male and female), which isn't inherently wrong. The problem is that his comfort was compromised. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. So by not checking first, she might have overstepped, but the situation isn't entirely her fault because he also took it too far by refusing to switch and canceling. \n\nBut the main question is if she's in the wrong. She made a choice that affected him, and he was uncomfortable. Even though she tried to explain and offer a solution, the initial decision to book without consulting him is where the issue lies. So she might be partially at fault for not considering his feelings first. But he also overreacted. However, the answer options are A or B, not a middle ground. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and she did act without his input, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that it's not her fault because it's a personal choice. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B because he's being unreasonable. But in relationships, communication is key. Even if his belief is irrational, she should have discussed it first. So the fact that she scheduled without asking might make her at fault. But then again, maybe not. It's a grey area. The key is that she tried to resolve it, but he was inflexible. But the initial action is the main point. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the decision wasn't malicious, and he's being overly rigid. Or maybe A. Hmm.\n"
