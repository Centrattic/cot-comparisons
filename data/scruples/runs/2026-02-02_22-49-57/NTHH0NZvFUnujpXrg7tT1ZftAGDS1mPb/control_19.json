A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the scenario is that the author (a woman) scheduled her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse, while she got a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a man massaging him, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. He gets defensive, says she's arguing just to argue, and wants to cancel the massages. She's going to go anyway without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong for scheduling him with a male masseuse. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The boyfriend made it clear he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author says she wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. But he still refused, asking to cancel instead.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author tried to be considerate by booking opposite-sex masseuses, but the boyfriend isn't comfortable. She made an effort to accommodate by offering to switch, but he still wanted to cancel. The author's intention was to understand, not to push an argument. She also says she's willing to go without him, which shows she's respecting his decision after he's made it clear.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort with the situation being perceived as sexual, which is his personal belief. The author isn't forcing him to go against his values; she's allowing him to back out. Since he's an adult and can make his own decisions, the author isn't in the wrong for making an initial choice and then respecting his refusal when he states it. She tried to resolve it amicably, so she's not at fault here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
