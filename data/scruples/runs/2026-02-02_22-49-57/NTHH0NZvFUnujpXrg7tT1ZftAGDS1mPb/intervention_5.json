A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he gets upset, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author argues they are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning but he refuses to switch and even suggests canceling his massage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which might be a common practice to avoid awkwardness. She tried to understand his perspective and even offered to switch. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, seeing massages as sexual. He dismisses her arguments, calls her irrational, and wants to cancel. \n\nIs the author wrong? She made a choice she thought was fair, based on gender. Maybe she should have checked with him first, but she did mention trying to understand his reasoning. He, however, is not being open to discussion and is making it about her being wrong. The key points are whether her action was respectful and if she overstepped. She tried to resolve it amicably. He's the one getting defensive and refusing to compromise. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
