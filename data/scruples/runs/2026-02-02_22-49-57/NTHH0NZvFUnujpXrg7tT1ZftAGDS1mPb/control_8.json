A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is about a couple booking massages together, with the author assigning the male masseuse to her boyfriend and the female to herself. The boyfriend objects to a male masseuse, claiming massages are inherently sexual, while the author argues they're therapeutic. The boyfriend refuses to switch, says the author is being irrational, and wants to cancel his massage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend. Even though they were going together, it's possible she assumed they'd be paired with opposite-sex masseuses, but it's better to check with the partner, especially when it involves personal comfort. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid; some people might feel that a male masseuse could make them uncomfortable, especially if they perceive massages as having a sexual connotation. The author's argument is about therapeutic vs. sexual, but it's not irrational to have differing views. However, the key point is whether she overstepped by scheduling without considering his feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be that he's uncomfortable and wants to cancel, which is his right. The author tried to switch, but he refused. Now, the question is if the author is wrong for not considering his feelings first. Even if she had good intentions, not checking in with him before booking could be seen as dismissive. The boyfriend's feelings are legitimate here. So while the author might not be entirely wrong, there's a responsibility to consider a partner's comfort in shared activities. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault for not discussing the choice beforehand.\n"
