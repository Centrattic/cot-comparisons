A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author, a woman, chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The boyfriend refuses to go with a male masseuse and even suggests canceling the appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's feelings. He's uncomfortable with the idea of a male masseuse, possibly due to personal beliefs or past experiences. His reasoning is that massages have a sexual element, which makes him uneasy. But the author thinks massages are therapeutic, not sexual. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch masseuses. However, he refused and wanted to cancel. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, but she ended up respecting his boundaries after he expressed discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own beliefs than the author's actions. She didn't force him to go with the male masseuse; she offered to change it. But he still refused. The author's actions don't seem malicious. She was trying to facilitate a couple's activity but adjusted when he was uncomfortable. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual might be a personal opinion, not a universal truth. The author's push to discuss it could be seen as trying to find a compromise, not being argumentative as he accused her. However, he didn't want to engage further, leading to the breakdown. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't wrong for trying to plan the activity. She did consider his feelings once he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust further (even after she offered to switch) might be his own issue. The author isn't at fault for his reaction. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
