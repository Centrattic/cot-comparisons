A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. He gets upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He accuses her of making it up to argue and says she's wrong. She offers to switch, but he says cancel it. She goes anyway without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't know he had an issue with male masseuses. She made a choice based on availability, maybe assuming it's okay. But he has a personal boundary here. The problem is that she scheduled him without considering his possible discomfort. Even if she thought it was a neutral choice, maybe she should have asked first? But she might not have known. However, when he expresses discomfort, she tries to understand. He's not being receptive, getting defensive. She offers a solution (switching), but he refuses to budge. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't know about his preference beforehand. But maybe in a relationship, partners should communicate about such things. However, it's not clear if he ever mentioned before about being uncomfortable. The author might have acted without prior knowledge. On the other hand, when he says he's uncomfortable, she tries to accommodate. He's the one refusing to compromise. So maybe the blame isn't fully on her. He's not accepting her effort to switch. The key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. She tried to adjust, he didn't. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to resolve it, while he's being rigid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
