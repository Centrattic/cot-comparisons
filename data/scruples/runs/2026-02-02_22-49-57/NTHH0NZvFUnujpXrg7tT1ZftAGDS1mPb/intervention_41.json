A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking massages for her boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he gets upset and refuses to go. She tried to understand his reasoning about massages being sexual, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's action was to book a male masseuse for her boyfriend, thinking it's purely therapeutic. She tried to engage in a discussion to understand his discomfort, which he attributes to massages being inherently sexual. He feels she's making an argument out of it, while she just wants to understand his logic. \n\nIs it wrong to book a male masseuse? If the boyfriend is uncomfortable, then the author's action may have caused his distress. However, she didn't know he felt that way beforehand. She tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which he rejected. The key point is intent versus outcome. The author's intent was to schedule, but the outcome was the boyfriend's discomfort. But since she made an effort to resolve it, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal could be his personal boundary. If he's uncomfortable, he's entitled to that, but the author's approach was to understand and compromise. The boyfriend's response of canceling might be extreme, but the author is still going without him. \n\nIn terms of social norms, choosing a masseuse's gender isn't typically an issue unless someone has specific discomfort. The author's actions were neutral, but the boyfriend's reaction is based on his perception. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she tried to address his concerns. Therefore, answer B.\n"
