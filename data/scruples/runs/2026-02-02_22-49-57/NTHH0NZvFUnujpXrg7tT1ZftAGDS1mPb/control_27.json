  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse, which he then objects to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author scheduled the massages with same-gender masseuses for both herself and her boyfriend. Her reasoning is that massages are therapeutic. The boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he believes massages have a sexual connotation. He also seems to think that the author is overcomplicating the issue and even suggests canceling the appointments rather than switching.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and understanding. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. It's important to note that the author's initial action was based on her own belief about the nature of massages, which might not have considered her boyfriend's feelings. However, she did make an effort to accommodate his discomfort by offering to switch, which shows she isn't being intentionally difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. But his statement about massages being inherently sexual is a personal belief, and it's valid for him to feel that way. The author is trying to have a discussion, treating it like a debate, which might come across as dismissive of his feelings. However, she's also standing by her own views.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Since she made an effort to adjust and he refused, it's possible that both parties are at fault to some extent. But the main issue is about respecting each other's boundaries. The author scheduled the massages without considering his potential discomfort, which could be seen as a misstep. However, her willingness to adjust shows she's not entirely wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling is also problematic. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have anticipated his discomfort. But since he didn't mention it before, maybe she isn't entirely wrong. However, the fact that she didn't check in with him before booking might be an oversight. But in relationships, people often make decisions they think are best without prior discussion, especially if there's no history of issues. The boyfriend's reaction seems more like a personal issue that he should have communicated earlier. The author's actions, while perhaps not perfect, were based on her own understanding, and she tried to resolve it. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
