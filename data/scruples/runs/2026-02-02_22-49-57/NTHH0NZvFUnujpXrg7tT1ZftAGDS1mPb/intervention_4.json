A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author and her boyfriend both booked massages together, and she chose male and female masseuses respectively. Then the boyfriend objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling. Now she's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort. The author didn't know her boyfriend's preference beforehand. She made a choice based on available options, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue, but she tried to address it by offering to switch. That shows she respects his feelings. However, he's being inflexible and even canceling the appointment. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author overstepped or if she's justified in her actions. Since she didn't know his preferences and made a choice, but then tried to accommodate his concerns, it seems she's not at fault. The boyfriend's reaction is more extreme\u2014refusing to switch and canceling seems like the problem. The author's intention was to understand and adjust, so she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
