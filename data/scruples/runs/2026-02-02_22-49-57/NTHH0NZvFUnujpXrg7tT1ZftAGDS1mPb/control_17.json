A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who planned to get massages together. The author (a woman) booked her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he prefers a female masseuse. The author tries to discuss his reasoning, but he accuses her of being irrational and making it an argument. She offers to switch, but he says to cancel his appointment and doesn't go. The author ends up going without him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author scheduled the massages, possibly without consulting her boyfriend first. But the situation says they \"planned on getting massages together,\" which implies they had a plan. However, when it came to booking, the author chose the masseuse's gender. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because of his belief that massages are sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning, which he dismisses as irrational. He then cancels his appointment, and the author goes ahead without him.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation from both sides. The boyfriend's discomfort is based on his personal belief that massages are sexual. He might feel that a male masseuse could lead to him being objectified or that the situation is inappropriate. The author, on the other hand, sees massages as therapeutic and is trying to facilitate what she thought would work, perhaps assuming gender doesn't matter. \n\nThe author tried to understand his perspective, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The key here is that the author didn't force him into anything. She made an initial decision but was willing to adjust. However, he didn't accept her offers and instead chose not to participate. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like she made a choice that her boyfriend was uncomfortable with, but she was open to changing it. The boyfriend's issue is with the male masseuse, which is a personal preference. The author's action isn't necessarily wrong unless she was being intentionally dismissive. However, she tried to explain her reasoning and offered solutions. The boyfriend's response was more about his own discomfort and not necessarily the author's fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if they had planned to go together, maybe the author should have checked in with him about the masseuse's gender first. But since the situation already happened, and she tried to resolve it, the blame might not be entirely on her. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise could be his own issue. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
