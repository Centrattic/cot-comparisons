  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages together, and she chose based on the available options. The boyfriend then refuses because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and she's trying to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which seems reasonable. She even offered to switch or cancel, which shows she was trying to accommodate his comfort. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that massages have a sexual connotation and is uncomfortable with a male masseuse. He also accuses her of being irrational, which might be the bigger issue here.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. From what I see, she made a choice based on splitting genders, which is common in some contexts. When faced with his discomfort, she tried to resolve it by offering alternatives. The boyfriend's response seems more problematic because he's not open to discussion and dismisses her efforts. The author's actions don't seem malicious; she's trying to understand and compromise. The key point is that she's trying to find a solution, whereas he's refusing to budge. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were reasonable and accommodating, while the boyfriend's refusal without considering alternatives is the issue.\n"
