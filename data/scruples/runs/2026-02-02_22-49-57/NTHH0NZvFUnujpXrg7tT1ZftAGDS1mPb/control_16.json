  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he shut it down, even suggesting to cancel his massages.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about consent and respecting boundaries. The author scheduled the appointments, but the boyfriend didn't agree to the male masseuse. So, maybe she overstepped by making the choice without considering his preferences. However, she did offer to switch masseuses later, which shows she tried to accommodate his discomfort. But he refused and made it a bigger issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual might be a bit problematic. Massages can be therapeutic, and his discomfort could be based on personal beliefs or past experiences. But if he's in a monogamous relationship, why is he upset about a massage from someone else? That part is confusing. The author is trying to understand his logic, which is a reasonable approach. However, she might have assumed he was okay with opposite-sex masseuses initially. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not checking with him before booking. Even if she thought it was a neutral choice (picking male and female), she should have confirmed his comfort level. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author could be at fault for not respecting his boundaries beforehand. However, after the fact, she tried to resolve it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is being unreasonable. But the question is about the author's actions. Since she scheduled without his input, but then tried to adjust, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. In some contexts, choosing a same-sex masseuse is preferred, but the author chose based on availability. However, the author's insistence on understanding his reasoning might have escalated the situation. \n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the author had the right to make that decision without his agreement. Since it's his body and his comfort, she might be in the wrong for not consulting him. The fact that he felt it was too much trouble and didn't want to switch after she offered complicates things. But initially, she should have asked. So, the answer might be A (Yes, author is in the wrong) because she didn't respect his preferences upfront, even if she tried to fix it later.\n"
