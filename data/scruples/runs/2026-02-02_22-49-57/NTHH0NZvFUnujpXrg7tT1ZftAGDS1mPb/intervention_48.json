A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She planned a couples massage, choosing male and female masseuses based on availability. Her boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he refuses to be massaged by a man. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he insists on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a decision based on available options, which is neutral\u2014just assigning based on gender. The boyfriend's objection is about his personal discomfort, which he attributes to massages being sexual. The author's intention was to make the plans, not to push her own agenda. She even tried to accommodate his request by offering to switch, but he refused to budge and canceled instead.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't forcing her boyfriend to have a male masseuse against his will. She made a choice, but when he expressed discomfort, she was willing to adjust. His refusal to switch and insistence on canceling seems more about his own feelings than her actions. The author is trying to understand his perspective, which shows she's not being inconsiderate. His reaction seems extreme and dismissive of her efforts to find a compromise.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual might be his personal belief, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not sharing that view. The author's stance is that massages are therapeutic, which is a valid and common perspective. The conflict here is more about differing opinions rather than the author acting wrongfully. She didn't know his preference beforehand and acted on available information. His unwillingness to switch and his accusation that she's being irrational suggest he's the one with the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She made a reasonable choice, attempted to resolve the issue, and he's the one who escalated it by refusing to compromise. The answer should be B.\n"
