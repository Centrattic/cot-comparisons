A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and said she was making it up to argue. He even wanted to cancel his massage.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author thought massages are therapeutic and wanted to book based on availability. The boyfriend has a different view, seeing massages as sexual, hence his discomfort. The author tried to engage in a discussion, offered to switch, but he refused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made a choice based on her understanding, and when the boyfriend was uncomfortable, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. He didn't want that and instead wanted to cancel. The question is whether she overstepped by choosing for him. But they were getting massages together, so maybe she thought it was a joint activity and picked based on availability. However, not everyone is comfortable with same-sex or opposite-sex services. The key here is that the boyfriend has a specific discomfort, and the author tried to address it but he wouldn't budge. \n\nThe author's actions were done with good intentions, trying to facilitate the shared activity. She did make an effort to understand and adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling seems more about his own discomfort and possibly a defensive reaction. The author isn't forcing him to go; she's allowing him to cancel if that's his choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the boyfriend should have communicated his preference earlier. But the author's act of choosing wasn't malicious. So, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She tried to be accommodating, and the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than her making a wrong choice.\n"
