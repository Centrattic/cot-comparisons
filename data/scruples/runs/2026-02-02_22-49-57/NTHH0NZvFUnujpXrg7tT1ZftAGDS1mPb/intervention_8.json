A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman in a relationship, booked massages for both her boyfriend and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. But then the boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, saying that massages are inherently sexual. The author is trying to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch masseuses, but he refuses and says she's making it an argument. She ends up going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, choosing based on the available options. She might have thought that having same-sex masseuses would be less awkward for both of them. But the boyfriend feels that any opposite-sex masseuse might be sexually suggestive, which makes him uncomfortable. He claims that massages are inherently sexual, which is why he's not okay with it. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for booking the male masseuse for him? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's possible that she didn't consider his possible discomfort. But on the other hand, she tried to accommodate his feelings by offering to switch masseuses. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his dismissal of her attempts to discuss the issue might indicate that he's being rigid. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force him to get a massage; she just booked one. If he's uncomfortable, she tried to adjust. The boyfriend's response might be more about his own discomfort and the way he's handling the situation rather than her actions. However, maybe she should have checked with him first about his preferences. But since it's a shared activity, maybe it's reasonable to assume that she could choose based on availability unless there's a known issue. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual is a belief he holds, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong for not sharing that view. The fact that he ended up not going might make the author feel guilty, but if he was truly uncomfortable, he had the option to cancel or switch. The author's main issue here is the boyfriend's reaction, not the initial booking. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made an assumption but tried to resolve the issue when confronted. The boyfriend's response seems more problematic than her initial action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
