A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he's uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tries to understand his reasoning, but he gets defensive and refuses to switch, leading to a cancellation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a choice based on available options\u2014male and female masseuses. She assigned each of them a masseuse of the opposite sex. That's a reasonable way to split the bookings, especially if they're going together. But the boyfriend has a personal issue with male masseurs because he views massages as sexual. \n\nNow, the key points are: Is it reasonable for the boyfriend to have this boundary? Should the author have considered his comfort level first? The author tried to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic. Some people might feel uncomfortable with same-sex massage therapists for various reasons. However, in a monogamous relationship, maybe the boyfriend's discomfort is more about his own perceptions. The author is trying to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective, which is valid. But he's dismissing her reasoning and escalating the situation by refusing to switch, leading to the cancellation.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for making the initial choice. She didn't know his preference beforehand. It's a common scenario where partners might have different comfort levels. The author's intention was to share the experience, not to push her own view. She even offered to switch, showing she was trying to accommodate. However, his refusal and the argument might be more about his own issues than her choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for scheduling based on the given options. She made an effort to adjust, and his reaction is more about his personal boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
