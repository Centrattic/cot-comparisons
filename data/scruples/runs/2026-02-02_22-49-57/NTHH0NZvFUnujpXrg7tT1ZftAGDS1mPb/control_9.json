  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, and the author tries to discuss it, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought it was a neutral, therapeutic choice, so she might not see any issue. She offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. He then cancels his appointments and refuses to attend if he can't have a female masseuse. \n\nThe key points here are consent and comfort. The author didn't force him to go; she even tried to adjust. He has the right to set his boundaries. However, the author's intention was to book both of them massages without considering his specific discomfort. But the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top\u2014saying the author is wrong and that massages are inherently sexual could be his way of justifying his own discomfort, not necessarily her wrongdoing.\n\nLegally and socially, people can have preferences about their personal space and comfort, especially in situations where someone of the opposite sex is involved. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that she thinks is fair, especially since she made an effort to switch. The boyfriend's refusal to attend after the offer to switch might indicate that his discomfort isn't about the author's choice but his own personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She tried to accommodate his preferences and didn't force him to proceed. His reaction is more about his personal feelings than her mistake.\n"
