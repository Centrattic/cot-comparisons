  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages being sexual.\n\nFirst, the author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend without his input. The boyfriend objects because he feels massages are inherently sexual, which makes him uncomfortable. The author argues that massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's discomfort might be valid; some people feel that massage, especially from the opposite sex, can have sexual undertones. But the author's intention was to have a shared experience and she did offer to switch masseuses later. However, the boyfriend then refused to switch and wanted to cancel entirely. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author didn't consider his initial preference when booking, which could be seen as dismissive. Even though she offered to change after the fact, the initial action might have disregarded his feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to switch could be rigid. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong. If the boyfriend clearly communicates his discomfort and the author ignores it, she's at fault. However, in this case, the author didn't know his preference before booking. So maybe she's not wrong for not knowing. But after he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's reaction could be excessive. \n\nWait, the author scheduled him with a male masseuse without discussing it. Even if the reason is about sexual connotations, the act of booking without considering his comfort might be the problem. The author might be in the wrong for not considering his perspective beforehand. However, the boyfriend's response could also be overly sensitive. \n\nHmm, but the question is about the author's responsibility. The user is asking if she's wrong for scheduling without his input. Since the boyfriend later shows discomfort, maybe she should have asked his preference first. So the answer is AITA for not checking in with him before booking. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she made a decision that affected him without his input, leading to discomfort.\n"
