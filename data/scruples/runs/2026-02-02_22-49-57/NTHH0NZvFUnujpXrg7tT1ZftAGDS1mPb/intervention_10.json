A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The scenario is that they both wanted massages together, and she chose a male masseuse for him and female for herself. He then refuses, saying massages are inherently sexual, and she tried to understand his reasoning but he wasn't open to discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which might be a common assumption, but the boyfriend has a different view. He finds it uncomfortable because he believes massages are sexual, which might be his personal belief. She tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective but he shut it down, calling her irrational and making it an argument. She even offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she made a choice based on what she thought was splitting them by gender, which might be a neutral approach. However, she didn't consider that her boyfriend might have specific discomforts with male masseuses. But she did try to explain her reasoning and offer a solution (switching). His reaction seems more about his own discomfort than her being wrong. \n\nThe question is whether her initial decision was wrong. Since she had no prior knowledge of his discomfort and tried to accommodate, it's more about his personal boundaries. She's not forcing him to accept the male masseuse; she's open to switching. Her actions don't seem malicious. The problem arises from his personal beliefs, not her initial scheduling. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
