  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages, and she assigned them based on gender. The boyfriend then refused the male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he got defensive, called her irrational, and said she was making it up. He even refused to switch and suggested canceling.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a decision based on the available masseuses, splitting by gender. The boyfriend had a strong reaction, which seems to be about personal comfort and boundaries. The author tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective but faced resistance. The boyfriend's argument that massages are sexual might be a personal belief, but the author believes they're therapeutic. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and confrontational.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was to assign the male masseuse to her boyfriend. Since the boyfriend had a clear discomfort, maybe the author should have checked with him first? But on the other hand, the boyfriend didn't mention his preference beforehand. The author might not know his boundaries without him communicating. However, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he dismissed her attempts to understand and made her the issue when she was trying to be accommodating.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual but it's okay in a monogamous relationship is a bit confusing. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, maybe he's okay with a female one, but the author's offering to switch shows she's trying. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and suggesting cancellation instead might be him being inflexible. The author was willing to switch, but he didn't want to switch and instead wanted to cancel. That seems like his own issue.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author should have considered his possible discomfort beforehand. However, it's not like she forced him. She assigned the masseuse without prior knowledge of his preference. So perhaps she isn't in the wrong because she had no way of knowing. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own boundaries not being communicated, and his response is dismissive and argumentative rather than collaborative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could have communicated better. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be no. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are more problematic here. The author tried to be understanding, offered to switch, and was open to discussion, while he was rigid and confrontational. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
