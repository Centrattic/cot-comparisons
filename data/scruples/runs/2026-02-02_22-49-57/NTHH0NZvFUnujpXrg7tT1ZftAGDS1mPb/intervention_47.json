A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and she chose male for him and female for herself. He's upset because he thinks massages with the opposite sex are inherently sexual, even though they're in a monogamous relationship. She tried to discuss it, offer to switch, but he refused and wants to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author probably thought it's a neutral, therapeutic activity, so she chose based on availability or maybe gender balance. Her boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexual. But she's trying to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she respects his feelings. However, he's being rigid and not compromising, which could be an issue.\n\nIs the author wrong for making the choice? She didn't know his preference beforehand. It's possible she didn't consider his feelings, but she tried to address it when he brought it up. The key points are: she made the booking without knowing his stance, tried to communicate and adjust, but he refused. His reaction seems extreme, but his initial stance is about his comfort. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She made an effort to talk it out and find a solution. He, on the other hand, didn't communicate his preferences earlier and now is making it a deal-breaker. The fact that he's unwilling to compromise might mean he's being unreasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to resolve the issue, even if she could have checked preferences first. So the answer is B.\n"
