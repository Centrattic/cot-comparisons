A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and she chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. The boyfriend then refused because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and felt uncomfortable. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's action was based on practicality\u2014maybe she thought pairing same-sex masseuses would be straightforward. She might not have considered his personal discomfort, which is valid. The boyfriend has the right to his boundaries, especially regarding his comfort with opposite-sex interactions. However, the author tried to communicate and even offered to switch, showing she wasn't being inconsiderate. The boyfriend's response seems a bit harsh, dismissing her perspective and refusing to compromise beyond cancellation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She didn't know he had that specific issue. It's possible she should have asked his preference first instead of assuming. But she did try to switch when he expressed discomfort, so she was accommodating. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his accusation that she's making it up might indicate his own issues. The author's intention was neutral, and she was open to adjusting. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
