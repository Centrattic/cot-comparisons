A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and the author booked the boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and said she was being irrational. The author offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The author booked the appointments, but the boyfriend had his own preferences. However, the author did offer to switch, which shows she was trying to accommodate his discomfort. The key points here are about consent and respecting personal boundaries. The author didn't force him; she gave him options. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort and maybe overreacting. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual is a personal belief, but the author is challenging that by pointing out it's therapeutic. The debate here is about differing opinions. The author's intention was to provide a service they both agreed to, but the boyfriend's refusal is based on his own interpretation. Since the author was trying to understand and adjust, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise and his dismissive attitude might be the issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
