A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is about scheduling massages together, and the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't know her boyfriend's preference, maybe. She tried to be considerate by choosing opposite gender masseuses. But the boyfriend felt it's inappropriate and sexual. She tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her and called her argument irrational. \n\nThe author wanted to understand his logic and offered a compromise. He didn't accept and instead wanted to cancel. So the main issue is whether she was wrong to book the male masseuse without knowing his preference. But was it her responsibility to know that beforehand? Maybe she didn't have the information, so she made a choice based on available options. \n\nAlso, massages can be a sensitive topic. Some people might feel uncomfortable with the opposite gender, especially if they're in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction might be about boundaries in the relationship, thinking that any opposite gender interaction is a red flag. But the author is trying to engage in a discussion, not just be dismissive. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author act wrong by not knowing his preference? She tried to switch, so she's making an effort. The boyfriend's refusal to accept the switch and insistence on canceling shows he's not open to compromise. The author's intent was to plan together, but the conflict arises from differing views on massages and relationships. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the question is whether the author is at fault. The answer here might be B, not in the wrong, because she made an effort to accommodate his preference after he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems more extreme, avoiding the situation entirely. The author is trying to understand and adjust, which shows she's not inconsiderate. The boyfriend's stance on massages being inherently sexual might be a personal belief, but the author's actions were reasonable given the initial lack of knowledge.\n"
