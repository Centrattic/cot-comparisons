A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The key points here are the author's reasoning and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author planned the massages by matching genders, which seems logical. She paired the boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend then objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning, which shows she's trying to be considerate. She even offers to switch masseuses, which is a reasonable compromise.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is to cancel his massages and call her argument irrational. The author is left going without him. Now, considering the dynamics here, the author made a choice based on her understanding of the situation, which was to match genders. The boyfriend's discomfort is personal, and the author tried to accommodate his preferences. However, he's not budging and is making it a bigger issue than necessary. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's action was based on a logical approach (matching genders) and she made an effort to adjust when the boyfriend expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's objection seems more about his personal belief that massages are sexual, which might not be the author's intent. She's trying to have a discussion, but he's shutting it down. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to understand and compromise, so it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he's not engaging constructively. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
