A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is at fault here. The situation is that she and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. He got upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to understand his logic and even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his massage and she still went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she did something wrong. The key points here are consent and understanding each other's boundaries. She scheduled the massages based on her understanding that they are therapeutic. He has a different view, finding it uncomfortable with a male masseuse. Her response was to try to discuss and find a solution, like switching. But he refused, leading her to go without him. \n\nIs it wrong to schedule someone with a masseuse of the opposite sex if they're uncomfortable? Well, she didn't realize his discomfort beforehand, so she made a choice based on her own perspective. However, once he expressed his feelings, she tried to accommodate. He then dismissed her efforts and suggested cancellation, but she went ahead anyway. \n\nThe question is whether she overstepped by initially booking the male masseuse. Since he had a personal boundary and she didn't know about it when she made the reservation, maybe she didn't intend to make him uncomfortable. But she should have considered that personal preferences might differ and perhaps discussed it before booking. However, in the scenario, she did offer to switch after he expressed discomfort, which shows willingness to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014cancelling the appointment and then her going without him. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not at fault. From a general standpoint, unless there was prior knowledge of the discomfort, the initial scheduling isn't necessarily wrong. However, once he says no, she should respect that. But she tried to switch, which he didn't accept. Her going without him might be within her rights, as it's her choice. The main issue is the boyfriend's discomfort and his reaction. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She made an effort to understand and adjust, and the boyfriend's refusal to honor the switch, combined with his assertion that it's sexual, is more about his personal boundaries. The author's actions, while maybe not considering the sensitivity beforehand, were not malicious. She's responsible for her own choice once the situation is resolved where he's not attending.\n"
