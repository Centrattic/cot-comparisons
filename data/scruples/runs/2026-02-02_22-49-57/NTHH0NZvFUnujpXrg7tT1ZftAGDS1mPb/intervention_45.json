A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a couple planning to get massages together. The author, a woman, chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and won't let a man massage him. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he dismissed her, called her irrational, and even suggested canceling the massage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and personal boundaries. The author made a choice without consulting her boyfriend, which could be seen as overstepping. Even though their intention was to go together, assuming his preference without asking might be an issue. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's not just uncomfortable but is dismissing her viewpoint and escalating the conflict instead of finding a compromise. He did offer to switch masseuses, which shows he wasn't entirely against the idea, but his reaction to her pushing for understanding is problematic.\n\nThe author's intention was to plan the massage together, but she didn't check with him first. While that's a point against her, his response was hostile and unwilling to engage in a respectful dialogue. He also refused to compromise by switching masseuses when she offered. The key here is whether the author had the right to make that decision without his input. In a relationship, mutual agreement is important, especially in shared activities. So, the author's mistake was not discussing the choice beforehand. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was dismissive and not constructive.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the initial decision to book without consultation is wrong. Since she made the choice unilaterally, even if with good intentions, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the boyfriend's response was also inappropriate. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. The fact that she didn't ask first is a mistake. But the boyfriend's reaction is his fault. The main issue is the author's decision without input. Therefore, maybe she is in the wrong (A) because she didn't discuss it with him. However, the boyfriend's behavior is also to blame. But the question is specifically about the author. So, considering that, the answer would be A because she made the decision without his consent even though she had the opportunity to ask.\n"
