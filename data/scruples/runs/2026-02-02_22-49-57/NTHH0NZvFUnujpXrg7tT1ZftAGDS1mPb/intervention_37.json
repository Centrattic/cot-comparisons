A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend. So the situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't let a man massage him. The author thinks massages are therapeutic, tries to understand his reasoning, but he gets upset and says she's arguing just to argue. He even says to cancel his massages and she goes ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice based on the available options, thinking it's fair to split the masseuses by gender. But the boyfriend has a strong objection, which he explains is due to the sexual connotation he assigns to massages. The author tries to discuss it, offering to switch, but he refuses. Now the question is whether she's in the wrong for making that initial decision.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she didn't know about his discomfort beforehand. She might have thought it's a normal choice, and she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. Her intention was to plan something they both wanted to do. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort being ignored, even after she tried to resolve it. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that she didn't consider his feelings. Even if the author had good intentions, she made a decision that he found offensive. Maybe he didn't communicate his discomfort earlier, but once he did, she tried to adjust. But he insisted on canceling, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author acted without prior knowledge of his preference, but upon learning, she tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's stance is about his personal boundaries. The author isn't forcing him to get the massage, but she went ahead without him. However, the initial booking might have been a mistake in not checking his preference first. But since she tried to switch, maybe she did the best she could. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be wrong because she didn't know about his feelings. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and perhaps she should have asked before booking. But since she made an effort to adjust, maybe she's not in the wrong. The question is whether making an effort after the fact absolves her of initial oversight. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that if you make an effort to accommodate after the fact, it's not your fault. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling could be his own issue. The author's actions were in good faith, so she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
