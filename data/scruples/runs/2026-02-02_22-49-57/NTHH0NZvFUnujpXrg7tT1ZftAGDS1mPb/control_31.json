  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (a woman who booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse) is in the wrong. The boyfriend got upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refused to go with the male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he ended up saying it's too much trouble and she still went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a choice based on the available options (male and female masseuses). She assigned her boyfriend to the male one and herself to the female. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he perceives massages as sexual, especially with the opposite sex. He feels the author is being argumentative, while she was trying to understand his logic. She even offered to switch, but he refused and canceled.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong in making that choice. From an ethical standpoint, the author didn't have malicious intent. She might have thought it was a neutral decision, splitting the available options. However, the boyfriend's comfort and boundaries are important. The author did offer to switch, showing she was willing to accommodate his feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since he didn't express his discomfort beforehand. But maybe he felt it's a personal choice and didn't want to discuss it. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She tried to communicate and adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his accusation that she's being irrational might indicate his own inflexibility. However, it's also about respecting his boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse because of his beliefs about massages being sexual, then the author's initial choice might have crossed his boundaries, even if unintentionally. She could have asked his preference first instead of assuming. \n\nBut in this case, she did offer to switch after he expressed discomfort. That shows she's trying to be accommodating. The fact that he then canceled and accused her of making it into an argument might mean he's not open to discussion. However, the initial act of assigning the male masseuse to him without his input could be seen as dismissive of his potential discomfort. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she had asked his preference first, maybe she could have avoided the issue. But in the situation as presented, she made a choice based on available options and then tried to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings and unwillingness to compromise. The author's intention was to understand and switch if needed, which she did. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: The author's argument that massages are therapeutic versus his view that they're sexual is a difference in opinion. She tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective. He dismissed her as irrational. The author's actions (booking him with a male masseuse) might have been a mistake in not checking his preference first, but once he expressed discomfort, she offered to switch. The boyfriend's refusal and subsequent cancellation shows his own inflexibility. The author's decision to go ahead without him after he canceled might be seen as standing by her choice, which is her right. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's initial action might not have been malicious, and she attempted to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's rigid stance and dismissal of her reasoning could be the main problem here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
