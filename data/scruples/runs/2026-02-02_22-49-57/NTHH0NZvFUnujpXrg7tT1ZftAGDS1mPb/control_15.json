A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse while the author has a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to explain and even offered to switch, but the boyfriend said to cancel his massages. The author is going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author made a choice based on their own understanding of massages being therapeutic. They might have thought it was a fair split, male and female masseuses. But the boyfriend's discomfort is valid because he associates massages with sexuality. His reaction is about personal boundaries and comfort. The author tried to discuss it, which is good, but the boyfriend's stance is that it's a deal-breaker. \n\nIs the author wrong for scheduling him with a male masseuse? Well, they didn't know his preference beforehand. The issue is that the author didn't check with him first. Assuming that their choice is neutral might be the mistake here. The boyfriend's discomfort is significant enough that he refuses to proceed. The author's intention was to have a shared activity, but the boyfriend's boundaries are being crossed. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if they didn't ask first. However, the boyfriend's reasoning (massages being inherently sexual) is a personal belief, and the author had no way of knowing. The key point is whether the author was wrong in making the decision without prior discussion. In relationships, communication is key. Even if the author's intention was good, not checking with the partner about such a personal matter could be a misstep. \n\nBut the boyfriend's response is also extreme, saying to cancel the massages and not going. The author is going without him, which shows they respect their own choice. So, the question is: who is wrong? The author acted without considering the boyfriend's possible discomfort, which could be a mistake. However, the boyfriend's reasoning is subjective. The answer hinges on whether the author is at fault for not communicating better. In many cases, people might say that the author should have discussed the choice first. Therefore, the author might be at least partially in the wrong. But maybe the boyfriend's reaction is over the top. \n\nIn the end, the author's intent was to plan something nice, but not consulting the partner on a personal matter could be the issue. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they made a decision that affected the boyfriend's comfort without checking first. However, the boyfriend's reasoning is his own belief, which is valid. But the main fault lies in the author not considering the partner's preferences. So, the answer is A."
