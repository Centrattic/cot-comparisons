A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. So, the situation is that they both wanted massages. The author chose a male for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author is trying to understand his reasoning, maybe as a debate, and offered to switch. He then wants to cancel his massage and the author is going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's discomfort is about the male masseuse, thinking massages are sexual. But the author thinks they're purely therapeutic. The key here is consent and comfort. The boyfriend had to agree to the massage, but the issue is the gender of the masseuse. The author might not have realized his discomfort with male masseurs, especially since it's related to the perception of massage being sexual. \n\nHowever, the author tried to explain and even offered a solution by switching. But the boyfriend reacted strongly, wanting to cancel. The author is going ahead anyway, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. But also, the boyfriend's reasoning might be based on a personal discomfort or misunderstanding about massages. \n\nIs the author wrong for making the choice? Well, the boyfriend was in the relationship and they were planning together. The author assumed the male masseuse was okay, but he clearly wasn't comfortable. Maybe she should have asked his preference beforehand. But she did offer to switch, which shows she was trying to accommodate. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's sexual in a monogamous relationship is a bit confusing. If they're monogamous, maybe he's okay with female masseuses but not male ones? That could be a boundary issue. The author is trying to understand, but he's defensive. \n\nThe author's intent was to schedule the massages, and when faced with opposition, she's willing to go without him. That's her choice, but maybe she should have respected his no from the start. However, since the initial plan was mutual and he changed his mind later, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to find a compromise. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about how the situation was handled. The author could have checked his preference first, but since she did offer to switch and he still refused, she's not necessarily wrong for proceeding. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't at fault for not knowing it unless she had prior knowledge. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author tried to discuss and offer alternatives. The boyfriend's stance might be a personal issue, and the author isn't wrong for wanting to understand and then going ahead if compromise isn't possible.\n"
