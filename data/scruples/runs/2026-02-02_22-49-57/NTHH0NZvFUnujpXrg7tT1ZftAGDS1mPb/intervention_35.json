  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a couple getting massages together. The author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wants to cancel. The author is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: the author made a choice based on available options, the boyfriend has a personal discomfort with male masseurs due to a belief that massages are sexual, and the author tried to discuss and find a compromise but he wasn't receptive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. My initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong because she made a reasonable decision and tried to accommodate his preferences. However, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from his own biases or discomfort. But maybe there's a nuance here. Was there a reason she chose the male masseuse over the female? Did she consider his preferences beforehand? The story says she just picked based on availability and then tried to adjust when he objected. That seems fair.\n\nBut some might argue that she should have checked with him first before booking. But the scenario doesn't mention that she knew his preference ahead of time. So she might not have had the opportunity to discuss it until after booking. In that case, her responsibility isn't there. Also, she offered to switch, which shows willingness to compromise. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on cancellation might be his own rigidity.\n\nAnother angle is the debate about whether massages are sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic, the boyfriend the opposite. It's a difference in opinion. She wanted to engage in a discussion, which is healthy, but he shut it down and refused to budge. His behavior could be problematic, but the question is about the author's fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions don't seem wrong. She made a choice, tried to adjust, and the issue is more about his personal beliefs and how he handled the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
