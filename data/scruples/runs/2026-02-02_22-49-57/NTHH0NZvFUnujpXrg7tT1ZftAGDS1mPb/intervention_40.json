A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the appropriateness of a male masseuse due to the boyfriend's belief that massages are inherently sexual. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author scheduled the massages as a couple's activity, choosing based on available options (male and female masseuses). She assumed a therapeutic intent, but her boyfriend felt uncomfortable because he views massages as sexual. The key points are mutual respect, communication, and understanding each other's boundaries.\n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch masseuses, and even went along without him when he decided to cancel. She approached the situation with openness to discussion and compromise. However, her boyfriend dismissed her perspective as irrational and refused to engage further, instead walking away from the plans. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's comfort levels. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, as some people do see massages as intimate or potentially sexual. However, the author's initial action wasn't malicious; she made a choice based on available options and intended a shared therapeutic experience. Her attempts to accommodate his feelings by offering a switch show effort to resolve the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction escalated the situation by refusing to engage in discussion and canceling, which might indicate a lack of willingness to find a middle ground. The author's persistence in trying to understand his viewpoint, despite his resistance, suggests she's trying to maintain the relationship's harmony. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were reasonable. She made a choice, faced a conflict, and tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's rigid stance and dismissal of her efforts might be more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
