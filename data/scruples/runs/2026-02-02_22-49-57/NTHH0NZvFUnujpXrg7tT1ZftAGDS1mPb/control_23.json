A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They both wanted massages. The author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning. They argue, he says it's not okay, and she ends up going without him.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are consent and comfort. The boyfriend didn't agree to the male masseuse, and he's clearly uncomfortable. The author tried to discuss and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. She went ahead anyway. But wait, the author mentions she scheduled him, implying she made the decision without his input. That might be an issue. However, she tried to explain her reasoning and offered solutions. \n\nBut the main problem is that she made a decision without his consent. Even if she thought it was fair (male and female), he had a strong objection. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. By not letting him choose and pushing through her decision, she might have overstepped. But she also tried to resolve it by offering to switch. However, he said he wouldn't go with a male masseuse, so she should have respected that. \n\nOn the other hand, he dismissed her attempts to understand his reasoning, called her irrational, and refused to compromise. That shows he's not being open-minded either. But the question is about the author's actions. She made a choice without his input and then proceeded despite his discomfort. So maybe she's partially at fault. However, the boyfriend's reaction might also be problematic. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author scheduled him without consulting him first. Even if she thought it was fair, he had a valid reason (comfort). So she should have asked him first. Therefore, she's in the wrong for making the decision unilaterally. Answer A.\n"
