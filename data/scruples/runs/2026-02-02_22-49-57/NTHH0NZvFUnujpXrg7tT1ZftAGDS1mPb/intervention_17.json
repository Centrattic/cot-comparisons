  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse, which he objects to because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and suggested canceling the massage. The user thinks the author is not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a choice based on available options, not knowing the boyfriend's preference. The boyfriend's objection is about his personal discomfort with male masseuses, which he links to massages being sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion but the boyfriend became defensive and dismissive.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author didn't have prior knowledge of the boyfriend's preference. It's common for people to have different boundaries, and the author's intention was to accommodate their partner by switching, but the boyfriend refused. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own discomfort rather than the author's intent. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for making an initial choice without knowing, especially since the options were split by gender. They also attempted to resolve the issue by offering to switch. The boyfriend's response, however, was to cancel rather than find a compromise. The author then proceeds without him, which is a reasonable reaction given the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the boyfriend's rigidity and the author's attempt to understand his perspective, which shouldn't be blamed. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
