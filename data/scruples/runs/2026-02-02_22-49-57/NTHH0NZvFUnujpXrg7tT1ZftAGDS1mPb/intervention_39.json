A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their boyfriend about the gender of the masseuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author chose a male masseuse for their boyfriend and a female one for themselves. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, claiming massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are purely therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. They even offered to switch masseuses, but he insisted on canceling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they might have thought it's a normal choice, not considering the boyfriend's discomfort. But the boyfriend has a valid reason based on his personal feelings. The author tried to discuss and understand, which seems reasonable. Offering to change masseuses shows willingness to accommodate. However, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence on canceling might indicate that the author's initial choice, while not malicious, overlooked his specific needs. But since the author made an effort to adjust, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have asked the boyfriend's preference before booking. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is at fault. The author's actions led to a conflict, but they tried to resolve it. If the author had known beforehand, maybe they would have asked. However, the situation isn't necessarily about right or wrong but differing perspectives. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to get a massage from someone he's uncomfortable with; they offered to switch. The boyfriend's stance seems more about his personal belief, and the author's response was accommodating. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
