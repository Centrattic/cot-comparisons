  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points here are about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend and his subsequent discomfort.\n\nFirst, the author (a woman) and her boyfriend (a man) both wanted massages. She chose male for him and female for herself. He then refuses, saying massages are inherently sexual. She tries to discuss it, offering to switch masseuses, but he insists on canceling. She goes without him. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to divide the masseuses based on gender, possibly believing in equal treatment or thinking it's neutral. The boyfriend feels uncomfortable with male masseuse, associating massages with sexual connotations. His reaction is about his personal boundaries and comfort. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as not respecting his feelings initially. Even though she offered to switch, the fact that he still canceled could imply that she didn't anticipate his discomfort. However, she tried to understand his reasoning and offered a solution. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend has the right to his comfort level, especially in a service that he finds personal. The author, while trying to be neutral, might have overlooked his specific needs. But she did make an effort to resolve it. \n\nThe debate here is about whether the author should have considered the boyfriend's potential discomfort upfront. Maybe she assumed that splitting by gender was neutral, but the boyfriend's reaction shows it's not. However, the author's intention wasn't to make it an argument but to understand. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to discuss it, but the boyfriend's reaction escalated. The question is if her initial choice was wrong. Since she didn't know about his discomfort until after the fact, maybe she wasn't wrong. But some might argue that she should have been more considerate of his possible feelings. \n\nIn the end, the boyfriend's right to his comfort is important. The author made an effort to resolve it, but he chose to cancel. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried to adapt. But others might say she should have known better. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since she made an effort and had no prior knowledge of his specific issue.\n"
