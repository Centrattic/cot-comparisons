A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset because he felt massages are inherently sexual and didn't want a male masseuse. The author thought it was just a therapeutic, so she tried to reason with him. But he said she was being irrational and argued that she was making it a problem. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might have thought she was being considerate by trying to split the masseuses based on gender. But maybe she didn't consider his boundaries or feelings. However, massages can be seen as non-sexual, so her reasoning isn't entirely wrong. On the other hand, she did respect his initial choice by offering to switch, but he refused. The key points are about mutual respect and communication.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexual. He has the right to set boundaries. The author tried to understand his perspective but might not have respected his boundaries enough. But she was also trying to discuss it, not force her will. The argument escalated because he felt she was being argumentative instead of respecting his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's comfort levels. Even if her intention was good, if he's uncomfortable, she should accommodate. However, she did offer to switch, which shows she tried. But he refused, so maybe she shouldn't push further. The fact that he wanted to cancel suggests that the issue is more about his personal boundaries than her being wrong. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. She tried to communicate and adjust. But perhaps she should have checked with him first before booking. However, since she did offer to switch, maybe it's his discomfort that's the main issue. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because she was trying to be understanding and made accommodations.\n"
