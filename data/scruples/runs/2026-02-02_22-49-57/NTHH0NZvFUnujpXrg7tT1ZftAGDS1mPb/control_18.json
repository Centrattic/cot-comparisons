A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves the boyfriend being uncomfortable with a male masseus, thinking massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author booked the massages as a couple, choosing based on available options. The boyfriend's objection is about the gender of the masseuse, which he links to the sexual nature of massages. The author defends her choice by seeing massages as therapeutic and tries to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective. She even offers a compromise, but he remains firm.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she made a decision based on available options and wanted to split the services. It's not like she forced him without considering his feelings. She did offer to adjust, showing she tried to accommodate his discomfort. The boyfriend's insistence that massages are sexual might be his personal belief, but the author isn't obligated to agree. She's within her rights to have differing views and to make a choice she's comfortable with, especially when she's made an effort to resolve the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has valid discomforts that should be respected. But the question is about the author's actions. Since she tried to understand, offered solutions, and he still refused, her actions don't seem to be in the wrong. She's not forcing him to accept something he's uncomfortable with; she just wanted to proceed with her choice. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
