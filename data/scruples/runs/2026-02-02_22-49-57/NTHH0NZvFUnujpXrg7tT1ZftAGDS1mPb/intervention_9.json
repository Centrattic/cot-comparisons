A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages, there were two options: male and female. The author, being female, booked the female masseuse for herself and the male one for her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, thinking massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author did something wrong. The main points here are about autonomy and communication. The author made a choice based on available options, perhaps assuming that the boyfriend would be okay with it. But the boyfriend has a personal boundary about male masseuses. The author tried to understand his reasoning, which is a good step. She even offered a solution (switching), but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going through with the plan, which might be seen as her standing her ground.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The author didn't force him; she scheduled the massage, but when he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's issue is about his own comfort with the male masseuse, which is a personal boundary. The author's initial action of booking him with a male masseuse might be seen as not considering his preference, but she didn't know his preference beforehand. However, once he expressed it, she made an effort to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction (saying it's too much trouble) and his claim that the author is arguing just to be argumentative might indicate he's being inflexible.\n\nThe key question is whether the author had a duty to check his preference before booking. In relationships, partners should communicate about such things, but if it's the first time he's ever expressed discomfort with male masseuses, maybe the author didn't know. However, she could have asked. But in the scenario, it seems she didn't, and now he's upset. The author's intent was to split the masseuses, which might be a reasonable approach, but not considering his potential discomfort could be a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being inherently sexual might be his personal belief, but if he's okay with opposite-sex massages in a monogamous relationship, that's a contradiction the author pointed out. His response of being dismissive and wanting to cancel might make him the one being unreasonable. The author's persistence in wanting to understand his logic is a positive communication effort, though he didn't appreciate it.\n\nSo, the author's action of booking the male masseuse could be seen as a misstep because she didn't check his preference first. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction is arguably more problematic because he's not engaging in constructive dialogue and is taking it personally. The author isn't forcing him to go; he can choose to cancel, but she decides to go without him, which is her right. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's boundaries. The author might have made an assumption, but the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort and unwillingness to compromise. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since she made an effort to resolve the issue once he expressed his feelings. The boyfriend is the one who might be at fault here for being rigid and not respecting the author's attempt to accommodate him.\n"
