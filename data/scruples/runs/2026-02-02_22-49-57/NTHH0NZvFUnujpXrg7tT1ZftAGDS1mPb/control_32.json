  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when both are getting massages. The author chose the male for him and female for herself. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and that the author is wrong. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. Now the author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. The author made a decision based on availability, assigning male masseuse to her boyfriend and female to herself. The boyfriend feels uncomfortable because he believes massages are sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which the boyfriend dismissed as arguing. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his personal discomfort, while the author's action was a neutral scheduling choice. \n\nThe key points: The author didn't know the boyfriend's preference beforehand. She tried to be understanding, offered to switch, but he refused. He accused her of making it up to argue. The author's intention was to understand, not to push boundaries. The boyfriend's stance is that massages are sexual, but the author sees them as therapeutic. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and wanting to cancel might indicate that his discomfort is significant. However, the author isn't forcing him; she's allowing him to cancel. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for making an initial scheduling choice without knowing his preference? Probably not. She had no way of knowing his objection. Her actions were neutral. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his personal beliefs and discomfort, which he should have communicated earlier. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, showing she's considerate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
