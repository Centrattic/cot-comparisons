  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual, and he refused to go. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's intention was to split the available masseuses by gender, which seems reasonable. She wanted to understand his discomfort, which is a good approach. The boyfriend, however, feels that massages have a sexual connotation and is uncomfortable with a male masseuse. That's his personal boundary. \n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic because they involve close physical contact. While some people see them as purely therapeutic, others might associate them with intimacy. The author might not have considered that her boyfriend has this perspective, but once she knew, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. However, he refused, which is his right if he feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by initially booking without considering his feelings. Maybe she didn't realize his discomfort before scheduling. But once she did, she made an effort to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, but his discomfort is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to make a choice that seemed fair and then addressing his concerns. She's not forcing him to go; he chose to cancel. So, the answer is likely B (no).\n"
