A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a female, scheduled her boyfriend (a male) with a male masseuse, while she chose a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he says massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. He wants to cancel his massage, and the author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic and she thought it was a straightforward scheduling choice. She tried to discuss his reasoning but he dismissed her as arguing. She offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is now going to proceed without him.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's side, he feels that having a male masseuse is uncomfortable because he associates massages with being sexual. He might feel that a male masseuse could lead to inappropriate situations or that it's against his boundaries. His refusal to switch and to cancel the appointment might indicate that he's not willing to compromise despite the offer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points are consent and respect for boundaries. The author thought it was a therapeutic choice, but the boyfriend has a different view. Even though she tried to understand his reasoning, he felt it was an argument. However, she did offer a solution (switching masseuses), which he refused. He now wants to cancel, but maybe he's overreacting. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If the author didn't know about her boyfriend's discomfort beforehand, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But by scheduling the male masseuse, she might have disregarded his potential feelings without prior discussion. However, he had the option to communicate his discomfort earlier. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being inherently sexual might be a bit extreme. Massage therapy is generally seen as therapeutic, but individual experiences or beliefs can vary. The author's intention was to have a shared activity, and she made an effort to accommodate by offering a switch. His refusal to switch and wanting to cancel might be seen as inflexible.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author tried to address the problem and offered a solution. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his discomfort and perhaps not considering that the author didn't know his feelings beforehand. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for scheduling the male masseuse without prior knowledge. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and canceling might be his own issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
