A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: They planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss it, but he got defensive, said she was arguing, and eventually wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The key points are about respecting boundaries and communication. The boyfriend expressed discomfort with male masseuses due to his belief that massages have sexual connotations. Even if the author disagrees, she initially scheduled the appointment. When he expressed discomfort, she tried to adjust by offering to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate. However, he refused further and wanted to cancel. \n\nIs the author wrong for initially making the choice without discussing it first? Maybe. She might have assumed it was fine, but since he has strong feelings, she should have checked with him before booking. However, once the conflict arose, she made an effort to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort and perhaps overreacting, but the author's initial choice might have been careless. \n\nBut in relationships, people have differing views. The author's intention was to have a shared activity. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise beyond canceling might be his responsibility. The author isn't forcing him; she's trying to understand and even offer alternatives. So, while there's room for improvement in communication, the author isn't entirely at fault here. The boyfriend is also being rigid. \n\nThe answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she made an effort to address his concerns after the fact. However, if the initial scheduling was without his input, maybe A. But I think the key is that she tried to resolve it. So B seems right.\n"
