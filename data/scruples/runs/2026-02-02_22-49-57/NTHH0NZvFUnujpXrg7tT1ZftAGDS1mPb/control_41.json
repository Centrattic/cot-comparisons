A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages and their perceived sexuality.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse, expecting it to be a therapeutic experience. Her boyfriend is uncomfortable because he believes massages are inherently sexual. She tries to discuss this, but he dismisses her and refuses to switch, even suggesting cancellation. The question is about her responsibility here.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend has a valid personal boundary. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, it's his right to express that. The author should respect his boundaries. However, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's response is a bit dismissive. He labels her opinion as irrational and accuses her of arguing for no reason. This could indicate a lack of respect for her perspective. But the main issue is whether the author overstepped by not initially respecting his potential discomfort. However, she didn't know his feelings beforehand, and she did offer to change the booking once informed. \n\nThe crux here is about mutual respect and communication. The author acted based on her understanding and then tried to adjust when he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and the argument over the nature of massages might be his own issues. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to accommodate his feelings after he expressed them. The boyfriend's reaction was more about his personal views and not necessarily her fault. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
