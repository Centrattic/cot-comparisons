A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author, being female, chose a female masseuse for herself and a male for her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he refuses to go with the male masseuse. The author tried to discuss his reasoning, but he accused her of being irrational and making up arguments to debate. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She still went without him. The user wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend's discomfort with a male masseuse. The author made a choice based on availability, perhaps assuming that gender didn't matter. But the boyfriend has a different view, seeing massages as sexual, which is why he's against it. The author tried to understand his perspective, but he dismissed her and escalated the conflict by wanting to cancel. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's action was to assign the male masseuse to her boyfriend, which he found offensive. But is scheduling based on available options inherently wrong? It depends on the context. If the boyfriend had previously expressed discomfort with male masseuses, the author might have been negligent. However, the situation states that the author didn't know his stance before making the booking. She tried to communicate and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to resolve the issue. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's making a claim that massages are inherently sexual, which is a personal belief. The author is trying to engage in a discussion, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to accept any compromise (like switching masseuses) and his dismissal of her arguments might be the root of the problem. The author is in a relationship where she's trying to accommodate his comfort level but is met with resistance and accusations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author made an effort to understand and accommodate, which is commendable. The boyfriend's rigidity and unwillingness to find a middle ground (like switching) could be the issue. The author isn't forcing him to go with a male masseuse; she offered to switch, which he rejected. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she made a reasonable choice and tried to address his concerns. The boyfriend's stance, while his own belief, might be causing unnecessary conflict without valid reasoning. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
