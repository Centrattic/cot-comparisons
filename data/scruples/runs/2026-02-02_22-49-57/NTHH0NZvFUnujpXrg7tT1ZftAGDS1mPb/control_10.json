A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse, but he's uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're just therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice based on their belief that massages are therapeutic. They might have thought it was fair to split the genders, assuming that the boyfriend would be okay with a male masseuse. The boyfriend, however, has a strong opinion that masses with the opposite sex are sexual, even in a monogamous relationship. He's uncomfortable and wants to cancel his appointment.\n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch masseuses, but he was resistant. Now the question is, is the author at fault?\n\nI think it's about autonomy and respect. The author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, but the boyfriend decided to cancel. The author's intention wasn't to make an issue but to split the appointments. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the author isn't forcing him to do anything. They still went through with their own massage. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They made a choice, tried to be understanding, and the boyfriend's reaction is his own issue. The author isn't forcing him to be uncomfortable. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
