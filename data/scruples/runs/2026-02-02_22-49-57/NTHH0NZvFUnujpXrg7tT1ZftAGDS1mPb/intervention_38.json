  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation where she scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and he got upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. So, first, I need to understand the dynamics here.\n\nThe author wanted to get massages together with her boyfriend. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. He wasn't okay with that because he feels massages are sexual. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his appointment. She's going ahead without him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author made a decision based on the available options. She split the genders, which is common when booking services like massages. Her reasoning was practical\u2014maybe to avoid both having the same gender, or just a random choice. But her boyfriend has a different perspective. He believes massages have a sexual connotation, which makes him uncomfortable with a male masseuse. That's his personal belief, even if it's not widely accepted.\n\nShe tried to engage in a discussion, which is good. She was trying to understand his reasons, not just dismiss them. That shows she's respectful. When he refused to switch and wanted to cancel, she still went through with her own appointment. That seems like she's standing by her choice, which is her right unless it's causing harm.\n\nIs there any fault here? Maybe the initial booking without his input? But when planning together, sometimes one person makes a decision, assuming the other is okay. However, if he has a strong objection, maybe she should have checked with him first. But she didn't know about his feelings until after she booked. So maybe she didn't know. \n\nHe's being rigid and not open to her perspective. She's trying to understand but he's shutting down the conversation. His reaction is more problematic. He's making it about her pushing him, but he's not compromising. She even offered to switch, which he refused. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether her action was unreasonable. Choosing a male masseuse isn't inherently wrong. His discomfort is his issue, not hers. She's not forcing him to do anything; she just wants to go. If he wants to cancel, that's his choice, but she's not wrong for booking based on available options.\n\nSo the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. The key points are her attempt to understand, offering to switch, and his own rigid stance. She acted respectfully and tried to accommodate, so no fault there.\n"
