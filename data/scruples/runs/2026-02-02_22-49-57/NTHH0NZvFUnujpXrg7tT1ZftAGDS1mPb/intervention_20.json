A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author, a woman, and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. They had the option of male or female masseurs. She booked her boyfriend (male, 21) with the male masseur and herself with the female. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning, but he calls her arguments irrational and says she's making it up. The author even offers to switch masseuses, but he says to cancel and calls it too much trouble. She decides to go without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break it down. The key points are: the author made a choice based on the available options, the boyfriend has a personal boundary about male masseurs, there's a disagreement in perspective (therapeutic vs. sexual), and the boyfriend's reaction seems to escalate the situation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was trying to be fair by splitting the genders, assuming that the opposite sex would be okay. But the boyfriend has a different view, seeing all massages as sexual, which makes him uncomfortable with a male masseur. The author tried to understand his reasoning, which is reasonable, but he dismissed her and was inflexible. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made a choice that she thought was neutral, but the boyfriend has a personal boundary. The author's intention was to book a massage, and when the boyfriend expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. However, the boyfriend's response was to cancel, which suggests he's not open to compromise. \n\nIn such cases, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author didn't force him to do anything; she just made a booking choice. The issue arises when the boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and confrontational. The author's attempt to understand and adjust shows she's trying to be considerate, but the boyfriend's rigidity and accusations of irrationality might indicate his own issues with the topic. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for making a decision based on her understanding and for trying to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's discomfort is his personal choice, but his response seems to overreact and not engage in good-faith discussion. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
