A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse while they get a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable, saying massages are inherently sexual, and the author tried to understand his reasoning. The boyfriend then says to cancel his massage and the author proceeds to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author made a choice based on the available options, assigning each partner to a same-sex masseuse. The boyfriend objects, not just about the male masseuse but about massages being sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion, but the boyfriend shut it down and refused to proceed unless they cancel. The author then goes ahead without him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate this. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author's initial action was to book the massages, possibly assuming that same-sex assignments were standard or neutral. However, the boyfriend has a strong objection that he hasn't mentioned before. The author tried to understand his perspective, which is good. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems inflexible, dismissing the author's need for understanding and making a demand to cancel instead of finding a compromise. \n\nThe author offered to switch masseuses, which shows willingness to accommodate. But the boyfriend's reaction is more about not wanting to engage and not being open to negotiation. The author then decides to proceed without him, which is their right if they're not being unreasonable. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's initial decision was unreasonable. Since massages are generally considered therapeutic, the author's approach was standard. The boyfriend's discomfort is personal and not commonly shared, but it's his issue. The author didn't force the choice; they offered a compromise. Since the boyfriend refused to budge, the author's decision to go ahead without him isn't wrong. They respected his objection but also maintained their own stance. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted reasonably, tried to understand, and offered solutions. The boyfriend's rigid response is the main issue here.\n"
