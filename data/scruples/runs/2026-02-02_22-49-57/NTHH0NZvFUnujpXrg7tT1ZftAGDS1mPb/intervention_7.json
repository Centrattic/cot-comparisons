  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a massage with a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The writer tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer chose based on available options, maybe thinking it was fair to split the genders. The boyfriend's objection is about the sexual connotation he assigns to massages. The writer's intention was to plan the activity together, so when he objects, she tries to understand his perspective. She even offers to switch, showing flexibility.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and mutual comfort. The writer didn't force him into anything; she made a choice but was open to adjusting it. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the writer was trying to accommodate his feelings. The argument arises because he's not just uncomfortable but refuses to switch, leading to cancellation. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, she made a choice that the other person wasn't okay with, but she tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's stance seems rigid, but the writer's actions were not malicious. She wanted to understand and compromise. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to respect his feelings after initial scheduling. The answer might be B (No).\n"
