A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a decision based on their own view that massages are therapeutic, and they wanted to book a male masseuse for their boyfriend. The boyfriend, however, has a different perspective, feeling that massages are sexual and thus uncomfortable with a male masseuse. \n\nThe author's intention was to make plans for both of them, but they didn't consider the boyfriend's feelings beforehand. Maybe they should have discussed it more before booking. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid; if someone feels that a situation is making them uncomfortable, their feelings should be respected. But the author tried to offer a compromise by switching masseuses, which the boyfriend rejected. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for each other's boundaries. The author might argue they were trying to understand, but the boyfriend felt the situation was non-negotiable. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and suggesting cancellation could be seen as dismissive of the author's effort to accommodate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be in the right because they were trying to understand and offer solutions. However, the initial decision to book without considering the boyfriend's possible discomfort could be a point against them. But since the boyfriend has a clear boundary, the author isn't violating any major issue here. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
