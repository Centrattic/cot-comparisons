A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend is upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't let a man do it. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a choice based on available options, maybe assuming that matching by gender was standard. But her boyfriend has a strong objection. He finds it sexual, which the author disagrees with. He even says she's wrong and making it up to argue. The author tried to switch, but he insisted on canceling. Now she's going without him.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? Well, the author didn't force him to get a male masseuse. She tried to accommodate his preferences by offering to switch. The boyfriend is refusing to compromise and is being dismissive of her attempt to understand. His reaction seems extreme, possibly because he's uncomfortable discussing the issue or has a different view on massages. The author is trying to communicate and find a solution, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have asked his preference before booking. But in the scenario, it's implied that they were planning to go together, so maybe it's common to book together. But the male masseuse part was her choice. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels that way. The author isn't forcing him to get a massage, just choosing the masseuse. But he's refusing to go at all rather than compromising. His stance seems rigid. \n\nThe author is in a monogamous relationship, so maybe he's okay with women masseuses because it's different. But he's not open to discussion. The author's intent was to understand, not to push. He's calling her argumentative when she's just trying to debate the reasoning. That's a problem. The author's actions are reasonable, trying to resolve the issue, while the boyfriend's refusal to adjust and his harsh response contribute to the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
