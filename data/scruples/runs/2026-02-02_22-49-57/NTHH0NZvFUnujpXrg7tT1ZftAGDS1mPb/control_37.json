A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse when he said he's uncomfortable with that. So the situation is, they both wanted to get massages together. The author picked a male for the boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseuse. The author is trying to understand his reasoning, maybe even see if they can debate it, and offers to switch. But the boyfriend says to cancel and the author decides to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort. The boyfriend clearly stated he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, so the author should have respected that. Maybe they didn't realize he was that strict about it. But the author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered a solution. However, the boyfriend reacted strongly, suggesting he might not be open to discussion. The author then insists on going, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought the choice was neutral, seeing massages as therapeutic. They didn't mean to push an argument but to understand. The boyfriend's response of canceling could be seen as avoiding the situation, but if he's really that uncomfortable, maybe the author should have backed off instead of trying to debate it. The key point is whether the author should have respected the boyfriend's preference without trying to argue. Since the boyfriend's discomfort is real, even if his reasoning is flawed, the author's insistence on understanding and debate might have been the wrong approach. So the answer might be AITA in the author's favor or not. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). I think the author is not in the wrong because they tried to accommodate and understand, but maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. However, the author could have considered the boyfriend's feelings more and not made it a debate. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The main thing is that the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and the author should have respected that immediately. So perhaps the author is at fault for not just canceling or switching without arguing. But the boyfriend's response of canceling might also be extreme. I need to decide based on the options given. The correct answer is probably B, no, the author isn't in the wrong, because they made an effort to understand and offer a compromise. However, maybe the initial action was a mistake, but the author tried to fix it. So the answer is B.\n"
