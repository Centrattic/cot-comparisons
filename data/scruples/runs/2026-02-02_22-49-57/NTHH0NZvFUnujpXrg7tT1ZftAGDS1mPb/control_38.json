  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who booked massages for her boyfriend and herself. She assigned him to a male masseuse and herself to a female one. The boyfriend then says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and gets into a discussion about his reasoning. He says she's being argumentative and claims she's wrong. She offers to switch masseuses, but he says to cancel his appointment. She's going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's action was to book the massages. She might have thought it was fair or logical to assign based on gender. But the boyfriend has a personal boundary he's not comfortable with. He's saying that because he sees massages as sexual, he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. \n\nIs the author wrong for initially assigning him to a male masseuse? Well, she might not have known his feelings beforehand. But when he expresses discomfort, she tries to understand and offers to switch. That seems like she's trying to accommodate him. However, he refuses to switch and wants to cancel. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting personal boundaries and the initial decision. The author didn't force him to do anything; she just made a booking decision. When he voiced his discomfort, she tried to adjust. But he was inflexible and even said she was being irrational. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The boyfriend's issue is with the gender of the masseuse, which is a personal preference. The author made a choice without knowing his preference, but upon learning, tried to adapt. The boyfriend's reaction of refusing to switch and canceling might be seen as the problem here. \n\nBut was the initial booking wrong? If she knew he had a preference, she might have chosen differently. Since she didn't know, maybe it's not her fault. However, some might argue that it's better to ask before making such decisions. But others might say that the boyfriend should be more open-minded about his beliefs regarding massages. \n\nThe author tried to discuss and compromise, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and labeling her as argumentative might be his fault. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to understand and adjust. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
