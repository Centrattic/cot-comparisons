A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who later says he's uncomfortable with a man massaging him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he accused her of being irrational and turning it into an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a decision based on the available options, thinking it was a 50-50 split. She tried to be open to his feelings and even offered to switch masseuses. The boyfriend, however, is uncomfortable with the male masseuse and sees the situation as sexual, which the author disagrees with. \n\nIs the author wrong for making the choice she did? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's possible that she didn't realize he had such a strong opinion. However, when he expressed his discomfort, she tried to accommodate him. He then reacted negatively, saying to cancel the massage and not going. The author still went without him. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting each other's boundaries and communication. The author might not be in the wrong because she tried to understand and adjust. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her efforts. The question is whether the author overstepped by initially choosing a male masseuse without knowing his preference. But since she didn't know, maybe that's not her fault. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to fix it. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. \n\nSo, based on the options, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because she made an effort to accommodate his feelings after he expressed them, and the conflict seems to stem from his discomfort rather than her initial choice being inherently wrong.\n"
