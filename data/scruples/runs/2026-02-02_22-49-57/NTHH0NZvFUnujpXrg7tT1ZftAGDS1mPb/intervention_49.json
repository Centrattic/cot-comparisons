A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about whether the author is at fault for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They both planned to get massages together, and she chose a male for him and a female for herself. He gets upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a man massaging him. They argue, and he ends up not going. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably thought it was a fair split since there were options for both genders. She might have assumed that gender wasn't an issue for him. But then he has a strong reaction, saying it's sexual, which is different from her view that it's therapeutic. \n\nShe tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication. Did she overstep by making the choice without considering his feelings? Or is he being unreasonable by not allowing it? \n\nMassages can be a personal thing, and some people might feel uncomfortable with the gender of the therapist. But since they were going together, maybe she should have checked with him before booking. However, she might not have known he felt that strongly. It's possible that she was trying to be accommodating by splitting the genders but didn't realize his deep discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, he could have communicated his preferences earlier. She tried to discuss it and understand, but he dismissed her efforts, calling her irrational. That might be his fault for not being open to her perspective. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? If she made a decision without considering his possible discomfort, that's a problem. But if she genuinely didn't know and tried to resolve it, maybe not. The fact that he refused to switch and canceled might mean he's not being flexible. \n\nI think the main issue is that she didn't check his preferences beforehand. But since they were going together, maybe she assumed it was okay. However, respecting his boundaries is important. If he has a valid reason for discomfort, she should consider that. But in this case, his reasoning is that massages are inherently sexual, which might be a personal belief. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she tried to understand and even offered to switch. He was the one who refused without resolution. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
