A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They both wanted massages together, and the author chose male for him and female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he says he won't go with the male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She still plans to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are consent, comfort, and mutual respect. The boyfriend is expressing discomfort with a male masseuse, which he associates with the massage being sexual. The author, on the other hand, believes massages are therapeutic. She didn't force him to book; she made a choice based on the available options. When he objects, she attempts to compromise by offering to switch. But he insists on canceling, and she goes ahead anyway.\n\nThe boyfriend's issue seems to be personal discomfort, not a violation of any agreement. The author tried to communicate and find a solution. By offering to switch, she shows she's willing to accommodate his feelings. However, he's not open to that and instead wants to cancel. The author then decides to proceed without him, which is her right. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she respected his initial decision by offering alternatives. The boyfriend's stance is about his own comfort, not hers. She didn't push him to go with the male masseuse against his will. Her desire to understand the reasoning is valid because it's a debate about personal beliefs. The fact that he labeled her opinion as irrational and refused to find a middle ground might be more problematic. But the main question is about the act of scheduling him with the male masseuse. Since she provided options and he declined, she's not at fault here. So, answer B.\n"
