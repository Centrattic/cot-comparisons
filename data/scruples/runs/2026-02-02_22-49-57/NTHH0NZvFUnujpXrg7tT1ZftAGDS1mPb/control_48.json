A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend, a man, with a male masseuse for a couples massage. She thought it was a simple choice between male and female masseuses, so she picked the male one for him and the female for herself. But when she told him, he's really upset and says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She argues that massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he accuses her of being irrational and pushing something he's uncomfortable with. She even offered to switch, but he said to cancel his massage. She's going ahead without him.\n\nHmm. First, maybe the author didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings about the situation. Massages can have different connotations for people. Some might see them as therapeutic, others might have different associations. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, maybe it's because of his own personal boundaries or past experiences. The author might have thought splitting the masseuses by gender was neutral, but the issue here is that the boyfriend specifically doesn't want a male masseuse. She did offer to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate him, but he refused to go at all. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not knowing his preference beforehand? She asked about availability and made a choice, but maybe she should have discussed it with him first. Since it's a couples' massage, maybe they should have both agreed on the gender of the masseuse. The boyfriend's discomfort is significant enough that he's canceling the massage, which might be his choice, but the author's initial decision to book without consulting him could be the root of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wanted to make the arrangement and tried to be accommodating. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. If massages are inherently sexual to him, maybe that's a personal belief, but it's his right to have boundaries. The author might have overstepped by making a decision that affects his comfort. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? It's possible because she didn't check with him about his preferences, especially since he's the one who would be directly affected. Even though she offered to switch later, the fact that she booked without his input might mean she's partly at fault. However, it's also his choice to refuse the male masseuse regardless of her actions. The question is whether scheduling without discussing is wrong. \n\nI think the key point is that she made the decision without his input. Even if she thought it was a simple choice, he had a strong reaction. She might not be entirely wrong because she tried to adjust, but she could have been more proactive in understanding his preferences beforehand. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she tried to resolve it, but there's a nuance here. Wait, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If she didn't check his preference, maybe she's at fault. But the answer options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nAlternatively, since he refused to go after she offered to switch, maybe the issue isn't her. But the initial booking was her decision. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue, but if she didn't consider his feelings, she's partially responsible. I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to accommodate him after the fact and he was the one who canceled. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. \n\nThe author scheduled the male masseuse for him, which he refused. She tried to understand, offered to switch, he still refused. She's going without him. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't consider his feelings beforehand but tried to fix it, maybe she isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
