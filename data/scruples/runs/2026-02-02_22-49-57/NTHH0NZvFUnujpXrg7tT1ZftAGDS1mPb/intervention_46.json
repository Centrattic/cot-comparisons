  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She thought massages are therapeutic, while he feels they're inherently sexual and refused. She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he didn't want to and canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman's intention seems genuine; she wanted to plan a shared activity, maybe to bond. She didn't know his discomfort beforehand. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a valid personal boundary. Massages can be intimate, and some people might feel uncomfortable, especially if they're in a monogamous relationship and might feel that the interaction with someone of the opposite sex is an issue.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The woman tried to explain her perspective and offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate his feelings. However, the boyfriend's refusal and insistence on canceling might be seen as dismissive of her efforts. But the main question is whether the woman was wrong to book him with a male masseuse in the first place without knowing his preference.\n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she had no prior knowledge of his discomfort. It's a common situation where people have different comfort levels. She made an effort to adjust, so her initial decision isn't malicious. However, there's a nuance here. If the boyfriend had communicated his preference before, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But since he didn't, the woman isn't at fault for making a choice based on available information. The answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
