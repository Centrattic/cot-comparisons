Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell their mom that her cooking habits contribute to their weight, but the mom blames them for not having self-control. The author feels they need support from their mom but aren't getting it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and living at home. They're struggling with weight and trying to make changes. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might not be helpful, as the author has admitted they can't control themselves when food is present. The mom's own obesity might indicate she has similar issues, but she's not taking responsibility. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling their mom's actions are part of the problem? Probably not. They're trying to communicate their needs. The mom isn't helping, which is a separate issue. The author isn't forcing the mom to cook that way; they're asking for support. So the author isn't wrong for wanting help. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, considering the age, the author is still young and dealing with health issues. It's reasonable for them to seek support from family. The fact that the mom isn't providing that support doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their feelings. The author is taking steps on their own, which is positive. The question is whether they're at fault, and given the situation, they're not. The mom's lack of support is her issue. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
