Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI around 40 and lives with their mom, who is also obese. The author feels that their mom is overfeeding them with large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which they can't resist. They've tried to talk to their mom about it, but she tells them they don't have to eat it. The author feels that their mom is partly responsible for their weight and that she's not helping them, just blaming them.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their own health. They're aware of their BMI and want to make changes. They've communicated their concerns to their mom, which is a good step. The mom's response is to say they don't have to eat it, which is dismissive and not helpful. The author is frustrated that their mom isn't supportive and even blames them. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is taking initiative to improve their health and is seeking support from their mom, which isn't being provided. The mom's response is not helpful, and the author feels unsupported. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to manage their weight and asking for help. The mom's behavior might be contributing to the problem, but the author is trying to take responsibility for their own health.\n\nThe author is 18 and still living with their mom. It's reasonable for them to want their mom's support, especially since she's the one cooking and buying food. The author isn't blaming their mom entirely but is acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking help and are aware of the issue. The mom is the one not being supportive, but that doesn't make the author wrong for trying to address their health.\n"
