Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom being overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is trying to address this by talking to their mom, but the mom isn't supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. They have a BMI of around 40, which is considered obese. They mention that they want to lose weight and have tried to discuss this with their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which isn't helpful. The author feels their mom contributes to their weight because of large portions and buying unhealthy food. The mom, on the other hand, doesn't take the issue seriously and blames the author for not controlling themselves.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider if the author's approach is reasonable. They are asking for help from their mom, who is responsible for cooking. Their mom's response seems dismissive and not supportive. The author isn't to blame for their weight because they are struggling with self-control and have a family member whose habits contribute to the problem. The mom's insistence that the author just needs to avoid eating what's served isn't helpful, especially given the author's stated inability to control themselves.\n\nThe author's intent is to seek support, which is a valid request. They are not forcing their mom to act a certain way but are asking for help. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her role in the situation might be the issue here. The author isn't the one causing the problem; they're trying to address it with the resources they have. Moving out is a future plan, but until then, they need support. The mom's response is not enabling them in a healthy way.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to take steps to improve their health and have communicated their needs. The problem seems to stem from the mom's lack of support, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
