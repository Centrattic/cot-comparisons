Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom who is also obese, and they feel like the mom's large portions and buying lots of unhealthy food contribute to their weight. The mom's response is that they don't have to eat it, but the author struggles with self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong here. The author is trying to address their own health by managing their diet, but the environment they're in (with their mom's cooking habits) is making it hard. The mom isn't supportive, which complicates things.\n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom entirely, just pointing out that the mom's habits make it difficult. They're trying to take steps themselves and plan to move out. The mom's response is dismissive, not helpful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to take initiative to improve their health. It's reasonable to ask for support from a family member, especially when they're the one cooking. The mom isn't helping, which is part of the problem. The author isn't wrong for seeking that support or for pointing out the environmental factors affecting their diet.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're aware of their own issues and trying to work on them, while the mom isn't being supportive. The situation is complex, but the author's intentions are positive.\n"
