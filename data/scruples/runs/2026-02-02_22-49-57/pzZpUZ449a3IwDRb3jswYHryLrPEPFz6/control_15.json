Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the son (18 years old) is obese and lives with his mother, who is also obese. He feels his mom is overfeeding him with big portions and buying a lot of chocolate. He's tried talking to her about it, but she responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" and doesn't support his efforts to lose weight. He's frustrated and feels she's partly responsible for his weight, but she blames him and refuses to help.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the son) is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and boundaries. The son is seeking help from his mother to manage his eating habits because he struggles with self-control. His mother's response is not supportive, and she doesn't change her behavior despite his requests. \n\nIs it wrong for the son to feel that his mother's actions are contributing to his obesity? The son is trying to take responsibility by acknowledging his own issues with self-control, but he also needs support. The mother isn't providing that support, which complicates things. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, the son is in a challenging situation. He's trying to make healthy choices but is in an environment that isn't facilitating those choices. The mother's refusal to adjust portion sizes or reduce unhealthy snacks could be making it harder for him. However, does that make her actions wrong? It's a matter of perspective. The mother may not see her behavior as harmful, while the son feels it is.\n\nThe son isn't directly causing harm; he's expressing his needs and the challenges he faces. He's not bullying his mother or forcing her to change, just asking for her support. The mother's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. In such cases, the responsibility isn't entirely on the son. He's trying to take action, but the environment isn't supportive. \n\nConsidering that the son is 18 and still living at home, it's reasonable for him to seek a supportive environment. However, he also needs to take personal responsibility for his actions. But given the scenario, the mother isn't helping, so the son isn't in the wrong for seeking her assistance. The mother's lack of support is the issue here, not the son's desire for help. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The son is justified in feeling that his mother's actions are contributing to his weight issues and is rightfully seeking support, which she isn't providing.\n"
