Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (an 18-year-old) living with their mother, both being obese, and the mother making large portions and buying unhealthy food, which the author can't resist. The author tried to talk to their mom about this, but the mom keeps deflecting by saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated when the mom doesn't support their efforts to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is an adult living with their parent, which is common for 18-year-olds. However, being obese and wanting to lose weight is a personal health goal. The mother's behavior\u2014making big portions and buying unhealthy snacks\u2014could be contributing to the author's struggle. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but the mother isn't responding supportively. \n\nThe key points are: the author is seeking help, the mother isn't providing the support needed, and the author feels blamed when they try to address the issue. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive, especially since the author has admitted they can't help themselves once the food is there. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take control of their health. They're communicating their struggles, which is a responsible step. The mother's lack of support or understanding is the issue here. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is pointing out that the environment (large portions, availability of unhealthy food) is contributing to their problem. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should take more personal responsibility. But given their age and the shared living situation, expecting them to handle everything alone without support might be unrealistic. The mother's age and her own weight issues might make her less motivated to change, but that doesn't negate the author's valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything wrong by expressing their needs. The mother isn't helping, but the author isn't at fault for that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. Since the author is trying to address a health issue and the mother isn't cooperating, the author's frustration is justified. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are seeking help and trying to improve their health, which is a positive step. The mother's behavior is the problem, not the author's desire to lose weight or their communication about it.\n"
