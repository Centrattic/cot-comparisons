Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom being overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and has a BMI around 40. They mention that they can't control their eating when there's a lot of food around, and their mom gives the same response each time: \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author tried to talk to their mom about her role in their weight, but she blames them and refuses to change, even when the author suggests they both lose weight. The mom says it doesn't matter for her because of her age.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's health, their attempts to address the situation, and their mom's responses. The author is trying to take control of their health, which is a personal responsibility. However, the mom's behavior\u2014making large portions and buying lots of high-calorie snacks\u2014might be enabling the author's struggle with overeating. The author is not taking responsibility for their own actions, maybe, but they're also in a situation where they can't control what their mom serves. The mom's dismissive attitude (\"you don't have to eat it\") could be counterproductive, as the author has admitted they can't control themselves in that environment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author is trying to address their health, which is commendable. They've communicated their needs to their mom without success. The mom, on the other hand, isn't supporting them and instead shifts the blame. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're seeking help in a situation where the environment is contributing to their problem. However, they might have some responsibility in managing their own eating habits, but given their mom's role in creating the environment (large portions, availability of snacks), the blame isn't solely on the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying their best in a challenging situation where their mom isn't providing the support they need. The mom's actions are contributing to the problem, and the author is rightly seeking help but isn't getting it. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
