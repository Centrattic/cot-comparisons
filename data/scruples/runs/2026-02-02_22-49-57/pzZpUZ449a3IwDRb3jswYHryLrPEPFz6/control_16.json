Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is 18, still living with their mom, and trying to lose weight. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. When the author asks her to stop, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is obese and wants to lose weight. They are trying to take responsibility by talking to their mom. The mom is also obese, and the author is trying to get her help. The mom's response is dismissive, telling the author it's their choice not to eat. But the author feels that the mom's actions (big portions, buying chocolate) are making it harder for them to control their eating. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, the author is trying to address a personal health issue and is seeking support from their mom. The mom's response isn't supportive. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely, but they are asking for help. The mom's age is given as X, and she's not motivated to change, which the author has to accept. The author is taking steps on their own, which is good. \n\nThe key points are: the author is trying to manage their health, the mom isn't providing the support they need, and the author is not being blamed for their weight in a self-deprecating way. Instead, they're looking for external help. The author's actions seem reasonable. The mom's response is not helpful, but the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out and seeking assistance. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are taking steps to improve their health and are not blaming their mom in a cruel way. They're asking for support, which is a valid request. The mom's lack of support is the issue here, not the author's approach.\n"
