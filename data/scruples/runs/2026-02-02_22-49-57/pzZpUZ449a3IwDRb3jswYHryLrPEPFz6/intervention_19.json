Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who is also obese, and they're struggling with their mom's large portions and her refusal to help. The author feels their mom is contributing to their weight and has tried to communicate this, but the mom is defensive and doesn't support them. The author is considering moving out to lose weight and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the situation. They've discussed their issues with their mom but feel she's not supportive. The mom's responses are dismissive, using \"you don't have to eat it,\" which isn't helpful. The author is seeking help, which is reasonable.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, it's common for individuals to resist feedback that makes them feel responsible for another's issues. The mom's reaction of blaming the author might stem from her own discomfort or inability to change her behavior. The author is in a vulnerable position, trying to manage their health in an environment that's not supportive. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. They're trying to address a problem that affects their health. The mom's response is not supportive, so the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong. They might need to find other ways to manage their diet, like preparing their own meals, but that's a different issue. The main point is that the author's intentions and communication are valid, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
