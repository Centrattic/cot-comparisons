Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom making large portions and buying unhealthy food, which the author feels is contributing to their obesity. The author has tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and even blames them. The author is 18 and still living at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but still living with their mom. They're struggling with their weight and trying to make healthier choices. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might seem dismissive. But is the author in the wrong for feeling that way?\n\nWell, the author isn't doing anything wrong by expressing their concerns. They're trying to take steps to improve their health and have communicated their needs to their mom. The mom's response is the issue here, not the author's attempt to address the problem. The author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're asking for support. The mom's age isn't a valid excuse for not supporting her child's health goals, even if she doesn't have the same priorities.\n\nAlso, the author's self-awareness is key. They recognize their problem with overeating and are taking steps to manage it. They're not blaming the mom entirely but are seeking help. The mom's lack of cooperation is the main conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to get their mom to help them. The responsibility lies with the mom to provide a supportive environment, especially since she's the one cooking and buying the food.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
