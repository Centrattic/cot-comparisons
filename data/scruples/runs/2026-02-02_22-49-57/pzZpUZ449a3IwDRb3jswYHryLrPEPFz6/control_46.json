Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who also cooks a lot. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they try to talk to her about it, she responds with \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and that she's not helping them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18), but still living with their mom. They have a clear health issue and want to lose weight. The mom's behavior includes large portions and buying unhealthy food, which the author finds difficult to resist. The author is trying to communicate their needs but feels dismissed by the mom.\n\nThe key points are: the author is making a genuine effort to address their health, they're expressing their needs to their mom, but the mom isn't supportive. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is seeking support. The mom's response is dismissive and not helpful. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, when someone is struggling with self-control, especially with eating, having a supportive environment is crucial. If the environment (in this case, the mom's cooking habits) is contributing to the problem, it's reasonable for the author to feel that support is needed. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be well-intentioned but doesn't address the author's struggle with self-control. It's like saying, \"It's up to you,\" which might not help someone with an addiction or compulsion.\n\nThe author isn't in a position to force their mom to change her habits, but they are right to seek support. The mom's lack of support could be due to various reasons\u2014maybe she's also struggling with her own weight, or she doesn't see the issue. However, the author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their health and trying to communicate that need. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to take responsibility for their health and have a valid concern about their environment. The mom's lack of support is part of the problem here, but the author's position is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
