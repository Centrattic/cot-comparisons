Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and has tried to talk to her about portion sizes and the chocolate. The mom's responses are dismissive, saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author suggests they both lose weight, the mom says her age makes it irrelevant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to take control of their health, which is a personal responsibility. However, living with someone else, especially a parent, can complicate things because the parent's habits affect the environment. The author isn't forcing their mom to cook or buy chocolate; they're asking for support. The mom, on the other hand, isn't being supportive and is dismissing the author's concerns. \n\nThe author's BMI is around 40, which is in the obese category, so their health is a valid concern. They've communicated their needs clearly but are met with resistance. The key here is that the author is seeking help and is not at fault for wanting to improve their health. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author isn't wrong for expressing their needs.\n\nI should also consider if the author is taking any responsibility. They acknowledge their own struggle with self-control but are asking for assistance. The fact that they're trying to make changes on their own shows initiative. The mom's refusal to engage in a supportive way is her issue, not the author's. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a valid health concern and have communicated their needs. The mom's lack of support is the problem here, not the author's request for help. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
