Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is 18, lives with their obese mother, and is struggling with obesity (BMI ~40). They feel their mom's large portions and buying unhealthy snacks contribute to their weight. They've tried talking to her calmly, but she dismisses them, saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The mom also refuses to consider losing weight, citing her age.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's health concerns and their attempts to communicate with their mom. The author isn't blaming the mom solely but acknowledges their own struggle with self-control. However, the mom isn't supportive, which makes it harder for the author to manage their diet. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors are the author's intent to improve their health and the mom's lack of support. The author is taking steps to address their weight, which is positive. They're also asking for help, which is reasonable. The mom's response is dismissive and unhelpful, which doesn't justify the author's actions. \n\nThe author isn't making excuses for their own behavior; they're seeking support. The situation here is complex. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. The mom's behavior is the issue here, as she's not acknowledging the impact of her actions on her child's health. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author is taking responsibility where they can and is seeking help, which is understandable. The mom's response is problematic, but the author isn't to blame for that.\n"
