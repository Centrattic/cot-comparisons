Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mother who's also obese. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell her that this isn't helping, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels like the mom isn't supporting them in their weight loss efforts and is even contributing to the problem.\n\nFirst, the author isn't in the wrong just for recognizing that their mother's habits might be making it harder for them to control their eating. It's reasonable for someone trying to lose weight to ask for support in their environment. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the author's struggle with self-control. The author is being honest about their challenges and is seeking help, which is a valid approach. The mom isn't taking their concerns seriously, which is a problem. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is acknowledging their need for help. Since the author is taking steps on their own and plans to move out to focus on losing weight, they aren't acting irresponsibly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
