Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mom, who is also obese. The author feels that their mom's habit of preparing large portions and buying lots of chocolate is contributing to their weight problem. They've tried to talk to their mom about it, but she just tells them not to eat it, and when the author blames her for being partly responsible, she blames them back.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong here. The author is trying to address their health by reducing food intake, but their mom's cooking habits are making it hard. The mom's response is dismissive, which might not be helpful. The author's frustration is understandable, given their health goals and the environment they're in.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're trying to improve their health. The mom's actions (big portions, buying lots of chocolate) might not be malicious, but they are creating an environment that's challenging for someone trying to diet. The author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they\u2019re just expressing their need for support. \n\nThe author's approach seems reasonable\u2014they've tried talking to their mom calmly and asked for help. The mom's response is problematic because she's not providing the support needed. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take control of their health and asking for help. Even though they're still living with their mom, that doesn't mean they should have to deal with these obstacles without any assistance.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they can't help themselves when there's a lot of food around, which is a common issue with overeating. The mom's advice to \"not eat it\" is simplistic and not helpful in a situation where self-control is difficult. The author is seeking a partner in health improvement, but the mom is resistant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a health issue and have been met with resistance from their mom. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
