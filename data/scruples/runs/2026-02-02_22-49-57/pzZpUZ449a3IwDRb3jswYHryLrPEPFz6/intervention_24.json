Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The story is about the author, who is 18, living with their mom, and struggling with obesity. They think their mom is overfeeding them by making huge portions and buying lots of chocolate. They try to talk to their mom, but she just says \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author asks for help, the mom blames them. The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated because their mom isn't supporting them in losing weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but maybe not fully independent yet, living at home. They have a BMI of around 40, which is in the obese category. They want to lose weight and are trying to address the home environment. The mom is also obese and perhaps not taking her own health as seriously. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is taking responsibility for their own health, which is a good sign. They're trying to communicate their needs, which is appropriate. However, the mom is not being supportive and is dismissing their concerns. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, when someone is trying to change their habits, especially in an environment that's not supportive, it's really hard. The author isn't blaming their mom entirely, but pointing out that the environment contributes. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the reality of the author's struggle with self-control. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has control over their own eating, the environment can play a role. The author is seeking support, which is a reasonable request. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings and trying to seek help. They're taking steps to improve their health, which is commendable. The problem lies with the mom's response, not the author's initial stance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
