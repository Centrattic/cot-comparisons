Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 years old and still living with their mom. They have a BMI around 40, which is considered obese. They mention that they want to lose weight and have started by focusing on diet. However, their mom, who is also obese, cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried to talk to their mom about this, saying it's hard to resist the food, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels like the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get her to help, but she's not willing, saying her age makes it irrelevant. The author is now trying to lose weight on their own but is considering moving out as a step towards that goal.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. The author is trying to address their health issue and has communicated their needs to their mom. The mom isn't providing the support they asked for and is making it harder with the large portions and availability of unhealthy food. The author is not blaming the mom for their entire weight problem, but acknowledging that the environment contributes. They are trying to take responsibility by saying they'll work on it once they move out, but they feel supported by the mom isn't helping.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is also dealing with her own health issues. She's not obligating the author to eat, just preparing food. The author's responsibility for their own choices is a factor here. But they do have a legitimate point that the environment is making it harder. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the struggle with self-control.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is not wrong for wanting to address their health and asking for support. The mom isn't necessarily wrong either, but she's not providing the help the author needs. The author is taking steps to improve, which is positive. The situation is more about differing perspectives and lack of support rather than clear fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
