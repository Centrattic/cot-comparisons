Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nSo the main points from the story: The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has mentioned their struggle with self-control, and when they ask the mom to help, she just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The mom also blames the author and isn't willing to address the weight issue herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's feelings and actions are justified. The author is trying to manage their weight and sees their mom's behavior as contributing to the problem. The mom isn't supportive and doesn't take the author's concerns seriously. The author is seeking help but isn't getting it, which is leading to frustration.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling that way? Well, they're trying to address a health issue. It's reasonable to feel that an environment with excessive food might hinder their efforts. The mom's responses are dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out a possible contributing factor. The mom's obesity might also be a clue that the household's eating habits aren't healthy for either of them.\n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. They're expressing their needs and trying to improve their health. The mom isn't in the right for not supporting them, but the author isn't at fault for wanting help. The key issue is the mom's lack of support, not the author's desire for assistance. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
