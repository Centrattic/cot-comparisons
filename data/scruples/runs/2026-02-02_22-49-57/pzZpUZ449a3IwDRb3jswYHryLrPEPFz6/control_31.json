Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and is trying to lose weight. The mom cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author has tried talking to their mom, but she blames them for not controlling their eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're trying to manage their weight and have a health issue (BMI ~40 is classified as obese). They're taking steps to address it, like focusing on food. The mom's response is dismissive, not supportive. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is pointing out that the environment (large portions and available snacks) isn't helping. They're asking for support, which is reasonable.\n\nNow, the mom's side: She's also obese, so maybe she's dealing with her own issues. Her response of \"you don't have to eat it\" suggests she might not see how her actions contribute to the problem. She might not be aware of how portion sizes or buying snacks affect her son's ability to control his eating, especially if he has a hard time resisting. She's also defensive and not offering help, which could make the author feel unsupported.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing their needs and seeking support, which is a reasonable thing to do. They're not shaming the mom for her habits but explaining how they hinder their own efforts. The author isn't taking full responsibility for their weight, but that's not necessary because health is multifaceted. The mom's responsibility here is to support the author's goals, especially since they live together. The author isn't wrong for wanting a supportive environment.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should take more personal responsibility. But they are trying to lose weight and have acknowledged their own struggle with self-control. They're not blaming the mom entirely but recognizing that the environment plays a role. Also, at 18, they're still in the process of forming healthy habits, and family support is crucial.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking support and pointing out how their mom's habits are making it harder for them. The mom's lack of support is the issue here. The author is taking steps to improve their health, which is commendable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
