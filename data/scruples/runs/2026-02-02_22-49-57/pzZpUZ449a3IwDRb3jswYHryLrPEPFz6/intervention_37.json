Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old living with their mother, who is also obese. The main issue is that the mother keeps making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author can't resist eating. The author tried to talk to the mother about it, but the mother blames the author for not eating the food and refuses to help with weight loss, citing her age as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with obesity and trying to take steps to improve their health. They've communicated their struggles to their mother, who is also a problem because of her cooking habits. The author is not at fault for wanting to take control of their health. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and not helpful. The author is seeking support, which the mother isn't providing, so the author is trying to find ways to cope on their own.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is taking responsibility for their health and trying to address the situation with their mother. They're not blaming her for their entire problem but are asking for help. The mother's behavior is contributing to the issue, but the author is trying to manage it. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable or cruel. They're just seeking support and understanding.\n\nI don't see any wrongdoing on the author's part. They're in a difficult situation and trying their best given the circumstances. The mother isn't providing the support needed, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take steps to improve their health. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
