Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and has tried to talk to her about the large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author struggles with self-control. The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address their health by making changes, which is a positive step. They've communicated their concerns to their mom, which is important. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering support. The author is seeking help but isn't getting it, which is frustrating. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're honest about their struggle and have approached the mom calmly. They're not blaming the mom entirely but pointing out how her actions (big portions, buying snacks) make it harder. The mom's refusal to consider change or support the author's goals might be a bigger issue. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're just expressing their needs. The mom isn't being helpful, so the author's frustration is valid. They're taking steps to improve their health despite the challenges, which shows responsibility. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to manage their health in a difficult situation where they need support but aren't getting it. The mom's lack of support is the main issue here, not the author's concern.\n"
