Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of junk food. The author is obese and feels like the mom's overfeeding contributes to their weight, but the mom blames them for not controlling themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is 18 and still living at home. They're trying to manage their weight, which is a significant health issue. The mom isn't helping by making big portions and buying chocolate, then telling the author they don't have to eat it. The author feels it's harder to resist when the environment is full of tempting food.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, they're trying to improve their health and have communicated their concerns. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is pointing out that the mom's actions make it harder. The mom's age is mentioned as a reason she doesn't need to change, but that's not relevant to the author's situation.\n\nThe key points are: the author is taking steps to address their health, they've asked for support from their mom, and the mom isn't providing that support. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking help. The mom's behavior (overfeeding and blaming the child) is problematic here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
