Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. They live with their mom, who also has weight issues. The mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, even when told not to. The author can't control themselves and eats it all, despite trying to lose weight. They tried to talk to their mom about it, but she blames them by saying they don't have to eat it. The author feels their mom is partly responsible and wants to lose weight once they move out.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, which is an adult, but still living at home. They have a BMI of around 40, which is morbidly obese. They mention trying to lose weight by starting with food. The mom's cooking habits are part of the problem, as she's making large portions and buying a lot of high-calorie snacks. The author has communicated this to their mom, but she responds by deflecting and not taking their concerns seriously.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and support. The author isn't wrong to want to lose weight and feel that their environment is making it harder. They've tried to address the issue directly but haven't received the support they need. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out that the mom's actions (or inactions) are contributing to the problem. It's reasonable for them to seek help from their family, especially since they live together. The mom's age isn't a valid excuse if she's aware of the issue and isn't helping. The author's plan to move out is a personal choice, but they're not wrong for wanting to improve their health. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
