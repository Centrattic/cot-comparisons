Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom who also cooks a lot and buys food like chocolate. The author tries to tell their mom that the large portions and availability of snacks contribute to their obesity. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author points out isn't helpful because they can't control themselves.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to take responsibility by saying they can't hold back and need help. They've even brought up the idea of both losing weight, but the mom dismisses it. The author feels unsupported and is moving out, planning to lose weight then. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to address their health and has communicated their needs to their mom. The mom isn't helping, which is frustrating. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but recognizes that the environment plays a role. It's reasonable for someone in their situation to seek support, especially when they've tried to communicate their struggles. The mom's responses seem dismissive and not helpful, so the author isn't the one at fault here. They're trying to make changes despite the challenges. So the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
