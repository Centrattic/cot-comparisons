Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being obese and living with their mother, who they feel is overfeeding them. They mention that their mother makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to stop, the mother responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels responsible for their own weight but wants support from their mom, who isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an 18-year-old adult living with their mother. The mother is also obese, which might indicate similar eating habits in the household. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but struggles with self-control, especially around the food the mother prepares. The mother's response is to tell the author that they can choose not to eat it, which the author finds unhelpful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's behavior is contributing to the environment that makes it hard for the author to control their eating. The author is trying to communicate their needs and is seeking support, which is reasonable. The mother isn't providing that support, but the author isn't forcing the mother to act a certain way. They're just expressing their feelings and trying to make changes. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is trying to address the situation constructively. The mother's response is dismissive, which is a problem, but the author isn't at fault here. They're taking responsibility by saying they know they need to eat less but need help. The mother's refusal to cooperate complicates things, but the author is doing what they can on their own. Since the author is still living with their mother and planning to move out, their situation isn't entirely within their control.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying their best given the circumstances and aren't making demands beyond what's reasonable. The mother's lack of support is the main issue here, not the author's actions.\n"
