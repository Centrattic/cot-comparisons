Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is 18, obese with a BMI of around 40, and lives with their mom. They mention that even though they want to lose weight, the mom keeps making big portions and buying chocolate. The author has tried to talk to her, saying she's partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them and says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels they need help from the mom but she's not supportive, and they plan to move out in four years to address the issue.\n\nFirst, the author is taking initiative to address their health. They've communicated their concerns to their mom, which is a responsible step. The mom's response seems dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to manage their weight, especially given their BMI. The mom might have a point about the author choosing to eat the food, but the author is struggling with self-control, which they've admitted to the mom. The mom's refusal to adjust portions or support the author's efforts could be seen as contributing to the problem. The author is not blaming the mom entirely but is seeking her help. Since the author is trying to make changes and has discussed it with the mom, who isn't providing the needed support, it seems the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B.\n"
