Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much.

Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it!

I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The mom also has weight issues. The author feels that their mother is overfeeding them and enabling bad habits by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. They've tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author is frustrated because they struggle with self-control and want help from their mother, but she doesn't seem to support them. Now, are they in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18), but still living with their mother. They have a BMI around 40, which is in the obese range. They mention that they can still walk and run without pain, so maybe not immediate health crises, but it's still a concern. The mom's response is to deflect responsibility, telling the author that they can choose not to eat the food. However, the author admits they can't control themselves when there's food around. \n\nThe key points here are responsibility and support. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight, which is a personal health goal. However, they are in a shared living environment where the mother's cooking habits may be making it harder. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might seem dismissive because it assumes the author has full control over their eating, which they don't. The author is asking for support, which is reasonable. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Not necessarily. They are seeking help in a situation where they acknowledge their own struggles with self-control. The mother's lack of support could be contributing to the problem. However, the author is an adult, so there's an expectation that they can take some responsibility for their own choices. But given that they have a known issue with self-control and the environment is enabling it, maybe the mother isn't entirely wrong in her actions either. \n\nBut the author's request for support is valid. Parents often help shape eating habits, and if the mother is aware that her child is struggling, she might need to adjust her behavior. The mother's response of blaming the child could be harmful. The author isn't blaming the mother for their obesity solely but is pointing out that the environment isn't helping. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author isn't wrong for wanting support and recognizing that their environment affects their health. The mother's lack of support isn't ideal, but the author is still responsible for their own actions. However, since they have a known inability to control their eating in that environment, it's reasonable for them to ask for changes. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking help in a challenging situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
