Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who is also obese. They mention that the mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author tries to talk to her about it, she just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get support but failed. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18) but still living with their mother. They have a health issue (obesity) and are trying to address it. The mom's behavior\u2014large portions and buying unhealthy snacks\u2014could be contributing factors. The author is asking for support, which the mom isn't providing, instead dismissing their concerns.\n\nNow, societal norms around family and health. Parents often have a role in their children's upbringing, even into adulthood. However, once a child is 18, they're legally adults. But in many cultures, especially in Europe, it's common for young adults to live with their parents. The mother might not realize that her behavior is enabling the author's overeating. The author is taking steps to address their health, which shows responsibility. The mother's refusal to help, despite being aware of the issue, could be seen as not supporting the author's efforts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're expressing concern about their health and the environment they're in. They're not blaming their mom without reason; they've tried to communicate their needs. The mom's response doesn't support the author's goals. The author isn't forcing the mom to change her habits, just asking for help. The mom's dismissal might be due to her own habits or denial about her health. The author's frustration is valid given the lack of support. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking assistance for a health issue and have tried to address it calmly. The mother's lack of support is the main issue, not the author's concerns.\n"
