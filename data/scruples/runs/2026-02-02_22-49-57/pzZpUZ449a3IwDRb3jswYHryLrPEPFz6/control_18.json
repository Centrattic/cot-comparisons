Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 18 years old, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mother who is also obese. The author is struggling with the mother's cooking habits, which involve large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The author has tried to communicate to the mother that these habits are contributing to their weight issues, but the mother responds with \"you don't have to eat it\" and blames the author for not being able to control themselves. The author is frustrated because they can't resist the food and feel unsupported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the environment they're in. It's common for people to seek support from family when making lifestyle changes. The mother's response doesn't acknowledge the author's struggle and instead shifts responsibility entirely onto them. Saying \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common phrase that doesn't take into account the author's lack of self-control in that situation. The mother might not realize how her actions (big portions, buying unhealthy snacks) make it harder for the author to manage their weight.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for expressing their needs. It's reasonable to ask a parent for support, especially when you're still living under their roof. The mother's refusal to consider making changes, even when offered a joint effort (like both trying to lose weight), is a problem. The author is taking steps on their own and planning to move out eventually, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, the author might be oversimplifying the issue by placing partial blame on the mother. While the mother's habits do contribute to the environment, the author's own choices play a role too. But given that the author has mentioned their inability to control themselves, it's a valid point. The mother's response is dismissive and not helpful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to address the situation. They're seeking help and are aware of their issue. The mother is not supporting them, which is the problem here. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
