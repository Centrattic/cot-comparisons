Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who is obese and lives with their mother. The mother cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author has tried talking to their mom about this, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and blames the author for not controlling their eating. The author is frustrated because they feel the mother isn't helping them with their weight loss goals.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about personal responsibility versus support from family. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight and has communicated their needs to their mother. However, the mother isn't adjusting her behavior, which makes it harder for the author. \n\nThe author isn't in a position where they can control their mother's actions directly. While they can choose what to eat, the environment set by their mother makes it challenging. The mother's refusal to adapt the home environment (portion sizes, availability of unhealthy snacks) could be seen as not supporting the author's health goals. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult (18 years old) and should have some autonomy in their choices. The mother's response that \"you don't have to eat it\" is technically true, but it doesn't address the underlying issue of the environment contributing to the problem. \n\nThe author is seeking support and making reasonable requests, which the mother isn't providing. The mother's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author isn't responsible for their mother's behavior, so it's not their fault that the mother isn't helping. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is a positive action, and the mother isn't aiding that. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
