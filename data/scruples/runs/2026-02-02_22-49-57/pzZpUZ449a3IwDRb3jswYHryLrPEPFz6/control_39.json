Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mom who also cooks large portions and buys unhealthy food. The author has tried to talk to their mom about changing the portions and food choices, but the mom keeps telling them they don't have to eat it. The author feels partly responsible for their weight because of their mom's actions and is now taking matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common parental response that might not address the underlying issue. The author is trying to communicate their struggles with self-control and seeking support, which is reasonable. The mom's refusal to help or consider change could be seen as not supportive. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is acknowledging they have a role in their own eating habits. They're taking steps to manage their health despite the environment. The key here is whether the author is wrong for wanting their mom to adjust her behavior to help them lose weight. Since the author is trying to improve their health and has communicated their needs, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's lack of support might be the issue here. So the answer is B (No).\n"
