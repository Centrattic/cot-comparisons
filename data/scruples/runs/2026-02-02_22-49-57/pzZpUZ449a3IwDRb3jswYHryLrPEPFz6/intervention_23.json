Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom also has a large portion size and buys a lot of chocolate, which they can't resist. The author tried to talk to their mom about this, but she responds with \"You don't have to eat it,\" even though the author knows they can't help themselves. The mom also refuses to take responsibility or consider losing weight together.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to seek help, not to accuse the mom of something malicious. They recognize their own struggle with overeating but feel that environmental factors (like large portions and available unhealthy food) are making it harder. The mom isn't being supportive, which is a common issue in families where health discussions can be sensitive. The author isn't blaming the mom directly but is pointing out the impact of her actions on their own health. Since the mom isn't willing to change, the author is left to manage on their own, which is understandable given their age and living situation. \n\nThe key points here are the author's age (18, so still young), their attempt to communicate, and the mom's unhelpful responses. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address their health concerns. The mom's behavior is more about lack of support, but the author isn't at fault for seeking help. So the answer should be B.\n"
