Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mother who also has weight issues. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they try to talk to her about it, she just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get support but their mom blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18), so they are legally an adult, but depending on cultural context, they might still be seen as a child. The mom is making food, which is a parent's role, but the portions and availability of unhealthy food might be contributing to the author's struggles. The author has mentioned their issues with self-control, so it's a combination of their own behavior and the environment provided by their mom.\n\nThe key points are whether the mom is overfeeding the author intentionally or is just enabling the situation. The author isn't saying the mom forces them to eat, but the presence of large portions and unhealthy snacks makes it hard for them to resist. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" shifts responsibility back to the author, which might be dismissive of their struggle. \n\nFrom a health perspective, being obese has serious implications, and the author is trying to take steps to improve. They're seeking help but not getting support. The question is if the author is in the wrong for pointing out the mom's role. It's important to consider that while the author has autonomy, the mom's actions (or inactions) do create an environment that's challenging for someone with self-control issues.\n\nHowever, the author is still living with their mom and might not have control over the household environment. It's a complex situation where both parties have roles. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to address the issue and seeking support. The mom's lack of cooperation is part of the problem, but the author is trying to manage their own health despite that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking steps on their own, which is positive. They're not blaming the mom entirely but acknowledging that the situation is part of the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them or for trying to address it. The answer would be B (No).\n"
