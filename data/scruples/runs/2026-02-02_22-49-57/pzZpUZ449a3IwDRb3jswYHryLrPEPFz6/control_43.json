Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person asking \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) is wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The scenario involves the author being obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mother who also has health issues. The author is struggling with self-control around food and has tried to communicate this to their mom, but she responds with \"You don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mother. They're trying to take control of their health by addressing their diet. The mother's response seems dismissive of the author's struggle with self-control. The key issue here is whether the mother is contributing to the problem by preparing large portions and buying unhealthy food, and if the author is justified in feeling that their mom isn't helping.\n\nThe author isn't blaming their mom for their entire weight issue but is acknowledging their own responsibility in eating the food. However, they're asking for support, which the mom isn't providing. The mother's age is brought up as a reason not to focus on her weight, but that doesn't address the author's need for a healthier environment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author must take personal responsibility for their choices, it's reasonable to seek a supportive environment. The mother's refusal to adjust her cooking and buying habits could be hindering the author's efforts. The author isn't wrong for wanting help; they're trying to improve their health and have communicated their needs. The mother's lack of support is a barrier here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns and seeking assistance. They're in a difficult situation where their health is at risk, and they're trying to navigate it as best as they can. The mother's response is unhelpful, and the author isn't entirely at fault for recognizing this and seeking change.\n"
