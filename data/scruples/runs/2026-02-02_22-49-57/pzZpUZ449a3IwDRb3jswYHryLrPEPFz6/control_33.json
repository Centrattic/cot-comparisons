Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 18-year-old who's obese and living with their mother. The mother cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. They've tried talking to their mom about the portions and the food, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels the mom is part of the problem and is blamed by the mom for their own weight.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're trying to take control of their health but are in a challenging environment. The mother's cooking habits and the availability of unhealthy food make it hard for the author to manage their eating. The author's request for support from their mother is met with deflection, which is frustrating.\n\nFrom the mother's side, she's likely trying to maintain her usual habits and might not see how her actions are contributing to the problem. Her response of \"you don't have to eat it\" could stem from a lack of awareness or maybe a way to avoid taking responsibility. However, her approach isn't helpful, and she's not providing the support the author needs.\n\nHealth-wise, obesity at a BMI of 40 is a serious issue. The author is taking steps to address it, which is positive. However, the environment they're in, with a mother who isn't supportive, complicates their efforts. The mother's age and focus on her own health might be a factor, but that doesn't excuse not helping the author.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to change their behavior, but the mother's role in creating an environment that facilitates overeating is a key point. The author isn't wrong for seeking help or pointing out that the environment is a factor. The mother's response is dismissive, which doesn't help the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue. They're in a tough spot where they need support and aren't getting it. The mother could do better by adjusting her habits to support the author's goals. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to take responsibility for their health and seeking support, which is reasonable.\n"
