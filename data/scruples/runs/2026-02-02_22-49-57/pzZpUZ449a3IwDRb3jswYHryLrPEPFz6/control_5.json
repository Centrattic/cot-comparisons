Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong (AITA). The author is 18 years old, obese, living with his mother who is also obese. He's trying to lose weight but feels his mom's overfeeding is making it hard. He's told her about his struggles, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and blames him. The author is frustrated because he can't control himself around the food, and he's trying to get her help.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is that his mom's cooking habits and buying large portions of food (like chocolate) are contributing to his obesity. He's trying to take control by eating less, but he finds it difficult. His mom, on the other hand, might not see that her actions are making it harder for him to control his eating. She's responding with a lack of support, which could be due to her own habits or maybe a lack of understanding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for thinking his mom is overfeeding him? Well, the key here is whether his mom's actions are genuinely overfeeding. Since she's making large portions and buying a lot of high-calorie snacks, that could indeed be contributing to his inability to manage his weight. The author is trying to communicate his needs, but his mom isn't providing the support he needs. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, when someone has a health issue like obesity, they might need a supportive environment. If the family environment is not helpful (e.g., no encouragement to choose healthier options, large portions), it can hinder their efforts. The author is trying to address this by asking his mom to help, but she's not cooperating. \n\nIs there a cultural context? The user mentions being from Europe, but the core issue is similar. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be a dismissive way of saying she's not responsible, but in reality, she's creating an environment that's hard for him to control.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. He's trying to address a real problem in his life and seeking support. His mom's lack of cooperation is part of the issue here. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). However, I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, is the author being too harsh on his mom? But given his efforts to communicate and her lack of response, it's reasonable for him to feel this way. So the answer is B.\n"
