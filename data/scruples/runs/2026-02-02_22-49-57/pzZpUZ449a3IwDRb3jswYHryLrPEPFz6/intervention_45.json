Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, and lives with their mom who is also obese. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell their mom to cut back, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get her to help with losing weight but she refused.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that they have a hard time controlling their eating when food is available, especially when it's in big portions. The mom's response is dismissive, not addressing the root issue. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. The mom's behavior\u2014large portions and buying unhealthy food\u2014might be contributing to the author's struggle. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their mom accountable. The key factors here are the author's age (18, an adult), the mom's role in providing food, and the author's own responsibility. Even though the author is an adult, living with family can complicate autonomy. The author is trying to make changes but feels the environment isn't helping. The mom isn't supportive, which the author is acknowledging. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mom solely but is asking for help. It's reasonable for them to express their needs, especially if the mom's habits are making the situation harder. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take steps to improve their health, even if moving out is the next step. The mom's refusal to engage or support the author's goals is the main issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're seeking support and trying to address a health issue, which is valid. The mom's lack of support and dismissiveness is the problem, not the author's desire to take control of their health.\n"
