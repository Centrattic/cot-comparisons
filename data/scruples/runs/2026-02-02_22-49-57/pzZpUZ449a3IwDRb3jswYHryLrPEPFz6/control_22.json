Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom who also has weight issues. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they ask her to stop, she says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blames them and doesn't support their efforts. Now the author is doing their own thing and plans to lose weight after moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is trying to make a healthy change but feels their mother's habits are making it difficult. They've communicated their concerns, but the mother isn't supportive. \n\nThe author's argument is that the mother's actions (large portions, buying unhealthy food) contribute to their obesity. The mother's response is dismissive, saying the author doesn't have to eat it. But the author admits they struggle with self-control, which is a personal challenge. However, the environment plays a role in eating habits. If the mother is enabling unhealthy eating by not adjusting the portions or the availability of unhealthy food, maybe she's contributing. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for holding their mother accountable? The author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is reasonable. They've communicated their needs, but the mother isn't cooperating. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is seeking support. Since the mother isn't providing that support, the author is trying to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the mother's actions might be part of the problem, the author is an adult (18) and should have some autonomy. However, living with family can complicate things. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue; they are seeking help and have communicated their needs. The mother's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to make a positive change and have tried to discuss it with their mother. The mother's lack of support is part of the problem, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to take responsibility for their health. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
