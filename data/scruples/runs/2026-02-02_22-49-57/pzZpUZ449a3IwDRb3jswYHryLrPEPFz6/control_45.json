Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and the mom also has weight issues. The author has tried to talk to their mom about portion sizes and the mom's habit of buying a lot of chocolate, but the mom keeps pushing back by saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has even tried to involve the mom in a weight loss plan, but the mom refuses to engage because of her age. Now the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult living with their mother. The mother's behavior\u2014making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate\u2014could be contributing to the author's overeating. The author has communicated their struggles but hasn't been met with the support they hoped for. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their mom accountable for her role in their weight issues.\n\nThe author is not wrong for wanting to address their own health. They\u2019re trying to take steps to improve, which is positive. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive and not helpful, especially since the author admits they can't control themselves around food. The mother's refusal to engage in a weight loss plan could be due to her own issues, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility in creating an environment that might trigger overeating.\n\nHowever, the author is an adult, so they have the autonomy to make their own choices. While the mother's actions might contribute, the author's overeating is a personal struggle. So is the author in the wrong for blaming their mom? Maybe not entirely. They\u2019re seeking support in a challenging situation. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially when it's clear they're struggling. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author isn't wrong for expressing their needs.\n\nOn the flip side, the author could be taking some responsibility for their own choices. Even if the mom makes large portions, the author has the choice not to eat them. But given their self-awareness about their inability to control eating when food is present, it's a valid struggle. The author isn't asking the mom to stop eating, just to create an environment that supports their goals. The mom's refusal to participate is a barrier.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong (B). They're trying to address their health and have communicated their needs, even if the mom isn't supporting them. The author's actions are reasonable, and the mom's dismissal is the issue here. The author isn't responsible for their mom's behavior, but they are trying to take control of their own situation.\n"
