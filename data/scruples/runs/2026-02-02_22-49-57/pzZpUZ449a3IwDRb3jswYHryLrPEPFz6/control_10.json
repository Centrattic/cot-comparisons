Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is an 18-year-old living with their mother, who is also obese. The user is struggling with their weight and has a BMI around 40, which is in the obese category. They mention that their mother makes huge portions and buys a lot of unhealthy food, like chocolate packs with 30 pieces. The user tries to tell their mom that her behavior contributes to their obesity, but the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The user feels like they need help from their mom but she's not providing it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The user is trying to address a problem that directly affects their health. They're not blaming their mom solely but are pointing out that her actions\u2014like making large portions and buying unhealthy food\u2014are contributing factors. The user has tried to communicate this calmly and kindly, but the mother isn't cooperating. The user wants support, which is reasonable, especially since they're still living at home.\n\nThe mother's responses seem dismissive. Telling someone \"you don't have to eat it\" when their environment is filled with tempting food isn't helpful. It's a bit of a cop-out because it ignores the reality of the user's struggle with self-control. The user is in a vulnerable position, needing support from a parent, but the mom is not providing the necessary help. The user's desire to lose weight is valid, and they're taking steps themselves, but they're also seeking assistance from their mother.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't wrong for wanting their mother to help create a healthier environment. It's reasonable for them to ask for support, especially when they've already communicated their needs. The mother's lack of support is the main issue here. The user isn't the at-fault party in this scenario.\n"
