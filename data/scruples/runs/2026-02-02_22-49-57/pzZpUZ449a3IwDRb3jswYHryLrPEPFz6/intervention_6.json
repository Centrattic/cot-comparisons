Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is at fault for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mother who is also obese. The mom makes large portions and buys lots of chocolate, then tells the author not to eat it. The author feels the mom is contributing to their weight issue and has tried to talk to her, but the mom blames them instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to manage their weight and has approached their mom for support, but the mom isn't helpful. The mom's response is dismissive, which is common in parent-child relationships where the parent might not see their role in the situation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address their health, especially since they're young and the mom's habits are making it hard for them to control their eating. \n\nThe key points are that the author is taking responsibility by trying to communicate their needs, while the mom isn't cooperating. Even though the author lives with their mom, they're not the one creating the environment that's making it hard to eat healthily. The author's frustration is valid because they can't control their mom's behavior, and they're seeking support. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her part is part of the problem here. \n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a lot of emphasis on personal responsibility for health, but in this case, the environment (created by the mom) is a significant factor. The author isn't in the wrong for recognizing that their environment is making it difficult to manage their weight. They're trying to address a problem that's partly out of their control. The mom's response is not supportive, which is a failure on her part. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is taking steps to improve their health and has communicated their needs, which is reasonable. The mom's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's desire for support.\n"
