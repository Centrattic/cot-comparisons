Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author is struggling to resist. The author is obese and trying to lose weight but feels their mom isn't helping by not adjusting the portions. The mom keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful because they can't control themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The author is an 18-year-old living with their mom. They've tried to communicate their needs but feel their mom isn't supporting them. The mom's response is dismissive, not acknowledging the author's struggle with self-control. The author is trying to take steps on their own but feels hindered by their environment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is making an effort to address their weight, which is a valid health concern. The mom's actions (large portions, buying unhealthy snacks) could be seen as contributing to the issue, especially if the author is honest about not being able to resist. The mom's refusal to consider joint efforts to lose weight might be part of the problem.\n\nHowever, the author is still living at home, so they might have limited control over their environment. They're not in the wrong for seeking support from their mom. The mom's dismissive attitude is probably the bigger issue here, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nThe author isn't forcing the mom to cook or buy certain things; they're asking for help. The mom isn't obliging, but the author is taking steps they can control. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support and trying to manage their condition. They're aware of their problem and are working on it as much as possible under the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
