Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, an 18-year-old living with their mom, who is also obese. The author is struggling with overeating and has a BMI around 40. They've tried to communicate with their mom about her cooking large portions and buying lots of chocolate, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get support, but the mom blames them and refuses to help. The author now wants to lose weight and plans to do so when they move out in four years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's attempts to communicate their needs and the mom's responses. The author is taking responsibility by acknowledging their own struggle with eating, but they're also pointing out the environment created by their mom's habits. The mom, on the other hand, isn't offering support, which could be contributing to the author's difficulty in managing their weight.\n\nThe author's goal is to improve their health, which is a valid and positive intention. They're not blaming their mom entirely but are seeking help, which they aren't receiving. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive and not helpful, especially when the author has already stated they can't help themselves. This lack of support from the mom might be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author is an adult (18), they're still living at home, so the mom's role in creating an environment conducive to healthy habits could be relevant. However, the author is also making an effort to change their own behavior, which shows they're not entirely depending on their mom. The author's frustration is understandable given the mom's lack of support.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a serious health issue and have communicated their needs. The mom's lack of support and dismissive attitude are the main issues here. The author's desire to take control of their health is valid, and their situation is a common challenge when trying to make lifestyle changes in an unsupportive environment. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
