Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese, lives with their mom who also has weight issues. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author has tried talking to her about it, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which doesn't help because the author can't control themselves.\n\nThe author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get help, but the mom dismisses them. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants to know what the answer is.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's attempts to communicate their problem, the mom's unhelpful responses, and the author's own efforts to manage their weight. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is expressing frustration with the environment contributing to their weight. The mom's behavior (large portions, buying chocolate) might be enabling the author's habits. The author is seeking support, which the mom isn't providing. \n\nThe question is whether the author's feelings and actions make them at fault. The author is trying to address their health, which is valid. The mom's responses are dismissive and unhelpful. The author isn't forcing the mom to do anything but is asking for support. Since the author's intent is to improve their health and they're taking steps despite the mom's lack of support, it's more about the mom not being supportive rather than the author being wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
