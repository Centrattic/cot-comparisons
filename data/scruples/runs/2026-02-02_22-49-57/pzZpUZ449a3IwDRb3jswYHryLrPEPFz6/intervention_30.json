Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a certain situation is in the wrong. The author is 18 and living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is obese and has tried to tell their mom that the big portions might be contributing to their weight, but the mom keeps telling them not to eat it all. The author feels the mom is partly responsible but the mom blames them. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is trying to address their obesity by changing their diet. Since they live with their mom, her cooking habits affect their environment. The author has communicated their issues, but the mom isn't supportive, making it hard for them to control their eating. The mom's response is dismissive, not helping. The author's request for help is met with resistance, and the mom prioritizes her own habits over the author's health.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has made an effort to communicate. They aren't forcing the mom to cook that way; they're asking for support. The mom's behavior might not be malicious but could be enabling the author's struggle. However, the author is an adult (18) and has some autonomy, even if they're still living at home. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common one, but the author is saying they can't help themselves, so the mom's refusal to adjust portions complicates their efforts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're trying to take steps to improve their health, which is commendable. They've informed the mom about their problem and asked for help. The mom isn't providing the necessary support, which is the mom's responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable. They might not be in the wrong for expressing their feelings, as they're seeking assistance in a healthy environment. The mother's age argument seems irrelevant if the author is trying to make a change. The author's plan to move out and manage their health then is a personal choice, but the current situation isn't their fault. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
