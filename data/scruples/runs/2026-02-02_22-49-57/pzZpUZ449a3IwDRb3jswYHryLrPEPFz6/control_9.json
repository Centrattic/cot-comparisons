Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mother. Both the author and their mother are obese. The author is trying to lose weight and has asked their mother to stop making large portions and buying chocolate, but the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mother is partly responsible for their weight and is upset because the mother won't help. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is an adult but still living with their mother. They\u2019re trying to take control of their health, which is a valid goal. The mother, however, isn't supportive and continues to make large portions and buy unhealthy snacks. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but the mother isn't receptive, which is causing conflict.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and support. The author isn't the one making the food; the mother does, and she's aware of the issue. The author is trying to get help to manage their eating habits, which is reasonable. The mother's response seems dismissive. Even if the mother isn't directly forcing the author to eat, the environment she creates (large portions and easy access to chocolate) makes it harder for the author to control their eating. The author's frustration is understandable because they're trying to take steps toward a healthier lifestyle but are facing obstacles from their living environment.\n\nI should consider if the author is overstepping. They are an adult and responsible for their own choices, but they\u2019re also seeking support from their parent. It's reasonable to ask for a supportive environment, especially when dealing with health issues. The mother's refusal to adjust portions, despite being aware of the problem, could be seen as not supporting the author's efforts. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is sharing a legitimate struggle.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might have her own reasons or limitations. Perhaps she's used to preparing large portions for herself, or she thinks she's helping by cooking. However, the author's primary issue is that their attempts to communicate their needs aren't being respected. The mother's repeated dismissal (\"you don't have to eat it\") ignores the author's self-control struggles. The author isn't the asshole for wanting help; the mother isn't supporting them as requested.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking help in a healthy direction and are being met with resistance. The answer should be B.\n"
