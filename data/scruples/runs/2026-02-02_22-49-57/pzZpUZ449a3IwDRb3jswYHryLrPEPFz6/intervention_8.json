Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI of ~40. They want to lose weight but feel their mom's overfeeding is part of the problem. The mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to cut back, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author tried to explain that they can't help themselves and need support, but the mom blames them and says she's too old to lose weight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're trying to manage their weight, which is a significant health issue. They're living with someone who contributes to their problem by preparing large portions and unhealthy snacks. The author is taking responsibility by wanting to make changes but feels unsupported. It's reasonable for them to ask for help from their mom, especially since they're still under 18 and dependent on her in terms of household meals.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might seem dismissive. However, it's possible she's not intentionally trying to hinder them. Maybe she doesn't realize the extent of the issue or feels unable to change her habits. Also, the mom is obese herself, so there could be family health patterns or her own struggles with weight that she's not addressing.\n\nBut the author isn't blaming the mom in a malicious way; they're acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. They're seeking support, which is a valid request. The mom's refusal to engage or offer help might be contributing to the author's difficulty in managing their weight. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to address a health concern and is seeking assistance. It's not their fault that they have a hard time resisting food, and asking their caregiver to support their health goals is reasonable. The mom's response is not helpful, but the author isn't at fault for recognizing this and wanting to make changes. \n\nThere's no indication the author is being inconsiderate or aggressive. They've approached the conversations as kindly and calmly as possible. The mom's blame and lack of support are on her. The author's desire to take control once they move out also shows they're taking steps on their own, which is proactive.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to manage a health issue and are asking for support, which is a valid and reasonable thing to do.\n"
