Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, lives with their mom, and both are obese. The mom cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to stop because they can't resist eating it, the mom responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is contributing to their obesity and tried to talk about it, but the mom blames them. Now the author is trying to lose weight on their own but is frustrated that their mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult but still living at home. They're trying to address a health issue, which is significant. The mom's response seems dismissive. The author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight problem but is pointing out that the mom's actions make it harder. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mom accountable for creating an environment that's not conducive to their weight loss goals.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author is an adult and has personal agency, it's reasonable to ask for support from family, especially when there's a recognized issue. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's struggle with self-control, which they've mentioned they have. The author is seeking help, not necessarily blaming the mom entirely but asking for a supportive environment.\n\nConsidering societal norms and advice on family dynamics, it's common for people to seek support from loved ones when making lifestyle changes. The mom's lack of support here could be seen as unhelpful, but does that make the author in the wrong for wanting that support? Probably not. The author is taking steps to improve their health, which is positive, and is honest about their challenges.\n\nHowever, the author is still living with the mom, and there might be limitations on what changes can be made. The author's plan to move out and then focus on weight loss is a valid approach. The main conflict is communication between the two. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful, but the author's request for support isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to manage their health and have communicated their needs. The mom's lack of support is part of the problem, but the author isn't at fault for wanting that support. The answer should be B (No).\n"
