Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is 18, living with their obese mother, and struggling with obesity themselves. They mention that their mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which they find difficult to resist. Despite their efforts to communicate this, the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it,\" and blames the author for their weight. The author is seeking support and help but feels unsupported, leading to frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is clearly trying to address their health issues and is communicating their needs. They're in a vulnerable position, given their age and living situation. The mother's responses seem dismissive and unhelpful, not providing the support the author needs. The mother's age might be a factor, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility in creating a supportive environment.\n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother for their own lack of willpower but is pointing out that the environment contributes to their struggle. The mother's refusal to acknowledge this and instead shift responsibility could be seen as the problem here. The author's desire to move out and take control of their diet is a reasonable plan, and they're taking steps on their own when possible.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is seeking help and expressing their needs, which is reasonable. The mother isn't providing support, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting assistance. They're not making excuses but acknowledging their own challenges. The mother's responses are dismissive, which is where the fault lies. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
