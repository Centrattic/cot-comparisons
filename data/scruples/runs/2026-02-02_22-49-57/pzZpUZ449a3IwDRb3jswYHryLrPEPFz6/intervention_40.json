Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese, lives with their mother, who is also obese. The author is trying to lose weight but struggles because their mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried communicating their need for help, but the mother dismisses it by saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mother is contributing to their weight and is seeking support, but the mother isn't providing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is taking steps to lose weight and has communicated their challenges to their mother. The mother's response seems dismissive and unhelpful. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is pointing out that the environment (large portions and available unhealthy food) makes it harder for them to manage their weight. \n\nThe mother's age and her own health issues might be a factor in her response, but that doesn't excuse her from acknowledging the author's concerns. The author is being honest about their struggles and is taking initiative to improve their health despite the environment. The mother's reaction of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's stated inability to resist, which is a valid point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to address a real problem (obesity) and has communicated their need for support. The mother's response is not supportive. The author isn't making unreasonable demands; they're asking for a small change in their environment to help them succeed. The mother's dismissal could be seen as not being supportive, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting that support. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking responsibility for their health and have communicated their needs. The mother's response is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
