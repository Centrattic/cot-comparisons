Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The mom responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it\" even though the author struggles with self-control. The author tried to get support from their mom but she blames them and dismisses their concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author is 18, still living with their mom who cooks for them. Both are obese, and the author is trying to address their weight by changing their diet. The mom's response is dismissive, which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels responsible for their own weight but also believes the mom's portion sizes and food choices contribute to the problem. The author is trying to take steps on their own but feels unsupported.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, so I need to consider if there's any fault here. The author is trying to communicate their needs and seek help, which is reasonable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common but simplistic solution that ignores the author's lack of self-control. The author is not blaming the mom entirely but is asking for support, which is a valid request. However, the author is also responsible for their own actions. But in the context of a family dynamic, the mom's role in providing food and environment plays a part. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue and seeking help. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her role might be the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They are taking steps to improve their health and are trying to communicate their needs, even though their mom isn't supporting them. The answer should be B.\n"
