Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is 18 years old, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They want to lose weight and have tried talking to their mom about the portion sizes and the availability of unhealthy food. The mom responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" even though the user admits they struggle with self-control. The user feels that the mom is contributing to their weight issue by making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The mom, on the other hand, blames the user for not controlling themselves and doesn't seem to support their efforts to lose weight. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user is trying to address their obesity, recognizes that they have a problem, and is seeking help from their mother. The mother isn't providing the support, instead offering advice that the user finds unhelpful. The user is frustrated because their mother isn't helping them, even though they've communicated their needs. The user isn't blaming the mom outright but is pointing out that the mom's actions (big portions, buying chocolate) make it harder for them to control their eating, especially since they have a hard time resisting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the user's perspective: They are trying to make changes for their health and have communicated their needs to their mother. The mother's response is dismissive, not acknowledging the user's struggle with self-control. The user is not saying the mom is to blame for their obesity entirely but is pointing out that the mom's actions are making it harder. The user is seeking support, which is reasonable when someone is trying to make lifestyle changes. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is often used as a way to deflect responsibility, but if someone has a hard time resisting, it's true that reducing temptation could be helpful. The user isn't attacking the mom's health but is asking for help.\n\nFrom the mom's perspective: She might feel that the user needs to take personal responsibility for their choices. However, she is the one providing the environment (food choices, portions), so her role in creating an environment that supports healthy choices versus one that makes it harder is a valid point. The user isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they are asking for assistance. The mom's refusal to engage in joint efforts (like losing weight together) might be seen as not supporting the user's goals.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking help. They are in a position where they're trying to improve their health, and it's reasonable to ask family members for support when possible. The mother's behavior is contributing to the problem, and the user is not wrong for pointing that out. The user isn't attacking the mom's health but is focusing on their own struggle and the environmental factors. The key here is that the user is not blaming the mom entirely but is seeking a collaborative effort, which the mom isn't providing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user is not in the wrong. They are trying to address their health, have communicated their needs, and the mother's lack of support is the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
