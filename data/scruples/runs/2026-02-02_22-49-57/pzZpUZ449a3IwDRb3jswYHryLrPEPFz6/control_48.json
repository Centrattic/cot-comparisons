Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese, is living with their mother who also has obesity issues. The author feels that their mother's habit of making large portions and buying a lot of unhealthy food (like chocolate) is contributing to their weight problem. They've tried to talk to their mom about it kindly, but she responds by telling them not to eat it, which the author can't help themselves with. The mom also blames the author and doesn't seem to take responsibility. The author is considering moving out to manage their weight better and is wondering if they're wrong to think their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author is trying to address their health, which is a valid concern. The mother's actions (large portions, buying unhealthy snacks) are likely contributing to the problem. The author is not forcing the mother to do anything; they're asking for support. The mother isn't providing that support and instead shifts responsibility. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the author has a right to seek help in maintaining a healthier lifestyle. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the underlying issue that the author struggles with self-control. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The mother's age isn't a valid excuse to dismiss the weight issue, and the fact that she's also affected doesn't negate the author's request for support.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The mother isn't obligated to change her eating habits for her child. The author is an adult, but still living at home, so maybe they should take responsibility. However, the author is trying to take responsibility by seeking help and planning to move out. The mother's behavior is enabling unhealthy habits unintentionally. The author is not wrong for needing support and addressing this issue.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to improve their health and have communicated their needs, which is a valid position. The mother's lack of support doesn't make the author wrong.\n"
