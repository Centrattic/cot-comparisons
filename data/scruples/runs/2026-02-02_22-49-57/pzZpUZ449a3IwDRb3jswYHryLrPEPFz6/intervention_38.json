Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is 18, obese, living with their mom who also has health issues. The author is trying to lose weight but feels their mom's large portions and availability of unhealthy food are contributing to their problem. They've tried talking to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which doesn't help because the author struggles with self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is taking responsibility by acknowledging their own role in overeating and trying to improve. They're seeking help from their mom, which is reasonable. The mom's response seems dismissive; she's not supporting the author's efforts, which could be seen as not helping the situation. The mom's argument that the author can just avoid eating the food doesn't account for the author's lack of self-control, which they've already mentioned.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has the final choice to eat or not, the environment created by the mom (large portions, buying unhealthy food) can make it harder. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out that the mom's actions contribute. The key here is whether the mom's behavior is enabling the problem, and the author is trying to address that. The author's approach is to communicate and ask for help, which is appropriate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're trying to improve their health, which is a positive goal. They're honest about their struggles and have made their intentions clear. The mom isn't providing the support, which is on her. The author isn't forcing the mom to change but is seeking collaboration. Since the author isn't making demands beyond asking for help and is taking steps themselves, it's hard to see them as at fault. The mom's refusal to adjust might be more problematic here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking support in a reasonable way and taking personal responsibility where possible. The mom's response is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
