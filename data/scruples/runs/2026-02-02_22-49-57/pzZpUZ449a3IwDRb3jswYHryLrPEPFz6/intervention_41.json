Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and has tried to talk to her about portion sizes and the availability of unhealthy food. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author struggles with self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address their health issues, which is a positive step. They've communicated their concerns to their mom but haven't received the support they hoped for. The mom's responses are dismissive, which can make the situation frustrating for the author.\n\nIs the author wrong to feel that way? Well, it's their body and their health. They have a right to want to make changes, even if their mom isn't supportive. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out that the environment contributes to their struggles. The mom's refusal to adjust portions or stop buying unhealthy food could indeed make it harder for the author to manage their weight. \n\nHowever, the author is an adult now (18), so they should have some autonomy. But since they still live with their mom, the environment is shared. The author's approach seems reasonable\u2014trying to communicate calmly and seeking help. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" ignores the author's self-control issues, which the author has already explained. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the author is taking responsibility by trying to eat healthier, which is commendable. The mom isn't in denial but is not cooperating, which is a common family dynamic. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. They are not blaming the mom for their entire obesity but recognizing a contributing factor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
