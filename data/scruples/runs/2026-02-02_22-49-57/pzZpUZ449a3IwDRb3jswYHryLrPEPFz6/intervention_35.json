Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author feeling that their mother is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity, and the mother's dismissive responses.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author is 18, lives with their mom, both are obese. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author can't control themselves and has tried to talk to the mom about this. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author feels is unhelpful. The author is blaming the mom for their weight and wants help, but the mom is resistant.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics here. The author is trying to communicate their needs and is met with resistance. The mom's advice, while technically true (you don't have to eat it), doesn't address the author's difficulty in self-control. The author feels that the mom's actions (overfeeding) are part of the problem. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility? Well, self-control is part of it, but the environment also plays a role. If the mom is creating a trigger (large portions, easy access to unhealthy food), that can hinder the author's efforts. The author is seeking support from their mom, which is reasonable. The mom's refusal to help could be contributing to the problem.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for feeling this way? Probably not. They're acknowledging their own struggle and seeking help, which is a positive step. The mother's dismissiveness is the issue here. The author isn't blaming the mom for all their weight issues but is recognizing that the environment is a factor. \n\nSo the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author is taking steps to address the problem despite the mother's uncooperative attitude. The mother should support the author's health goals, but the author isn't at fault for wanting that support.\n"
