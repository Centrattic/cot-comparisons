Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their mom. The author is 18, obese, and lives with their mom who also makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author can't resist eating it and tried talking to their mom, but she keeps telling them they don't have to eat it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their weight issue by changing their diet, which is a responsible approach. They've communicated their struggles to their mom multiple times. The mom's response is dismissive, not providing support. The author is asking if they're wrong for feeling that their mom contributes to their overeating.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility. The author is taking steps to improve their health, which is positive. The mom, instead of offering help, is enabling the problem by making large portions and not listening. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is seeking support. Since the mom isn't providing that support, the author is trying to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for wanting to lose weight and needing help. The mom's resistance is part of the problem. The author is not shaming the mom for her weight but trying to get assistance in their own health journey. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to take responsibility for their health despite a challenging environment.\n"
