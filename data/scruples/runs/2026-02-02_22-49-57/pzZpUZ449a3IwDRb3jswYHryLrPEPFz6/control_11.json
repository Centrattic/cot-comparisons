Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author feels their mom is contributing to their weight issues by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. They've tried talking to their mom, but she dismisses their concerns and blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're 18 and still living with their mom. They're struggling with their weight and have a BMI around 40, which is classified as obese. They mention that their mom also has weight issues but isn't addressing it. The author is trying to take steps to manage their weight but feels unsupported. The mom's response is to tell them not to eat the food, which the author finds unhelpful because they can't control themselves once the food is there.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's see. The author is expressing concern about their health and seeking support from their parent. They aren't directly attacking their mom but are asking for help. The mom's response is dismissive and not supportive, which is a common issue in family dynamics. The author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their health. However, they might not be considering their mom's perspective or the challenges of changing eating habits as a family.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the author isn't doing anything wrong by advocating for their health. They're trying to communicate their needs. The mom's refusal to help isn't the author's responsibility. The author's plan to start managing their weight when they move out seems reasonable. So, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
