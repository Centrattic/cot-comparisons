Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is 18, obese, living with their mother who is also obese. The mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to stop, the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mother is overfeeding them and contributing to their weight problem. They tried to talk to the mother about it, but she blames them and refuses to consider losing weight herself. The author is now trying to handle it themselves and plans to move out in four years.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the elements. The author is taking responsibility for their health by trying to address their weight, which is a positive step. They have a valid concern about their mother's habits contributing to their obesity. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the author's struggle with self-control. The mother's own obesity might indicate similar issues, but that doesn't mean the author's request is wrong.\n\nThe author is seeking help and support from their mother, which is reasonable. It's common for family dynamics to influence eating habits, so the author's frustration is understandable. The mother's refusal to engage in a weight loss plan and her blame-shifting are problematic. The author isn't making the mother's habits right, but they're not wrong for wanting to address the issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for pointing out the mother's role in their weight problem? Probably not. They're acknowledging their own responsibility by trying to change their habits but are also recognizing the environmental factors. The mother's behavior is enabling the problem, so the author's concern is valid. The key is whether the author's approach is respectful and constructive. From the post, they tried to talk kindly and calmly, which is appropriate. The mother's reactions are the issue here, not the author's initial stance.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking help and trying to improve their health, which is a reasonable response. The mother's behavior is the main problem here.\n"
