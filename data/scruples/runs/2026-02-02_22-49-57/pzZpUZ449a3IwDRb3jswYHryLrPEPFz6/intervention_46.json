Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is 18 years old, obese, lives with their mom, and the mom is also obese. The author is trying to lose weight but finds it hard because their mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. When the author tells their mom, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves. The author tried to explain that their mom's actions contribute to their weight issue, but the mom blames them. The author is now doing what they can on their own and plans to move out to lose weight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is seeking help from their mom to support their weight loss, but the mom isn't cooperating. The mom's response is dismissive. The author isn't asking the mom to stop eating, just to adjust her actions that make it harder for the author. The mom's behavior, like making large portions and buying chocolate, creates an environment that's challenging for the author. The author is trying to take responsibility by doing what they can, but they're in an environment that's not supportive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom's actions might contribute to the problem, but the author is also trying to take steps. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is pointing out how their behavior affects them. The mom's refusal to consider the author's needs might be where the problem lies. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're trying to address a health issue and have communicated their needs. The mom isn't supporting them, which is a separate issue. The author is in a situation where they have limited control, especially living with family. They're taking initiative by planning to move out and take charge of their diet. \n\nFactors to consider: Age (18 is an adult, but still living with parents, which is common). The author is taking steps to improve their health despite the challenges. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author's main issue is the environment, not their own choices entirely. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should focus on their own choices instead of blaming the mom. But the author is aware of their own lack of willpower in the current environment and is asking for support. The mom's refusal to adjust her behavior is the crux here. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
