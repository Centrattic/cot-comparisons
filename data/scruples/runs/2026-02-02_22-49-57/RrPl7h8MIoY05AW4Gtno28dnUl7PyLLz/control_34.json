I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month.

I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. The parents are offering an apartment, but the person is choosing a different room. They're worried it might offend their mom, especially since they want to maintain trust.\n\nHmm, first, the person is 21, so an adult. They're setting up a payment arrangement with their parents. It's not exactly rent, but part of it is for owed money. So, creating a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The concern is about offending them by making it formal, which could seem like not trusting their honesty.\n\nI think the key here is whether the person is doing something unreasonable. The parents are described as honest, but the person has a gut feeling to document. It's about financial responsibility. The question is whether this is the person's right to do, even if it might feel odd to the parents.\n\nIn adult relationships, even within families, keeping records can be responsible, especially if there's a financial arrangement. It's not necessarily a sign of distrust; it's more about clarity and accountability. The person isn't being confrontational, just wanting to document. They're also considering how to approach it without being an asshole, so they're aware of the sensitivity.\n\nThe parents might feel like they're being treated like outsiders, but the person is handling it respectfully by asking them to sign. There's no evidence here that the person is acting in bad faith. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They're making a responsible choice to protect themselves and ensure transparency, which is understandable.\n"
