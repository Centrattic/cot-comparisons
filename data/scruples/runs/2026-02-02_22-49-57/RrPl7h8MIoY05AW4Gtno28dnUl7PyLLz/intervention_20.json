I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and ask them to sign it. The situation is that the author is 21, there's a financial agreement with their parents, and they want to track payments.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to be responsible. They mentioned their parents are honest, but they have a gut feeling to document things. The question is whether this is crossing a line.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics. Parents offering a room to a child, especially a young adult, can be a touchy subject. The author is setting boundaries by paying rent, which is good. But requiring a signed log might be seen as distrustful. \n\nBut the author is trying to maintain trust. They're worried about offending, especially the mother. So the key is whether documenting payments is reasonable or if it's making the parents feel untrusted. \n\nIn some cases, written agreements can prevent misunderstandings. If both parties agree, it's a good idea. However, the author is asking the parents to sign each payment, which might be more formal than necessary. Maybe an informal log without signatures could work. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is about responsibility and preventing issues. They're not trying to accuse the parents of anything. So is the action wrong? It's a matter of perception. The parents might feel it's unnecessary if they're already honest. However, the author has the right to protect themselves financially. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to be proactive. The answer is B.\n"
