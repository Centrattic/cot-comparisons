I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures.\n\nFirst, the author is 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and owed money. They want to document this with a log that includes date, amount, and signatures. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the author prefers the lower floor. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to track payments, possibly due to financial instability in the family.\n\nThe author is concerned about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feels it might undermine trust. They want to do this responsibly without seeming untrusting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are offering a living arrangement, which is a form of financial arrangement. Even if it's within a family, documenting payments is a reasonable way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings. It's a practical step, especially given the parents' financial situation, which adds stress. The author isn't doing this out of distrust but as a safeguard. \n\nIn many cases, having a written agreement, even informally, is a good practice. It protects both parties. The author is taking responsibility for their part of the agreement by wanting to track payments. The parents might feel offended, but that's more about their reaction than the author's right to document. The author is trying to balance trust with practicality, which is understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting responsibly to ensure transparency, which is a valid approach. The potential offense lies in how it's presented, not the act itself. The author is aware of the sensitivity and is trying to handle it carefully.\n"
