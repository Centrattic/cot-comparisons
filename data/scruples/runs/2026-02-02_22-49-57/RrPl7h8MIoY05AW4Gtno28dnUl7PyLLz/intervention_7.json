I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents to track rent and other money owed. The author is 21, and their family is going through financial difficulties. They've agreed on a monthly payment of $700, but they're worried about recording these payments and getting signatures, fearing it might offend their parents, especially the mom.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that they want to be responsible, but they're also concerned about trust and honesty. They don't want to seem like they don't trust their parents. So the question is whether keeping a log and asking for signatures is wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is an adult child helping their parents financially, which is a common situation. However, creating a formal log might be seen as necessary for both parties to have a clear record. Financial agreements, even within families, can lead to misunderstandings if not documented. The author's intention here is to prevent disputes, which is a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that the logging is unnecessary and could hurt their feelings. The author is right to be cautious about how to present this. The key is whether the act of keeping a log is inherently wrong or if the way it's presented matters more.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's reasonable for the author to want a record. However, the approach should be sensitive. Instead of just starting a log and asking for signatures, the author should probably communicate their reasons to the parents first. Explaining that it's to ensure everyone's on the same page and avoid future confusion might help. The author's concern about offending the parents is valid, but the motivation is good.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they proceed without considering the parents' feelings, maybe. But since they're thinking about the impact and looking for a respectful way to do it, the answer might be no. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family harmony. The problem isn't the log itself but how it's handled. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document payments, but they need to approach it carefully.\n"
