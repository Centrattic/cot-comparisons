I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 21-year-old who's paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to keep a log with signatures but are worried it might offend their parents, especially the mother, and question if it's undermining trust.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is a case where the author is doing something wrong. The key points here are about setting boundaries, financial responsibility, and maintaining family relationships. \n\nThe author is an adult, which is important. At 21, they're legally an adult, and maintaining financial independence is a common concern. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document the payments. This could be due to several reasons: maybe they want clear records for their own peace of mind, or perhaps there's a history of financial misunderstandings. \n\nKeeping a log isn't inherently wrong. It's a responsible action to ensure both parties have a clear understanding of what's been paid. However, the concern is about how to present it without offending. The author is worried that asking for signatures might seem like distrust. The parents might feel that the child is treating them like a landlord, which could create tension. \n\nBut, the author is trying to be considerate. They acknowledge their parents' honesty and are seeking advice on how to approach it respectfully. The main issue isn't the act of keeping a log, but the way it's communicated. If done in a way that's collaborative and not confrontational, it could be seen as a responsible step. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Cultural context might play a role. In some families, formalizing such agreements is common, while others might find it unusual. The parents might prefer a more informal understanding. Also, the amount of money involved is significant ($700 a month), so documentation can protect both sides. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're transparent and explain it's for their own records, not to imply dishonesty, then it's reasonable. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author is taking a proactive step to manage finances responsibly, and as long as it's done with mutual understanding, it's not wrong. However, the approach matters. The author needs to frame it as a way to keep everyone on the same page rather than an accusation. So the answer is B.\n"
