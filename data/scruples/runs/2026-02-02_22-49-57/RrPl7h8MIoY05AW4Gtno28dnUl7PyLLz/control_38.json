I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and having them sign it. The situation is that the author, who is 21, is making monthly payments to their parents because the family is going through financial tough times. The author wants to document the payments but is worried about offending their parents, especially the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let's break it down. The author is trying to be responsible by keeping a record. They're concerned about trust and honesty. They're not outright accusing their parents of being dishonest, but they have a \"gut feeling\" they should record the payments. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, keeping a log is a reasonable step, especially when dealing with money. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings in the future. The parents are described as honest, so it's not about distrust but about having a paper trail. \n\nHowever, the author is worried about offending their parents. Maybe the parents might feel that the log implies they're not trustworthy. The key here is how the author approaches it. If they explain it as a way to maintain transparency and mutual understanding, it might be less offensive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is just trying to document a mutual agreement and not accusing the parents of anything, then they're not necessarily in the wrong. The intention is to be responsible, not to distrust. So the answer would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong; they're taking a prudent step to ensure clarity in a financial agreement within the family.\n"
