I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents and having them sign it. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nSo, the main question is whether this action is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nI should consider the context. The parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need for documentation. Financial transactions between family members can be tricky. While trust is important, sometimes documentation is necessary to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nIs there any legal or ethical issue here? Legally, creating a record of payments isn't wrong. Ethically, it depends on the family dynamics. The person is being responsible by wanting a clear record, which could prevent disputes later. However, the potential for offending the parents is a valid concern. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the parents agree to the arrangement, then documenting it isn't inherently wrong. The author is trying to be careful and responsible. The fact that they're considering how to approach it without offending them shows they care about the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking a responsible step to manage finances, which is a reasonable action. The key is whether they communicate this properly to their parents to maintain trust, but the intent isn't malicious.\n"
