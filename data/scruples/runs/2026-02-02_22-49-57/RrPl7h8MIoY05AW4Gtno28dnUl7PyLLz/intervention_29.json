I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments and asking their parents to sign it. The situation involves a 21-year-old who's paying $700 monthly to their parents, and they want a record to be responsible but also concerned about offending them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions financial difficulties at home, so maybe there's some stress or past issues that make them want documentation. They value trust and honesty, so the act of creating a log might be seen as a way to maintain that trust rather than undermine it. \n\nBut why would they think it might offend their parents? Maybe their parents have a different view of family dynamics, expecting trust without written records. The author is trying to balance responsibility with not seeming distrustful. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document financial transactions isn't inherently wrong. It's a common practice in many situations to have records to avoid misunderstandings. However, the way they approach it matters. If they frame it as a responsible action to ensure clarity and prevent future disputes, it's reasonable. But if it's done without explanation and appears as a lack of trust, that could be offending.\n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. The author's intent is to be responsible and maintain trust, not to accuse. If they explain their reasoning to their parents and approach it respectfully, it's a valid action. So the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
