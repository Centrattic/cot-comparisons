I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is wrong for wanting to keep a payment log with their parents. The person is 21 and paying them $700 a month. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to avoid misunderstandings, but they're worried about offending their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents offered the apartment, and the person is helping out financially. The key here is the reason behind the log. The person isn't doing this out of distrust but as a responsible measure. They even mention it might chip away at trust, which shows they care about their parents' feelings.\n\nIn such situations, maintaining clear records can prevent disputes later. It's a common practice in financial agreements to have written records. The person isn't accusing their parents of anything; they're just ensuring both sides have a record. The parents are described as honest, so the log isn't about questioning their integrity but about mutual accountability.\n\nThe concern is about potential offense, but the approach is to ask for signatures, which is a standard way to formalize agreements. If done respectfully, like explaining the reason and not implying distrust, it's reasonable. The author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust. So, the person isn't wrong for wanting this. Answer B.\n"
