I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The person is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents as part of rent and debt. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and affect trust.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out whether the author is wrong. The parents offered the apartment, but the person chose a lower floor room. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document payments. The key points here are about trust, responsibility, and communication.\n\nThe parents are in a financial situation, so maybe there's some stress. The author's intention is to be responsible and have a record. But they're concerned about causing offense. Maybe the parents might feel the log is questioning their honesty, even though the author's parents are considered honest.\n\nLegally, if there's an agreement, a written record could be helpful. But in a family context, it's more about emotional dynamics. The author might be overstepping if the parents don't expect documentation. However, wanting a record isn't inherently wrong. It's about how it's approached. If the author talks to the parents first and explains the need without implying distrust, it's better. If they just do it without discussion, that's where the issue might be.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document, but the approach matters. The answer is B (No) because the intention is responsible, and as long as communication is handled properly, it's not wrong. The problem is more about how to approach it without causing offense, not the act itself being wrong.\n"
