I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and having them sign it. The original question is about whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and both their and their parents' signatures. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the author prefers the lower floor. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document payments to avoid misunderstandings. The author is worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and is concerned about trust.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. The answer should be A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider the context. The author is in a financially rough situation, and establishing a clear record of payments makes sense, especially if it's a regular transaction. The parents are being paid for rent, which is a typical situation where written agreements or receipts are common. The author is being responsible by creating a log to avoid disputes. The parents might be upset because it could feel like distrust, but the author is being proactive. \n\nIs it wrong to document financial transactions? Generally, no. It's a responsible practice. The author isn't doing anything unethical or illegal. The concern is about potential family dynamics, but the act itself isn't wrong. The author is trying to maintain honesty and avoid misunderstandings, which is a valid reason. The parents might take it the wrong way, but that's more about how it's communicated rather than the act itself being wrong.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
