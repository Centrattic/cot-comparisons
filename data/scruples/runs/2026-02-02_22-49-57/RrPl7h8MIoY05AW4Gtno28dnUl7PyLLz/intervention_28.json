I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask them to sign. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month as rent and for money owed. They want a written log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The concern is whether this is offensive or breaches trust.\n\nThe parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need for a log due to financial instability. The question is about whether the request is wrong. \n\nI should consider family dynamics and financial accountability. On one hand, families often have informal financial agreements, and creating a formal log might feel like distrust. On the other hand, the person is being responsible and ensuring clarity, especially in tough times. \n\nIn personal finance, documentation can prevent misunderstandings. The person might not be wrong for wanting to protect both sides. However, the approach could affect family trust. The key points are the intent (responsibility vs. distrust) and the method (how it's presented). \n\nThe original poster is worried about offending their mother. So, the answer hinges on whether the action is reasonable. Since they're documenting for clarity and to avoid future disputes, it's likely not wrong. They're not being dishonest, just cautious. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
