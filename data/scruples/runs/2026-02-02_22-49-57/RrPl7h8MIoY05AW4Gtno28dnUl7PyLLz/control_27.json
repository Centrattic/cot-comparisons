I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying $700 monthly to their parents for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels a need for documentation.\n\nFirst, is there any wrongdoing in wanting to keep a record? The user's intention is to be responsible, not to distrust their parents. They are concerned about offending them, especially the mom, and feel it might affect trust. But is that a valid concern? \n\nFinancial transactions, even within families, can lead to misunderstandings. Having a log is a common practice to avoid disputes. The user isn't withholding money or being dishonest. They're just documenting their payments. \n\nThe parents offered an apartment, but the user chose a different room. That choice might affect the perceived fairness, but the user is still paying the agreed amount. The log is about accountability, not a lack of trust. \n\nSo, the user isn't wrong for wanting to document. They're taking proactive steps to ensure clarity. The key is how they approach it. If they explain it as a responsible measure and not a distrust, the parents might understand. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
