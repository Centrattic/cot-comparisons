I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for their signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to keep track. They're worried about offending their parents, especially their mom, and feel it might affect trust.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the person's intention is to be responsible, they trust their parents but have a gut feeling to document, and they're concerned about how it might be perceived.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document financial transactions isn't inherently wrong. In fact, it's a responsible step, especially when dealing with family. However, family dynamics can be sensitive. The key factors here are the parents' perception and the way the log is introduced.\n\nThe author is trying to be responsible, which is good. But the concern is about offending the parents. Maybe the issue is not the action itself but how it's communicated. If the author approaches it as a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, it's a reasonable request. However, if it's perceived as a lack of trust, that could cause tension. Since the parents are described as honest, the author might need to frame it as a mutual agreement for transparency rather than suspicion.\n\nIn many cases, even between family, written records can prevent future disputes. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by wanting to document this. The problem might be more about the parents' feelings rather than the author's actions being wrong. So, the answer is likely B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain a record responsibly.\n"
