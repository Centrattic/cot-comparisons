I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The author is 21, paying $700 monthly to their parents, and wants a signed log to record payments. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and possibly damaging trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's parents are offering the upstairs apartment but they prefer the lower floor room. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to track payments, which might come from a sense of financial security or past experiences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intent and communication. The author isn't trying to accuse the parents of anything; they just want a record for their own peace of mind. This is a common practice in many transactions, even within families. However, family dynamics can be more sensitive. The key here is how the author approaches it. If they present it as a necessary step for their own accountability and not as a distrust, it might be more palatable.\n\nThe author is concerned about offending their mother. So, the way they frame the request matters. If they explain it's for their own records and to ensure everyone is on the same page, it's responsible. But if they come in with an accusatory tone, that's different. Since the post shows the author is thinking about how to do it without being an ass, they're likely trying to be respectful.\n\nFinancial arrangements in family can be tricky. Even though it's between family members, having a paper trail isn't unreasonable. It's about protecting both sides. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting this. They're acting responsibly. The parents might feel it's unnecessary, but that doesn't make the author at fault. The author's intention is to maintain trust, not undermine it. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
