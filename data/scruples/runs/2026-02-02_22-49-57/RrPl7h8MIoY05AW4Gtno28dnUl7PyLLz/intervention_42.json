I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask them to sign it. The author is 21, and there's a financial agreement where they pay $700 a month to their parents. The parents are offering the upstairs apartment, but the author prefers the lower floor.\n\nThe author is concerned that keeping a log might offend their parents, especially their mother, and feels it could erode trust. The question is whether this is the author's fault or not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Financial agreements between family members can be tricky. On one hand, the author is showing responsibility by wanting to document the payments, which is a reasonable step to avoid misunderstandings. On the other hand, family dynamics and trust are important. The author is worried about offending their parents, which is valid because family relationships can be sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent is responsible and practical, but the method might be perceived as distrustful. The parents are described as honest, so the author's concern about offending them is understandable. However, the author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family harmony. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to document the payments? Probably not. It's a common practice in financial transactions to have records. However, the way it's approached matters. The author is considering how to do this without being an asshole, which shows they're trying to be thoughtful. \n\nPossible arguments against the author being in the wrong: needing a record for their own peace of mind, ensuring both parties are on the same page, and preventing future disputes. \n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong: if the parents feel the log is unnecessary and that it undermines trust, especially if there's no history of issues. But the author mentions the family's financial situation is rough, so having a log could actually help avoid conflicts.\n\nI think the author is right to want documentation but needs to approach it carefully. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer is B (No). They're not in the wrong for wanting to document the payments responsibly.\n"
