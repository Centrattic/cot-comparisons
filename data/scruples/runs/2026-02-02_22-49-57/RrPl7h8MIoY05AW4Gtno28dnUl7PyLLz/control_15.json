      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for their signatures. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, living at home, and has agreed to pay their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They\u2019re worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and question if it's respecting trust.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the person is trying to be responsible by documenting the payments, but they're concerned about how it might be perceived. The parents are described as honest, but the user has a gut feeling they need to record the payments. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, setting boundaries and being responsible with finances is reasonable. Documenting payments can prevent misunderstandings and provide clarity, which is especially important when there's a power dynamic like parent and child. It's not uncommon for adults living at home to handle finances transparently.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that this documentation is a lack of trust, given the familial relationship. The user is aware of this potential issue and is trying to approach it sensitively. The fact that they're considering the parents' feelings and trying to avoid being an asshole shows they're not acting out of malice but out of caution.\n\nTrust is a big part of family dynamics. The user mentions that the parents are honest, which is why they're hesitant to implement the log. However, in cases where money is involved, even within families, documentation can be a responsible measure. It's a way to protect both parties in case of disputes or misunderstandings in the future. \n\nThe key here is the intention. The user isn't trying to accuse or distrust the parents, but rather to ensure clarity and responsibility. The question is whether this action breaches the trust. Since the user is being transparent about the purpose and is trying to handle it respectfully, it seems like a reasonable precaution rather than an act of disloyalty.\n\nIn many financial agreements, even between friends, written records are common. Applying that to family matters can be a way to maintain healthy financial boundaries. The parents might be more upset about the implication of distrust than the act itself, but the user is trying to avoid that by being thoughtful in their approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a responsible step to maintain financial clarity without necessarily breaching trust, as long as it's done respectfully. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
