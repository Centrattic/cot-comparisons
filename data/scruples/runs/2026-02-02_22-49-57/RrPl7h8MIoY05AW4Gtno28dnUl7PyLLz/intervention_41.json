I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask them to sign it. The person is 21, living at home, and paying their parents $700 a month, part of which is for rent and part for a debt. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents and damaging trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. Parents and children often have a close relationship where trust is important. The author's motivation is to be responsible and ensure there's a record, which is understandable, especially if there's financial stress. But the parents might see it as a lack of trust. \n\nFinancial agreements between family members can be tricky. On one hand, the author wants a clear record, which is practical. On the other hand, the parents might feel it's unnecessary and a breach of trust. The author is concerned about offending, particularly the mother. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to document payments isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to avoid misunderstandings, especially if the money is for a debt. The key is how they approach it. If they frame it as wanting to be responsible and keep things clear for everyone's benefit, it's less likely to be seen as a personal attack. However, if they present it as distrust, that could be problematic. \n\nThe parents might feel the author doesn't trust them, which could hurt feelings. But the author is being considerate by worrying about their reaction, which shows they care. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do this. They're taking responsible steps, and the approach matters in how it's received. The answer should be B (No).\n"
