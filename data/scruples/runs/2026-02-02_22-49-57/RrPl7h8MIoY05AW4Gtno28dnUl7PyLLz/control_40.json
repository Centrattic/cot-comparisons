I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want a written log with signatures to document the payments. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and that it could undermine trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, the person is setting boundaries and trying to be responsible with their finances. Their parents are in financial trouble, so maybe the payments are necessary. Creating a log is a way to ensure accountability on both sides. It's not about distrust but about clarity. The parents offered the apartment, but the person chose a different room. The log would confirm each payment, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the parents are described as honest, so maybe the person is overdoing it? However, the person has a gut feeling something's off. Maybe they're worried about potential disputes later. It's better to have documentation than to risk misunderstandings. The key here is that the person is not accusing the parents of being dishonest, just documenting for themselves. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if they approach it respectfully, maybe the parents would understand. The person is trying to maintain trust while being responsible. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). They're taking proactive steps without assuming bad faith from the parents.\n"
