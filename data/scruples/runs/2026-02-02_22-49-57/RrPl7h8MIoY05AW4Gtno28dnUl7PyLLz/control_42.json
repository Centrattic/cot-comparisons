I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether keeping a log of payments to parents is appropriate. \n\nFirst, the user is 21 and has agreed to pay $700 monthly to their parents for rent and money owed. The parents have given them the entire upstairs apartment, but the user prefers the lower floor room. The user wants to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and question if it's responsible or if it's breaking trust.\n\nSo the key points here are: the user is trying to document financial transactions between them and their parents. They're concerned about being seen as untrustworthy or an asshole by doing so. The parents are described as honest, but there's a potential financial strain.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, documenting transactions is usually a good practice. It prevents misunderstandings and provides a clear record. However, in a family context, there might be emotional implications. The parents might feel that this is treating them like strangers, which could hurt feelings, especially if the user's mother is more sensitive about it.\n\nBut the user does mention that their parents are honest and that the feeling to record payments is a \"gut feeling.\" This suggests they trust their parents but want to protect themselves, which is a reasonable approach given financial situations can be stressful. The user's intention is to be responsible, not to accuse the parents of dishonesty.\n\nThe question is whether the method of creating a log with signatures is appropriate. If the user approaches it respectfully, explaining that it's for their own records and to ensure clarity, it might not be seen as an offense. However, if it's presented in a way that implies distrust, then it could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering both the practical need for documentation and the emotional aspects of family dynamics, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to keep a record. They are being proactive about financial responsibility. The key is how they communicate this to their parents. If done with sensitivity, it's a responsible action. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
