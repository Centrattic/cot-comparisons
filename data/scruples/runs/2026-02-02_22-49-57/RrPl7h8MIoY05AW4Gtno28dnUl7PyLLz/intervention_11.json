I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong by keeping a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures. The original question was posted on a forum like Reddit, probably r/AskReddit or similar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and about trust issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nSo, considering the context: the author is trying to be responsible. Financial arrangements between family can be tricky. Even if the parents are honest, there might be misunderstandings later. A log could help both sides, but the author is concerned about how it's presented. \n\nIs it wrong to create a record? Well, in legal terms, having a written agreement is often advisable. The author isn't doing anything illegal. The concern is about family dynamics. The author is aware that it might be seen as mistrustful, so they're trying to approach it carefully. Their intention is to be responsible, not to accuse. \n\nPossible arguments against: family trust, making it seem like they don't trust their parents. But the author is being proactive to avoid future disputes. The parents are described as honest, but financial stress can lead to conflicts. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document the payments. They're trying to be responsible and prevent problems. The key is how they present it. If they frame it as a way to keep everyone on the same page, maybe it's less offensive. But the act itself isn't wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
