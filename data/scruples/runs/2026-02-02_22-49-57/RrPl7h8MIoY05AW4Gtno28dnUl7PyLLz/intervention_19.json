I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong by wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for their signatures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's respectful.\n\nSo, the main points here are about trust and boundaries. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for a written record. In many situations, having a written agreement is a good practice, especially when money is involved. It can prevent misunderstandings later on. But since this is between family members, there might be an expectation of trust without formal documentation. \n\nThe author isn't accusing the parents of anything; they just want to be responsible. The concern is that this might seem like an accusation or a lack of trust. However, the author acknowledges that their parents are honest, which suggests they aren't trying to imply dishonesty. They're just covering their own bases. \n\nIn family matters, especially financial ones, it's common for people to have different comfort levels. The author could approach this by explaining their reasoning in a respectful way, emphasizing that it's for both their records and to avoid any future confusion. If the parents agree, that's fine. If not, maybe there's another way to reassure the author without the log. But the author isn't wrong for wanting to do this. It's about protecting themselves while maintaining good relations. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're being responsible and proactive without accusing anyone. The key is how they present it, but the intention isn't malicious.\n"
