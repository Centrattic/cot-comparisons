I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments and having their parents sign it. The person is 21, and there's been a financial agreement between them and their parents. The parents are offering an apartment but the person prefers a room on the lower floor.\n\nFirst, the user wants to know if keeping a log with signatures is wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, responsibility, and how the action might be perceived. The person is concerned that this log might offend their parents, especially the mother, and that it could affect the trust. But they also think it's responsible.\n\nIn many situations, when there's a financial agreement with family, even if it's informal, documenting it can be a good idea. It prevents misunderstandings and provides a record. However, the way it's approached matters. If done with respect and without an accusatory tone, it's more about clarity than distrust. \n\nThe parents are described as honest, but the person feels a need to document. Maybe they're worried that without a record, there could be disputes later. The log isn't about doubting the parents' honesty but ensuring both sides have a mutual agreement. \n\nBut could it be seen as an invasion of trust? Maybe. If the parents perceive it as them doubting the family's integrity, that might cause tension. However, the person's intention is to be responsible. The key is how they present it. If they explain it as a way to maintain clear records for everyone's benefit, it's less likely to be offensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're taking a responsible step to ensure there's a paper trail for their payments. The parents might be upset initially, but the motivation is to protect both parties. It's not about mistrust but about being organized. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
