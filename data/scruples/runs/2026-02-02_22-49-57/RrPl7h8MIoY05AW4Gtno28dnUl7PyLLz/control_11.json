I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether keeping a log of payments to parents is appropriate.\n\nThe person is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's necessary or if they're overstepping.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and the nature of the relationship. The parents are described as honest and great, so maybe the log is more about the person's own need for accountability. But since it's a family matter, the question is whether documenting this is a breach of trust or if it's a reasonable precaution.\n\nIn many cultures, family financial transactions can be sensitive. Even if the parents are honest, the act of requiring a signed log might be seen as distrustful. However, the person might have valid reasons, like ensuring transparency or having a reference if disputes arise. It's a balance between protecting oneself and maintaining family harmony.\n\nThe person isn't doing anything illegal, but the social aspect is critical. They're trying to avoid being \"an asshole,\" so their approach matters. If they present it as a way to keep everyone on the same page rather than implying distrust, maybe it's okay. But if the parents feel offended, that's a problem the person needs to address carefully.\n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're acting responsibly, but they need to handle it with care. But some might argue that it's unnecessary and could damage trust, making it A. However, since the question is whether they are \"in the wrong,\" not whether it's the best idea, the answer might be B. They have a legitimate reason to document, even if there's a risk of offending. Unless there's an existing agreement, documenting could be prudent. So probably B.\n"
