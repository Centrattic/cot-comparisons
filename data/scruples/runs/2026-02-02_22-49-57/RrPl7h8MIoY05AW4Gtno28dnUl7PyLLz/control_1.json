I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking for signatures. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried this might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's breaking trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial responsibility versus family trust. The author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments, which is a common practice to avoid misunderstandings. However, in a family context, there might be sensitivities. But is it wrong to want to protect both parties with a record?\n\nThe parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the author prefers the lower floor. Maybe that's a minor point, but it shows they have some autonomy. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document. It's not about distrust but about having a reference in case of disputes.\n\nIn such cases, documentation can prevent future conflicts. For example, if there's a disagreement about missed payments or amounts, the log serves as proof. The author is being proactive and responsible. However, the concern is about offending the family. The right approach would be to explain the reason calmly, emphasizing accountability for everyone, not just the parents.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're taking a responsible step that's reasonable. The answer should be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for wanting to document the payments. It's a practical measure to maintain clarity and avoid misunderstandings, which is especially important in financial matters between family members.\n"
