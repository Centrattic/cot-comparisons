I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. The author is 21, paying $700 monthly for rent and money owed. They want a record to be responsible but are worried about offending their parents.\n\nFirst, financial transparency is generally a good practice, especially when dealing with money between family members. The author isn't being dishonest; they're just creating a record to protect everyone. Parents are described as honest, but maybe the author has a reason to be cautious, like past issues or just the nature of the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether keeping a log is respectful. The author isn't hiding anything; they're just documenting transactions. The parents are adults, so they should understand the need for a written agreement. The author is concerned about trust, but the log is a way to reinforce trust through accountability. \n\nHowever, the author is worried about how it might be perceived. The question is whether this action breaches trust. Since the author is being upfront and wants both parties to sign, it's more about creating clarity rather than suspicion. The parents might feel it's unnecessary, but the author's intention is responsible, not to accuse. \n\nIn family matters, misunderstandings can happen, so having a written record is a practical step. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect both themselves and their parents. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
