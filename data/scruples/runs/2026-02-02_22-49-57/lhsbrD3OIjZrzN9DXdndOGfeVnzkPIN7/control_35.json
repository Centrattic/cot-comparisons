Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they should switch gyms with their girlfriend because the gym she suggested has a \"women only\" section. The key points here are that the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but the women-only section takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author is objecting to this as sexist, arguing that if the gym charges the same but restricts access based on gender, it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about gender equality. If a place charges the same but limits access to certain areas based on sex, that could be seen as discriminatory. It's treating men and women differently under the same price, which might be a problem. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be using the women-only section for her own safety and comfort, which is a common reason such sections exist. Gyms often have these areas to create a space where women feel less intimidated or harassed by men, which is a valid social consideration.\n\nNow, the author is saying that he wouldn't accept being charged the same but not being able to use part of the gym, so he's objecting to the reverse. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" suggests she might see the women-only section as a positive, not a negative. This could be a communication issue where both are looking at the situation from their own perspectives. The author is focusing on fairness and equality, while the girlfriend is valuing the specific benefits the women's section provides.\n\nI should check if there are legal or ethical dimensions. In many places, single-sex facilities are allowed if they're open to the other sex on a comparable basis. For example, if there's a women-only section but men can use other parts, it's not necessarily illegal. However, the author's argument is that if he can't use part of the gym, it's a problem of fairness. But the existence of such sections is often justified as promoting inclusivity and safety for women, which might be why the girlfriend is in favor.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is the asshole. The author is not in the wrong if his objection is based on a principle of fairness. However, the girlfriend might perceive it as dismissive of her needs. The answer depends on understanding both sides. The author's stance is about equality, but he might not be considering the reasons behind the women-only section. The girlfriend's frustration comes from not seeing it as a negative. So, the author's position is principled but possibly not empathetic enough. Still, that doesn't mean he's in the wrong. It's a matter of differing values and communication. The answer is likely that he's not in the wrong, but maybe could have approached it more sensitively.\n"
