Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym for convenience, but the gym has a women-only section. The author is objecting because he feels it's sexist to pay the same fee but have access to less equipment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces in gyms. I know that some gyms offer women-only areas to create a safer or more comfortable environment for women. Maybe the rationale is to address issues like harassment or to encourage more women to work out. But from the author's perspective, paying full price for less access seems unfair.\n\nThe key point here is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. The author is drawing an analogy: if women are charged the same but can't use part of the gym, wouldn't that be sexist? The girlfriend counters that it's different for women, implying that the separate section serves a purpose. \n\nI should check if there's a legal aspect. In many places, gender-segregated facilities can be allowed under the guise of religious or cultural practices, or as private clubs. However, if the gym is a public place, they might be required to provide equal access unless there's a compelling reason. But the question here is more about moral and social expectations rather than legalities.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of equality. The author is arguing for equal treatment, which is a valid stance. But the girlfriend's position is that the separate section isn't about exclusion but about providing a specific environment. If the gym is charging the same fee regardless of sex, then men are effectively getting more for their money if the women-only section uses up some resources. However, the existence of the women-only section might be justified as a positive discrimination measure to encourage female participation in fitness, which is a societal issue.\n\nThe author's comparison might not hold because the context for women is different. The women-only section could be a way to address historical imbalances. The author is applying the same standard to both genders, but the girlfriend sees the policy as serving a different purpose. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for seeing this as sexist? It's possible that the author is misunderstanding the intent behind the women-only section. If the gym provides a full range of equipment in the mixed areas and the women-only section is just an additional feature, then the author might be correct in feeling that his access is being limited. However, if the women-only section is a separate offering and the mixed areas have enough equipment for everyone, then the author might be overreacting.\n\nBut the problem here is that the author is being asked to pay the same fee for less access. If the gym allows women to use part of the facility without the same access for men, that could be seen as discriminatory. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women suggests she sees the policy as necessary or beneficial for women, which the author isn't accepting.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the gym's structure. If the women-only section is a separate part and the mixed areas are sufficient, the author might be right to object. However, if the gym is providing a choice that serves a specific need for women, the author's concern might not be about discrimination but about personal preference. The answer hinges on whether the gym's policy is genuinely equal access with optional separate sections or if it's inherently unequal. Since the author is paying the same but getting less, his stance is about equal treatment, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about providing a safe space for women, which is also valid. The question is whether the author's objection is reasonable. Given that the author is being consistent in his application of the principle, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
