Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch gyms with his girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. He feels it's sexist because men can't use that part, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women and gets upset when he questions her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of a women-only section, which he sees as unfair since men are excluded from part of the facility despite paying the same. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women, implying that such spaces are necessary or justified. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, from his perspective, he's pointing out a potential inequality. If the gym offers a section that only women can use, but men can't, and they all pay the same, that could be seen as discriminatory. The logic is similar to historical gender-based restrictions where women had limited access to certain spaces, but now it's reversed. However, the context of why the women-only section exists might matter. Maybe it's intended to create a safe space for women to work out without feeling uncomfortable around men. \n\nBut the author's argument is about equal access. If both genders pay the same but have unequal access to facilities, that's a problem of equity. The girlfriend might see the women-only section as a positive aspect, providing a space where women can feel more comfortable, which is a valid point. However, the author is concerned about fairness. \n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could agree to use the gym together in the areas both can access and avoid the women-only section. But he's not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is important for her, which is also valid. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory. If the gym is providing a service (women-only section) that the author isn't being charged for but can't use, it's a form of unequal access. However, if the gym is offering different options, and the author is free to use the rest of the gym, then maybe the issue is more about personal preference. \n\nBut the author's argument is that by charging the same fee for equal access, it's unfair. That's a valid point. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might stem from the idea that such spaces are necessary for women's comfort and safety, which is a common argument in favor of women-only facilities. However, the author is highlighting the asymmetry in access. \n\nSo, is the author the asshole? It depends on perspective. If the author is being confrontational about it, maybe. But if he's genuinely concerned about the inequity, then he's not wrong. The girlfriend might be in a position where she values the women-only section, but the author is also valid in his concern about equal access. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's raising a legitimate issue about equality and access. The gym's policy could be seen as discriminatory if it restricts access based on gender without justification. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also valid if the women-only section serves a purpose like safety or comfort. But the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inequality.\n"
