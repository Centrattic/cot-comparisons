Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend suggesting they both go to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The main issue is the gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author doesn't want to switch gyms because they feel it's sexist to pay the same fee but not have access to that section. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women. The question is if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the facts. The gym charges the same for men and women but has a women-only section. The author argues that men pay for the full gym but can't access a part of it. The girlfriend counters that it's different for women. The author is comparing it to women being excluded from certain spaces, which might be a reference to historical gender disparities.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the idea of equal access for equal price. If a gym charges the same but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, the context of the women-only section is likely intended to create a safe space for women, which might be why the girlfriend is defending it. The author is equating the two sides, but the girlfriend points out that the experiences of each gender are different. \n\nI should consider whether the author's argument is valid. If the gym's policy is to provide a women-only area, but charges men the same, that could be problematic. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in treatment. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps valuing the safety or comfort of women in that section. \n\nIs the author being sexist? The author is criticizing the gym's policy, which could be seen as fair if the policy is inherently discriminatory. But maybe the author is not considering the reasons behind the women-only section. However, the core issue is about equal access and pricing. If the gym is charging men the same as women but denying them access to a portion of the facility, that seems like a legitimate concern for the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the women-only section because it's important for women's comfort or safety. The author's analogy about women being charged the same but forbidden from using a portion of the gym is a valid point. If that were the case for women, it would be discriminatory. Therefore, the author's argument is logically consistent. \n\nSo, the author isn't being the asshole here. They are pointing out a possible inconsistency in the gym's policy. The girlfriend's upset might be because she values the women-only section, but the author's concern about equal treatment is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
