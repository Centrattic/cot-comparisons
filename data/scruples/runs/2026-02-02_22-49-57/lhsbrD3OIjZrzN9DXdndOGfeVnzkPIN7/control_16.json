Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend both work out at different gyms. She suggests he switch to hers for convenience. The issue is that her gym has a women-only area, which takes up a portion of the space and equipment. The author feels it's sexist because he'd pay the same fee but have less access. His girlfriend argues it's different for women.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for objecting. To figure this out, I need to consider perspectives on gender equality and access. The author's point is about fairness\u2014paying for the same membership but having restricted access. From his side, it's a logical argument. If you pay the same, you should have access to all facilities. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be supporting women's access to a safe space. The women-only section could be intended to provide a comfortable environment for women, which addresses historical disparities in gym access and comfort. But the author sees this as a form of discrimination against men, since they can't use that area despite paying the same. \n\nI need to consider if the author's objection is valid. The argument about equality is that both genders should have equal access. However, the existence of a women-only section might be a response to past issues where women felt unwelcome or unsafe. It's possible that the gym is trying to create a more inclusive environment for women, even if it means some men feel excluded. \n\nBut if the gym is charging men the same fee without giving them access to all areas, isn't that discrimination against men? The author's point is that it's inconsistent. If the gym allows women to have a section where men can't go, but doesn't allow men to have the same privilege, that's unequal treatment. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's argument that it's \"different for women\" might stem from societal contexts where women have had less access to such spaces. The key here is whether the policy is justified as a form of affirmative action or if it's inherently discriminatory. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author is unreasonable. If he's trying to understand her perspective but still holds his ground on the principle of equal access, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's dismissing her need for a women-only space, that could be seen as not considering her viewpoint. \n\nThe girlfriend's upset reaction suggests that she feels his objection is trivializing her need, which might be valid. The author's analogy about women being charged the same but forbidden to use part of the gym is a valid point, but it might not account for the context of why the women-only section exists. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author is pointing out a logical inconsistency (equal pay for unequal access), while the girlfriend is advocating for a space that addresses historical and ongoing issues for women. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the policy is seen as legitimate. If the policy is justified as creating a safe space, then the author's objection might be seen as not understanding that context. But if the policy is indeed discriminatory, then the author's stance is reasonable. \n\nGiven that the gym allows a women-only section as a means to support women's comfort and access, the author's refusal to switch might be seen as missing the point. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being wrong, but I'm a bit torn. However, the key is that the author is making a logical argument while the girlfriend is dealing with the practical needs of her community. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because his reasoning is based on equal treatment, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. \n\nWait, but the question is about whether the author is the asshole (in the wrong). The AITA subreddit often considers intent and understanding. If the author is trying to be fair but the girlfriend's need is also valid, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is not considering the reason behind the women-only section, maybe he is. \n\nI think the answer here is B (author not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a logical inconsistency in terms of equal access and payment. The gym's policy might be intended to help women, but from the author's perspective, it's an unfair restriction. Unless the policy is legally mandated or part of a broader effort to address past inequities, which isn't specified here, the author's objection is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
