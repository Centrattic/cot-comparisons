Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author's girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a \"women only\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for everyone, but this section is exclusively for women. The author objects because if they go to that gym, he would effectively pay full price but only have access to 75% of the equipment and space, while the women there would get 25% for free. The girlfriend gets upset when the author points out the inconsistency, saying it's different for women.\n\nThe key issue here is the author's objection to the gender-based segregation in the gym. The author is arguing that it's unfair for men to pay the same amount and have less access to equipment and space, while women have a dedicated section. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to accept this arrangement as something that's just different for women, perhaps due to societal norms or the intention of the gym to provide a safe space for women.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is based on the principle of equal treatment. If the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if a gym restricted women's access similarly, the girlfriend would likely object. The author is applying the same logic to both genders here. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response suggests that she might be under the impression that such segregation is justified in some way, maybe for safety or to encourage women to work out in a space where they feel more comfortable. But the author is arguing that this is a form of sexism because it's imposing a different standard on men without justification. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, gender-based restrictions in services (like gyms) are generally considered discriminatory unless there's a legitimate reason that overrides the principle of equal access. The gym's policy here might be intended to support women, but it inadvertently creates an unequal situation for men. The author's objection is about the principle of fairness and equal treatment. \n\nSo, the author isn't being the asshole here. He's raising a valid point about the inconsistency and potential discrimination in the gym's policy. The girlfriend's dismissal of his concerns as being \"stupid\" and her inability to see the issue from his perspective might indicate a lack of understanding of gender equality principles. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
