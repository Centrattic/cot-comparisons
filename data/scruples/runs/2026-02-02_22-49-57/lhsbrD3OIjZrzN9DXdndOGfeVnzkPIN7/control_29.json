Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. The key points here are the concept of equality and whether the situation is comparable.\n\nThe author argues that it's sexist because men are charged the same but can't use the women-only area, which is a quarter of the gym. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as different for women, maybe because of historical context or safety. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the principle of equal access. If the gym provides a women-only section, it's likely to offer a space where women feel comfortable and safe. However, the cost structure here is the same for both genders. If men pay the same fee but have restricted access to part of the facility, that seems unequal. The author is pointing out a discrepancy where the same price doesn't grant the same access, which could be seen as discriminatory against men.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective might be that women's only spaces are necessary for their comfort and safety, which is a valid point. However, the crux is whether denying men access to a portion of the gym (which is 25% of the equipment and area) is fair when they pay the same. If the gym charges the same fee but limits access based on sex, that's a form of gender-based discrimination unless there's a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.\n\nThe author's analogy is sound: if the roles were reversed, and the gym charged women the same but restricted their access to 75% of the equipment, that would be clearly discriminatory. The author is applying the same standard here, so it's a matter of consistency. The girlfriend's dismissal of the analogy suggests she might not see the issue symmetrically, but the principle of equal treatment should apply regardless of gender.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The gym's policy, as described, does create unequal access based on sex, which is a form of discrimination. The girlfriend's stance that it's \"different for women\" might stem from a belief in the necessity of women-only spaces, but that doesn't negate the fact that the policy is unequal for men in terms of access for the same fee. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
