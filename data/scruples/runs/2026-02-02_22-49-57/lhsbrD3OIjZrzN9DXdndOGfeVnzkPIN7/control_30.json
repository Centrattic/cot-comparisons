Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section, and the author is uncomfortable joining because they think it's sexist. The key points here are about fairness and equality.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but women have access to a section that men can't use. The author is saying that if he pays the same, he should have access to all the equipment. That seems logical from a fairness standpoint. If someone pays full price but is excluded from part of the facility, that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThen, the girlfriend responds by saying it's different for women, which might imply that she thinks the women-only section is justified. The author questions her by asking if she would accept the reverse situation, which is a classic way to highlight inconsistency. The girlfriend gets upset, saying the author doesn't understand. \n\nThe core issue here is whether gender-based restrictions in a commercial setting are acceptable. If the gym offers a women-only area, it's likely for reasons like safety or comfort, which are common in other public spaces. However, the author's argument is that paying the same fee without equal access is unfair. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, in some places, gender discrimination in services could be an issue, but gyms might have exceptions for women-only areas if they are justified. However, the author's main point is about the fairness of the fee structure, not necessarily about the existence of the women-only section itself. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the problem, possibly because she benefits from the women-only section and doesn't consider the reverse scenario. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in her stance. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to go to a gym that excludes him from part of the facilities based on gender. The answer hinges on whether it's unfair to be charged equally but have restricted access. The author's reasoning seems valid, so they might not be the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
