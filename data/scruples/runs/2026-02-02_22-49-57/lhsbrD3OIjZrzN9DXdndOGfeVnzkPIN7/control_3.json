Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points here are about the gym having a women-only section and the author's objection to that.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that the gym charges the same fee for both men and women, but women have access to a section that men can't use. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of paying the same price but not being able to use a part of the facility. They also question if their girlfriend would accept the reverse situation, which she says is different for women. \n\nI need to consider the reasoning from both sides. The author is pointing out a discrepancy in access based on gender, which they see as sexist. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might believe that the women-only section is meant to create a safe space for women, so she thinks the comparison isn't valid. \n\nLegally, in many places, gender-segregated spaces can exist if they are voluntary, especially if there's a safety or comfort aspect. However, the author's perspective is that the gym is essentially providing unequal access without a valid reason, which they find discriminatory. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way. If the gym is charging the same but limiting access, the author isn't necessarily wrong to find that unfair. But maybe the girlfriend's reasoning is about safety or empowerment, which is a different perspective. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's objection is valid. Since the author is highlighting a potential inconsistency in treatment based on sex, they might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see the issue the same way, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The situation is about differing values\u2014equal access versus safe spaces. The author's stance is about fairness and equal treatment, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
