Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they both use her gym for convenience. The main issue is that the gym has a women-only section, and the author objects because he feels it's discriminatory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the problem. The gym charges the same fee for both men and women but has a section that only women can use. The author argues that he's paying the same but can't access that part, which he perceives as sexist. The girlfriend defends the women-only section, saying it's different for women, and the author is upset that she doesn't see his perspective.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author's stance is that the gym is unfair because it restricts his access based on gender, even though it's a separate section. The girlfriend's side is that the women-only section exists for women's needs, like privacy or comfort, which is a common reason for such spaces. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the gym isn't charging him less to access the entire facility, so he might not be wrong in feeling that he's paying for something he can't use. However, the women-only section might be a necessary service for women, similar to women's restrooms or changing rooms. The key here is whether the author is wrong for not accepting a policy that's intended to serve a specific need. \n\nIf the gym allows women to use a section exclusively, and the author is paying the same fee for the entire membership, then his objection is based on the principle of equal access. But if the women's section is a service provided to women, then it's not inherently discriminatory against men. It's a question of whether the gym is violating any anti-discrimination laws or if the author's perspective is about fairness versus the necessity of the women's section.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author is \"stupid\" and not understanding might be where the issue lies. However, the author's concern isn't baseless. If the gym allows women to use a part that's not available to men, and there's no comparable section for men, that could be seen as gender-based. But if the women's section is for their comfort and the gym is otherwise accessible, then the author's objection is more about personal principle. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym isn't violating any laws and the women's section is a service they offer, then the author's argument might be about a policy he doesn't agree with, but not necessarily wrong. However, if the gym's policy is discriminatory in a way that affects both genders unfairly, then the author might have a valid point. But given that the section is only for women and the gym allows it, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
