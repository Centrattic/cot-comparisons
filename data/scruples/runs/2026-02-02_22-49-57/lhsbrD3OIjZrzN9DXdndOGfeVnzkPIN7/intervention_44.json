Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for everyone, but the women-only section restricts men from using part of the equipment and space. The author argues that it's sexist to charge the same fee but limit access based on gender, while his girlfriend defends it as being different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is against the idea of a gym that charges everyone the same but restricts certain areas based on gender. His main argument is about fairness and equality. On the other hand, his girlfriend seems to be defending the women-only section, implying that it's a necessary or acceptable practice. The author's reasoning is that if the gym charges the same fee, men should have equal access to all facilities. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which the author finds frustrating.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and legal standards, gender-segregated spaces in gyms can be a sensitive topic. Some argue that women-only sections provide a safe environment for women to work out without feeling uncomfortable or intimidated. However, from a fairness perspective, if the gym is charging the same fee but offering unequal access, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: men pay the same but get less access, which is a valid concern from an equality standpoint.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, where she accuses the author of being stupid and says it's different for women, might indicate a lack of understanding or a different perspective. The author is trying to highlight the potential sexism in the policy, which is a reasonable concern. The question here is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to support a gym that enforces such a policy. \n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the author is not in the wrong for holding the gym to the standard of equal access for all paying customers. If the gym were to implement a policy where men could use the entire facility but women couldn't, the author would likely find that discriminatory. Therefore, his stance is consistent with principles of fairness and equality. The girlfriend's argument that it's different for women might be based on a belief that such spaces are beneficial for women, but that doesn't negate the author's point about the inequity in access relative to the fee.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's position is about advocating for equal treatment and recognizing the inconsistency in the gym's policy. Therefore, the answer should be B, as the author is not in the wrong.\n"
