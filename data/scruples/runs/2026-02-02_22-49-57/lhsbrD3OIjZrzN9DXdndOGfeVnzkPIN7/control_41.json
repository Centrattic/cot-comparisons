Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend both work out. She suggests they both go to her gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which is a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author argues that since the entrance fee is the same for everyone, but men can't use that section, it's unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, hence the author is the asshole.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, we need to consider the fairness and the societal context.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender, it's discriminatory. He's pointing out a logical inconsistency: if a man had to pay full price but couldn't use a quarter of the gym, he'd be upset. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section is for their benefit, perhaps to create a safe space or to encourage more women to exercise without feeling uncomfortable around men.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the author's argument is valid. The gym is charging the same amount but not providing equal access to all areas. That does seem like a form of gender-based discrimination. However, the context might be that the women-only section exists to address historical underrepresentation of women in gyms, providing a more comfortable environment. But does that justify the exclusion of men?\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for objecting to this policy. If the gym is a private business, they can set their own rules, but if the policy is discriminatory, it could be legally questionable. However, the author's issue is more about principle rather than legality. The girlfriend might be used to the system and not see the problem, thinking it's for women's benefit. The author is challenging the fairness of the policy, which is a reasonable stance. So, the author might not be in the wrong because he's pointing out a potential fairness issue. However, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is necessary, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. If the author is acting based on a valid principle of fairness, even if the girlfriend disagrees, he might not be the asshole. The girlfriend's response of calling him stupid and getting upset could indicate she's not open to discussion, which might shift the blame. However, the author's initial stance is logically sound. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
