Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend both work out and have been going to different gyms before they met. Now the girlfriend wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is upset because he's paying the same fee but can't use the women-only area, which he sees as sexist. The girlfriend thinks he's being stupid and says it's different for women. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of equal access. If the gym charges the same for everyone but restricts access to a section based on gender, that seems like a form of discrimination. The author is pointing out an inequality in what each gender gets for their money. If he's paying full price but can't use 25% of the equipment and space, that's not equal access. Similarly, if the women were charged less because they can't use the men's section, that would also be an issue. But here, the charge is the same, so the problem is the access.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which might be a justification based on historical or current gender disparities in certain spaces, like gyms where women might feel uncomfortable or unsafe in mixed environments. Some gyms offer women-only sections to encourage female participation by providing a safer or more welcoming space. However, the author's perspective is that this setup is inherently unfair because it creates an unequal experience for men, even if the intention is to support women.\n\nThe key question is whether the gender-based restriction is justified. From a fairness standpoint, if the gym is providing the same service but with restricted access based on sex, that could be considered discriminatory. However, if the women-only section is a service specifically marketed to women, perhaps as a niche offering, then it's a different case. But the way it's explained here, the gym is charging everyone the same but denying men access to a portion of the facility based on their gender, which seems like a clear case of unequal treatment unless there's a legal or policy-based reason (like separate facilities for hygiene or safety).\n\nThe author's argument that it's sexist is valid because it's about unequal access. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might be based on her personal experience or societal norms, but that doesn't negate the author's valid point about fairness. The situation is a bit of a clash between different perspectives on equality and gender-specific needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inequality. The gym's policy is the root issue here. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the women-only section, but the author's stance is about receiving equal value for his membership. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
