Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend wants them to switch to the same gym, but that gym has a \"women only\" section. The author objects because they feel it's sexist to pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment if they were women. The girlfriend thinks the author is being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is justified in their objection. The key issue here is gender-based segregation in a gym. The author is arguing that it's unfair to charge everyone the same but restrict access based on gender. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is defending the women-only section, implying it's necessary for women.\n\nI should consider the concept of equal treatment. If the gym is charging the same fee regardless of access, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, women-only spaces are often created to address safety concerns or to provide environments where women feel more comfortable. But from the author's perspective, if they can't access all areas, it's a form of unequal treatment. \n\nBut the author is male, so he's not the one being excluded. The problem arises when he's being asked to pay for a facility that has a segregated section. The author's argument is about fairness and equal access. However, the existence of the women-only section isn't necessarily discriminatory if it's optional for women and doesn't restrict men's access to other parts. The author is objecting because he perceives it as sexist, but maybe he's not seeing the rationale behind such sections.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" could be pointing out that women may need such spaces for various reasons, like safety, which men don't typically face in the same way. The author's analogy\u2014if the situation were reversed and women were restricted\u2014might not fully capture the different experiences between genders. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If the gym is not restricting men's access beyond the women-only section and the author can use the remaining 75%, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author is paying the same fee as someone who can use all areas, that could be an issue. However, the existence of a women-only section isn't inherently sexist; it's a choice for women to have a space where they feel safe or comfortable. The author's refusal might be based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of such sections. Therefore, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're standing up for equal treatment, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid given the context. However, since the author is not being restricted in his access (as a man), his objection might be misplaced. \n\nWait, the gym has a women-only section, but the author is a man, so he can't use that part. But he's paying the same as women who can use the entire gym. That seems like a problem. If a woman pays the same fee but can access more, that's unequal. But the author is not being excluded from anything beyond the women-only section. So if the gym is structured so that men can use all areas except the women-only part, then the author is not being discriminated against. But if women are paying the same as men but can access more, that would be the issue. \n\nWait, the user says the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but the women-only section is part of the gym. So, women can access the entire gym, including their own section, while men can only access the other 75%? Wait no, the author's girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. So women can use that section and the rest? No, the user says the women-only section is part of the gym, so women can use the entire gym. Or is the women-only section separate? The description says the gym has a women-only section, which is 1/4 of the area and equipment. So, the rest of the gym is co-ed or open to all. Therefore, women can use the entire gym, but men can't use the women-only section. So the author, as a man, can't use the women-only section, but women can use all areas. Therefore, women are getting access to more of the facility, but the fees are the same. So the author is objecting because if he were a woman, he'd be paying the same but have access to more. But since he's a man, he's not being excluded from anything except the women-only part. The problem is that women can use more, so they're getting more value for the same price. The author is drawing an analogy, but in reality, the situation is different because women are not being restricted from anything. The author's analogy is flawed because if the situation were reversed, men could still use the entire gym, but women would have a section they can't use. But that's not the case here. The women can use all, and men can't use part. Therefore, the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding. The women-only section is for women's benefit, and it's not restricting men's access to the rest. Therefore, the author is being sexist because he's equating the two and not considering the reasons for the women-only section. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure. The key here is whether the gym is structured so that women have more access. If the entrance fee is the same, but women can use more, then it's not equal. But the gym might have different pricing structures, but the user says the fee is the same. Therefore, the author is correct in pointing out that it's unequal. However, the existence of the women-only section isn't inherently sexist if it's for safety reasons. The author is not being excluded from anything as a man, so his objection is about a hypothetical scenario where he would be a woman. The author's argument is that it's sexist because it's unequal access based on sex. But the girlfriend is defending it. The author is not in the wrong if he's standing up against unequal treatment, but if the gym's structure is just for women's benefit and not discriminatory against men, then maybe the author is overreacting. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the gym is not restricting men's access beyond the women-only section, then the author isn't being discriminated against. Therefore, his objection is based on a hypothetical where he would be a woman, but that doesn't change the current situation. So the author is not in the wrong because he's pointing out a possible inequality. But some might argue that the women-only section is a legitimate choice for women, and the author's objection is unnecessary. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's advocating for equal treatment. However, others might say that the author is missing the point that the women-only section is for women's benefit and not against men. This is a bit complex. The key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. Since the author can use the other 75%, and women can use all, but the fees are the same, the author's argument is that it's unequal. However, the existence of a women-only section isn't necessarily discriminatory in itself, especially if it's for safety or comfort. The author's analogy may not hold because the scenarios are not symmetrical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering the rationale behind the women-only section and is making an incorrect analogy. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B because the author is standing up for equality. I need to check the standard AITA analysis. In AITA threads, sometimes the person is called out for not understanding the context. Here, the girlfriend is saying it's different for women, implying that the women-only section is necessary. The author's argument is that if the roles were reversed, it would be sexist, but he's not recognizing that the situation isn't symmetrical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
