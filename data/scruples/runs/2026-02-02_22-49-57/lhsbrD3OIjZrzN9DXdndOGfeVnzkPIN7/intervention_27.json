Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a guy who doesn't want to join his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section, which he finds sexist. The gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access to part of the facility based on sex.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the gym has a women-only section, which the author finds discriminatory. He argues that charging the same fee but limiting access based on gender is unfair. His girlfriend thinks he's overreacting and says it's different for women.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, gender-specific spaces are allowed, especially in contexts like gyms where they might provide a more comfortable environment for women. However, if the gym is charging equal fees but limiting access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author's argument is that he's being treated unfairly because he can't access all the equipment, which might be a form of gender discrimination from his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that these women-only sections are meant to support women, perhaps offering a safer or more comfortable space. But from the author's viewpoint, it's about equal access. If the gym is a for-profit entity and they're segmenting their customers without providing equal access to all, that could be a legal issue. However, if they're providing the same service (the entire gym access for the same price) but allowing women-only sections as an option, maybe it's not illegal, but is it ethically wrong?\n\nThe author is not forcing the gym to change its policies; he's just choosing not to participate. His reasoning is based on perceived inequality. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see it as discriminatory, which could be due to her understanding the women-only section as a positive initiative for women.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks not. I need to consider if his stance is valid. If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then his refusal is justified. But if the gym is within its rights to have such a section, then maybe his refusal is a personal choice. However, the author isn't objecting to the women-only section itself but to being charged equally for less access. That's a key point. If a man pays the same but can't use the same portion, that's a disparity. In many laws, such as in the US, Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment, but gyms are different. However, some states might have laws against gender discrimination in public accommodations. So, if the gym is violating the law, the author's stance is correct. If not, maybe his perception is misplaced.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not legal technicalities. The author is standing by his belief that it's sexist, which is a moral stance. His girlfriend's response indicates she doesn't see it that way, which is a difference in perspective. So, morally, the author isn't in the wrong if he believes it's discriminatory. However, if the gym's policy is permissible and not actually discriminatory, then maybe his stance is not justified. But without legal context, on a moral level, he's making a case for equality, which is a valid position. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
