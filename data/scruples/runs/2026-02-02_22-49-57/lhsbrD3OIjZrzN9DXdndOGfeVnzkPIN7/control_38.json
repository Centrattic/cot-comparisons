Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a \"women only\" section. The author's main argument is that paying full price but only having access to 75% of the equipment is sexist. His girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The gym charges the same fee for both men and women, but women have access to a women-only section which is a quarter of the gym. The author objects to being excluded from that section, considering it unfair. The girlfriend counters that it's different for women, perhaps implying that the women-only section is necessary for their comfort or safety.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author is upset because he's paying the same but can't use all the equipment. From his perspective, this seems like a price discrimination issue. If the gym allows a section exclusive to one gender, but everyone pays the same, he's not getting the full value. But is that a valid point?\n\nOn the other hand, the women-only section might exist for specific reasons. Many gyms have such areas to provide a safe space for women, which can be important due to issues like harassment or feeling uncomfortable. The author might be missing the context that the women-only section is a positive feature, not a discriminatory one. His girlfriend's frustration could stem from his not understanding the rationale behind the section.\n\nThe author's comparison asks if his girlfriend would accept a scenario where she can't use part of the gym. That's a reasonable question, but the response might be that the need for the women-only section is due to societal issues not present for men. So, the two situations aren't symmetrical.\n\nLegally, in many places, allowing single-sex spaces is permitted, especially if they're for health, safety, or privacy reasons. The gym isn't necessarily violating any laws by having the women-only section. So, from a legal standpoint, the gym isn't being sexist, but maybe the author's perspective is missing the intent behind the section.\n\nEthically, the author is objecting to a policy that others find beneficial. His stance could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's needs or the reasons why the gym has that section. If the author's main issue is the fairness of the fee, maybe he should be content with paying the same and having access to the rest, while women have their own space. Alternatively, if the gym charges based on the total available facilities, but restricts access, the author's point could have merit. However, the presence of the women-only section might be a separate issue that serves a different purpose.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author isn't acknowledging the necessity of the women-only section and is instead focusing on the fee, he might be missing the point. His girlfriend's frustration (\"I just don't understand\") suggests that she feels he can't see her perspective. The author's comparison is valid in terms of fairness, but the underlying reasons for the women-only section might not be about discrimination against men but about addressing women's needs in a male-dominated environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of his reasoning about the fee, but he might be misunderstanding the purpose of the women-only section. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the issue is more about the need for safe spaces rather than just fairness in fees. Therefore, the author's position isn't necessarily wrong, but he could benefit from understanding the context better. Hence, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
