Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. The girlfriend wants to switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section. The author objects because the gym charges the same fee for everyone, but men can only access 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting, saying it's different for women.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is about equal access for the same price. If you pay the same as everyone else, you should have access to all the facilities. The girlfriend argues that it's okay for women to have a separate section, implying that the author's concern is misplaced. \n\nThis seems like a classic case of unequal treatment based on sex. The gym is charging men and women the same but restricting access to certain areas. That's a form of discrimination, right? The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if a gym charges the same fee but restricts access by sex, that's unfair. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be based on the idea that women need safe spaces, which is valid, but from the author's perspective, it's still unfair because he's paying the same for less access.\n\nBut wait, maybe the \"women only\" section is for safety or to encourage female participation in gyms where they might feel uncomfortable otherwise. In that case, the gym might have a legitimate reason. But the key issue here is whether the gym is providing equal value for the same price. If men can't use a quarter of the equipment, they're effectively paying more per unit of equipment. That's a real issue of equity.\n\nThe author isn't attacking the existence of the women's section itself, but the fact that he's being charged the same as women but can't use all the facilities. The girlfriend's response that the author is being stupid and not understanding suggests she doesn't see the problem from his viewpoint. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym is providing a service that's not available to all members equally despite equal pricing, then the author has a valid complaint. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for dismissing his concerns. However, if the women's section is a necessary accommodation to address historical underrepresentation or safety issues, then it's a more nuanced situation. But the author's issue is about equal access, not about supporting or opposing the women's section. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if two people pay the same but have different access based on sex, that's discriminatory. The author's argument is about equal access for equal price, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's refusal to see it as such might make her the one not understanding. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
