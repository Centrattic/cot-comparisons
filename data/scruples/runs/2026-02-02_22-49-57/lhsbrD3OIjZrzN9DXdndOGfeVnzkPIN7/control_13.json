Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms with his girlfriend because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She wants them to go to the same gym, but her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is upset because, if he goes there, he can't use that section, so he feels like he's paying full price for less access. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable, saying it's different for women.\n\nThe key points here are about equality in access. The author is paying the same fee but has restricted access to parts of the gym. If the gym allowed men to use the entire facility, including the women-only section, then there wouldn't be an issue. But since there's a section that's only for women, men can't use it, which reduces their available space and equipment. The author is pointing out that this seems like a form of discrimination, because he's being excluded from part of the facility based on his gender.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" is interesting. Maybe she believes that the women-only section provides a safe space or addresses historical imbalances where women might feel uncomfortable working out in a co-ed environment. However, the argument from the author is that if the gym charges the same price to both genders, but restricts access for men, that's a form of sexism. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, having women-only sections can be seen as promoting inclusivity and safety for women, especially if they feel more comfortable there. On the other hand, if members of the opposite sex are being charged the same amount but can't access the same resources, that's a problem of equal access. The author is being consistent by pointing out that if he were a woman and faced similar restrictions, he would be upset. The girlfriend's frustration might come from not seeing the inconsistency or from differing values on what's acceptable.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the gym's policy is to charge everyone the same but restrict access based on gender, then the author is highlighting a potential issue of unequal treatment. The girlfriend might not see it that way, perhaps valuing the benefits of the women-only section for her own experience. But from a fairness perspective, the author's argument is valid. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
