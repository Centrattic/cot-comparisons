Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for not wanting to join his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend go to different gyms. She wants them to switch to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is her gym has a women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but women can use that section, which has a quarter of the equipment and space. The author objects because if they charged the same, he feels like he's paying full price but getting access to less. He brings up a hypothetical where he asks if she would go to a gym that charged her the same but restricted her access, which makes her upset and she says he's not understanding.\n\nSo the key points here are about fairness and perception of equality. The author's argument is that if the gym charges everyone the same, but offers a section that only one gender can use, it's discriminatory. He's pointing out the inconsistency: why should he pay full price if part of the facility is off-limits to him based on his gender. His girlfriend, on the other hand, might see the women-only section as a positive, perhaps providing a safe space for women to work out without male presence, which is a common argument for such sections. But she's struggling to see why her stance would mean the author is being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, the gym's policy does seem discriminatory. If both genders pay the same but have unequal access, that's a problem. The author is highlighting a logical inconsistency. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about creating a safe space for women, which is a different value. The author isn't opposing the women-only section per se, but is objecting to the equality of access and pricing. \n\nThe gym's policy might be legal, but that doesn't make it fair. The author is standing by his belief that equal pricing should mean equal access. The girlfriend is defending the policy as necessary for women, hence the conflict. The author isn't trying to exclude women; he's trying to point out the unfairness from his side. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling that her needs (safe space) are more important than the author's access. But the author's position is about fairness in exchange for the fee.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If we consider that the gym's policy is discriminatory, then the author is right to point out the inconsistency. He's not the one being unreasonable here. His argument is based on equal treatment. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author isn't in the wrong for raising this issue. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
