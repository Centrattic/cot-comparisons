Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy doesn't want to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same for both men and women, but the women's section is a quarter of the gym and has a quarter of the equipment. The guy argues that it's sexist because if he went there, he'd pay full price but not be allowed to use all the equipment. His girlfriend thinks he's not understanding that it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In many places, especially in some cultures, women-only gyms or sections are created to provide a safe space where women feel more comfortable, maybe because of harassment or feeling uncomfortable being around men. So the gym's intention might be to support women's comfort and safety, not to discriminate against men. \n\nBut the guy's argument is about equal access. If the gym is charging the same price but restricting access based on gender, from a fairness perspective, he might feel it's unfair. But is it actually discriminatory? If the gym is providing a service (the women's section) that's optional and not forcing men to use it, then maybe it's not discriminatory. However, if the structure is such that men are excluded from a portion of the gym without any reciprocal benefit, it could be seen as a form of unequal treatment. \n\nBut wait, maybe the women's section is a separate service. If men can only access the rest of the gym and not the women-only part, but the rest is still a valid portion, then perhaps the gym is offering different options. The problem arises when the gym is charging the same rate as the full access but men are excluded from part of the facilities. That seems like a service that's not fully utilizing the paid access, which could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the social aspect. The guy doesn't want to go to the same gym because of this policy. His girlfriend might feel that this is an unnecessary conflict, especially if the women's section is for her comfort. The guy is prioritizing his principles over the relationship benefit (carpooling, working out together). The girlfriend's frustration comes from not seeing his perspective, and he's upset she doesn't get his point.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many countries, gender-segregated spaces can be legal if they serve a specific purpose, like safety or comfort, and if there's equal access to other parts. So the gym isn't necessarily violating any laws. However, the guy's perception is that it's unfair, which is a values-based issue. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym isn't violating any laws or ethical standards, and the women's section is a choice for women, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if the gym is charging the same for men but limiting their access to certain areas, that could be seen as a form of discrimination. However, the key here is that the women's section is a separate service. If men can use the rest of the gym, even if it's 75%, then maybe it's not discriminatory. \n\nBut the problem is the framing. The guy is saying that he pays for the whole gym but can't use part of it. If the gym's pricing is based on the entire facility, then excluding a portion for men could be seen as not providing the full service expected for the price. However, if the pricing is based on the non-segregated areas plus the access to the women's section (which they can't use), then it's a problem. But maybe the gym's pricing is for the entire facility, but the women's section is an added benefit for women, not a standard part for everyone. \n\nSo, the author's argument is that he's being charged for the full gym but can't access the women's section. However, the rest of the gym is still available. If the gym is structured to have a women's section as a separate part, then the guy is still getting access to most of the gym. The issue is whether he's being treated unfairly by not being allowed into the women's section, which is intended for women. \n\nIn this case, the gym isn't forcing men to pay for a service they can't use. The women's section is an option for women, and men can use the rest. The guy's problem is that he's not willing to accept that structure because he thinks it's sexist. But the existence of a women-only section isn't inherently sexist; it's about providing a space for women. \n\nTherefore, the author might be misunderstanding the purpose of the women's section. He's equating his inability to access that area with discrimination, but the gym isn't denying him access to the majority of the facility. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might stem from her understanding of the necessity for such spaces. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of his values, but he might be in the wrong in how he's framing the issue. The gym's policy isn't discriminatory if it's providing equal access to the rest of the gym for men. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concern is about fairness, and the gym's policy isn't illegal, but the situation is more about differing perspectives rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
