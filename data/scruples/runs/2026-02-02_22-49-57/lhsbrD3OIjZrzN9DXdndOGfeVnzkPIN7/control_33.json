Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is right or wrong here. The situation is about whether it's sexist for a gym to have a women-only section that men can't use, even though both genders pay the same fee. The author is upset because his girlfriend's gym has this section, and he doesn't want to join because he thinks it's unfair. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of allowing women to use a separate section while men are excluded. He argues that since both pay the same, it's like men are paying for access to a smaller portion of the facilities. His girlfriend defends it by saying \"it's different for women,\" implying that the women-only section serves a purpose, maybe for women's comfort or safety.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym charges the same fee regardless of gender but restricts access to certain areas based on sex, that could be seen as discriminatory. Discrimination isn't just about treating people worse; it's also about treating them unequally when there's no justifiable reason. However, sometimes single-sex spaces are justified for reasons like safety, privacy, or comfort. For example, women-only gyms or sections might exist to provide a safer environment, which could be a valid reason. But if the gym is co-ed overall but has a separate section that's only for women, then men aren't being excluded entirely, just from part of the facility.\n\nThe author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women would be upset if men had a similar section that excluded them. That's a common way to check for bias\u2014applying the same standard to both sides. If the gym had a men-only section that women couldn't use, and both paid the same, that would likely be seen as discriminatory. So the author's point is that the same logic should apply here. However, his girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which is a common counter-argument in discussions about gender-specific policies.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical standards. In many places, discrimination based on gender is prohibited in public accommodations, which includes gyms. If the gym is providing different access based on sex without a legitimate reason, it could be considered discriminatory. But if there's a legitimate reason, like safety, then it might be allowed. However, if the gym is already co-ed in most parts and only a quarter is women-only, maybe the justification is weaker compared to a fully women-only gym.\n\nThe author's main issue is about being excluded from a portion of the facility because of his gender. If he's paying the same fee, he might feel he's not getting the same value. However, his girlfriend might see the women-only section as a necessary feature for female members, hence not seeing the problem from his perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then he's justified in his stance. If the policy is legitimate, then his objection might not hold. But since the question is about social judgment (AITA), it's also influenced by societal norms and perceptions. Many people might see the women-only section as a positive feature for women, so the author's refusal to join might be seen as not understanding the need for such spaces. On the other hand, others might agree with the author that equal access is important.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the issue is whether the gym's policy is justified. If the women-only section is for safety or comfort, then excluding men there could be reasonable. But if the gym charges equally without restrictions, then excluding one gender from part of the facility without a valid reason could be discriminatory. The author's analogy of asking his girlfriend if she'd accept a similar policy for men is a good one. If she wouldn't, then the policy is double-standard.\n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether the gym's policy is legally and ethically justified. If it's justified, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting it. If not, then he's justified. However, since the scenario doesn't provide enough legal context, it's more about social norms. In some cultures, women-only spaces are accepted, so the author's objection might be seen as not empathetic. In others, where equality is strictly enforced, his stance makes sense.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because he's pointing out a potential double standard. His girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as \"stupid\" suggests she isn't considering his valid point. The key is that if the gym allows women to have a separate area but doesn't offer a similar option for men, it's creating an unequal experience. The author's refusal to join is about seeking equal treatment, which is a reasonable stance.\n"
