Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to the same gym as his girlfriend because of the \"women only\" section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend wants them to go to her gym for carpooling and working out together. The issue is that the gym has a section that's exclusively for women, which takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The man feels it's sexist because he's paying the same fee but can't use that section. The girlfriend thinks he doesn't understand and that it's different for women.\n\nSo, the key points here are about gender-based segregation in a public space and perceived fairness. The man is objecting to a policy that he sees as discriminatory in the opposite direction. The woman is defending the policy as necessary for women's comfort and safety.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The man's argument is about equal access and fairness\u2014since he's paying the same, he should have access to all areas. The woman's side is that women-only spaces are important for their safety and comfort, which is a common argument for separate spaces in gyms, locker rooms, etc.\n\nIs the man in the wrong for not wanting to support a policy he finds sexist? Or is he not in the wrong because he's standing up against a discriminatory policy that he perceives as such? The girlfriend's reaction might be because she sees the women-only section as necessary and the man is challenging that. \n\nBut the question is whether the man is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the policy is actually discriminatory to him. If the gym allows a women-only section, it's a form of gender segregation, which can be a point of debate. In some contexts, such segregation is considered discriminatory, but in others, it's seen as a necessary measure for women's rights and safety. The man's stance is that it's sexist because he's excluded from a part where others his sex are excluded. However, the argument for women-only spaces often centers on the opposite problem\u2014women being excluded or feeling uncomfortable in co-ed spaces due to harassment or judgment.\n\nSo, if the man is objecting to the gym's policy, is he wrong? It might depend on the broader societal context. If the women-only section is intended to address existing inequalities and provide a safe space, then the man's objection might be seen as not understanding the rationale. On the other hand, if the gym is charging equal fees and the policy is truly segregating access without a justifiable reason, it could be seen as discriminatory towards men. But typically, women-only spaces are created to address the lack of such spaces for women in the past, not to discriminate against men.\n\nTherefore, the man's perspective might be rooted in a lack of understanding of why such spaces are necessary. The girlfriend is likely defending a policy that she sees as empowering for women. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's not recognizing the importance of such spaces for women, even if it means he personally feels it's unfair. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not understanding the context and needs behind the women-only section.\n"
