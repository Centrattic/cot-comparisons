Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because their girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The key points here are about fairness and perception.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a women-only section that excludes men. The author argues that it's unfair to pay full price for limited access. The girlfriend thinks it's acceptable and says the author doesn't understand. \n\nI need to consider the concept of equality. If the gym allows women-only spaces but doesn't restrict men's access, it's creating a sex-based division. The author's argument is that this is sexist because men can't use the same facilities. The girlfriend sees it as different treatment, not discrimination. \n\nBut wait, in many places, having single-sex spaces is legal and intended to address underrepresentation or safety concerns. However, if the gym is charging men the same but not allowing them access to certain areas, that could be seen as discriminatory from the men's perspective. \n\nThe author's stance is about equal access for all members. If they pay equally, they expect equal access. The girlfriend's response suggests she sees the women-only section as beneficial, which might be her way of feeling more comfortable or safe. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a matter of perspective. The author is highlighting a potential fairness issue, while the girlfriend values the existing structure. Legally and socially, single-sex spaces are allowed, but the author's refusal to comply with the arrangement might be seen as a valid stance if they feel they're being unfairly restricted. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're advocating for equal treatment, which is a reasonable perspective.\n"
