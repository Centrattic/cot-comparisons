Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym. The catch is that the gym has a women-only section, which the author finds sexist. The key point is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone, but men can't access a quarter of the equipment and area reserved for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that it's unfair to pay full price but only get access to 75% of the facilities because of their gender. That seems like a legitimate concern. If a service charges the same price but restricts access based on gender, that's a form of discrimination. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if the gym allows women to have a dedicated area, why can't men access the same? Charging equal fees but offering unequal access seems discriminatory from both perspectives.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that it's \"different for women.\" Maybe she believes that women-only spaces are necessary for comfort or safety, which is a common argument. Some women prefer such spaces to avoid harassment or feel more at ease. However, the author's counterpoint is valid in that the gym is charging men the same fee without offering equivalent access. The author is highlighting a double standard: women can have their exclusive area, but men aren't given the same option. This creates an imbalance where one gender has restricted access without compensation.\n\nThe gym's policy might be legal if it's considered a \"separate but equal\" provision, but in practice, separate isn't always equal. The author is not asking for access to the women's section, just equal access to the same facilities that men can use. The fact that the gym allows women to have a section that men can't use, while charging men full price for less access, is the core issue. The author isn't being sexist by pointing out this inequality; they're advocating for equal treatment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from not seeing the problem from the author's perspective. She might not realize that the policy affects the author's access as well. The author is trying to communicate that this policy is discriminatory not just in theory but in practice, as it limits their access proportionally to women's access. The gym's business model creates an unequal situation where each gender is restricted in terms of the other. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong here. They are identifying a legitimate issue of unequal access based on gender. The gym's policy is inherently discriminatory if it restricts access without providing equivalent benefits. The author isn't being unreasonable by pointing this out. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's concern doesn't negate the validity of the author's argument. So the answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
