Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend suggested they both switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that the gym has a \"women only\" section, which is a quarter of the gym and a quarter of the equipment. The author is uncomfortable with this because they think it's sexist. They argue that if the gym charges the same fee, why can't men use all the equipment? The girlfriend got upset and said it's different for women. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The author's main issue is about fairness and equal access. If the gym charges the same price but restricts access based on gender, that seems like a problem. It's like paying full price but not having access to all the amenities. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the women-only section as a space for women, which could be intended to provide a safer or more comfortable environment. This is a common practice in some gyms to address issues like harassment or lack of space. However, the gym is still charging the same fee to men, even though they can't use part of the facility. That seems like a problem because it's not a true women-only gym but has a section that's gender-restricted. \n\nLegally, in many places, public accommodations can't discriminate based on gender unless there's a specific reason, like a locker room. But here, it's a workout area. So the gym's policy might actually be discriminatory because they're charging men the same but excluding them from certain areas. The author is pointing out that if the gym were to reverse the situation, it would be unacceptable, which is a valid point.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" could be a form of justification for the unequal access, but the author is right to question that. It's a classic case of different treatment without a legitimate reason. The author isn't being sexist by opposing unequal access. They're advocating for equal treatment under the same terms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The gym's policy is the issue here, not the author's objection to it. The girlfriend might not be seeing the double standard, which is why she's upset. The author is justified in not wanting to support a gym that practices such discrimination, even if the intention behind the women-only section is to help women.\n"
