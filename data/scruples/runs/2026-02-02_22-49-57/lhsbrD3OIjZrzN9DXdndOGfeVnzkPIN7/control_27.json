Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue seems to be about gender equality and access to resources.\n\nSo, the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section reserved for women. The author argues that this is unfair because men can't use that section, effectively getting less value for their money. The girlfriend defends it by saying it's different for women. \n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they might feel that paying the same but having access to less equipment is discriminatory. They might see it as a form of sexism where women are given special provisions that they aren't getting for themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman's side could be that the women-only section exists to provide a safe and inclusive space for women in a traditionally male-dominated environment. Gyms can sometimes be intimidating for women, and such sections might encourage more women to exercise confidently. The reasoning here is that the need for such spaces isn't about inequality but about addressing historical disparities. \n\nHowever, does the existence of a women-only section inherently make the gym sexist towards men? That's debatable. It could be seen as a way to promote equality by offering a specific area where women can work out without pressure, which doesn't necessarily disadvantage men. The men still have access to the remaining 75% of the gym. \n\nBut the author feels that this setup is unfair because they pay the same for less. The girlfriend's response about it being different for women might stem from her perspective that these spaces are necessary and not about exclusion. \n\nIs the author wrong for not accepting this? If the gym is designed to address systemic issues that women face, then the author's refusal to switch might be based on a misunderstanding of the intent behind the women-only section. But if the author genuinely feels that the gym is being discriminatory towards men, then their stance is valid. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author's issue is more about personal preference\u2014wanting to work out with their girlfriend but having a principle against the women-only section. The girlfriend might feel that her needs and the gym's setup are more important. \n\nIn terms of social norms, creating safe spaces for marginalized groups can be a legitimate need. So, the author might be seen as not recognizing the importance of such spaces. Alternatively, if the gym was set up to be equally accessible to all, the author's concern about unequal access could be justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the gym's policy is discriminatory or a necessary accommodation. If it's the latter, then the author might be the asshole for not understanding. If it's the former, then the girlfriend might be the one not seeing the issue. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the gym isn't denying anyone access to the entire facility; it's just a portion reserved for women. The author could still use the majority of the gym. The women-only section is a choice, not a restriction on men. Therefore, the author's refusal might be based on a principle that's not widely accepted, making them the asshole for not accepting the compromise. But wait, if the policy is about equality, then the author's stance is against a policy that's meant to promote equality, which could be seen as problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if the policy is seen as reverse discrimination, the author might not be in the wrong. But given that the majority of the gym is still accessible, the author's argument about equal value for money might not hold. \n\nHmm, I'm going back and forth. But considering that the gym's policy is intended to provide a safe space for women and that the majority of the facilities are still accessible to men, the author's stance might be perceived as not understanding the importance of such sections, making them the asshole. Therefore, answer A.\n"
