Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym, which has a women-only section. The author objects because he feels it's sexist to pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment if you're a man. The girlfriend thinks he's being stubborn and doesn't understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is saying that it's unfair to pay full price but not have equal access. That sounds like a valid point about equality. If you pay the same, you should have the same access. But then there's the fact that the women-only section is meant to provide a safer or more comfortable space for women, which is a common issue in gyms. So, the gym is offering a service that caters to women's needs, which might be important for them to feel comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not being asked to exclude himself from the women-only section, just that he can't access it. So, he's still free to use the rest of the gym. The gym is allowing women to have a space that's exclusively theirs. The question is whether that's sexist. The author is drawing a parallel to if the opposite were true, but the girlfriend says it's different for women. Maybe because historically, women have been excluded from such spaces more often, so creating a safe space is a response to that. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, it's about equal access. If you pay the same, why not have the same access? However, the gym is structured with a specific section for women, not excluding men entirely. The author is not being forced to use that section, but he's paying for the full gym access. The girlfriend might see the women-only section as a necessary service, not as a restriction on men. \n\nIs the author's reasoning valid? If the gym had a section that only men could use, then women would have the same access issue. But the existence of a women-only section is often a way to ensure that women have a space where they can work out without harassment or feeling uncomfortable. So maybe the author is misunderstanding the purpose. The gym isn't denying men access to the entire gym; they just have a part that's reserved. The author is conflating the idea of gender-specific spaces with discrimination, but in some contexts, these spaces are considered beneficial for one group without necessarily being exclusionary to the other. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she sees it as a necessary part of the gym, not a sexist policy. The author is not wrong to point out the inequality in access, but perhaps he's not considering the reasons behind the women-only section. The key is whether the gym is providing equal value for the fee. If the women-only section is a part of the service that's included in the membership, then the author is paying for all services, including those that he can't access. However, the gym's business model might be that the women-only section is an added value, so men still get access to the general areas, and women have that extra. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the gym's policy is that the women-only section is part of the membership, and the author is not allowed there, then it's a case of different access based on gender. But the context of the women-only section being for safety and comfort might be a valid reason. The author's issue is with the fairness of paying the same for less access, but the gym might be structured that way to serve a specific need. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for pointing out the discrepancy in access, but he might not be fully understanding the rationale behind the women-only section. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's necessary, so the author's refusal to switch gyms is a personal choice based on his values. Whether that makes him the asshole is subjective. The answer likely depends on whether the user values equal access over the need for women-only spaces. Given that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as the author is voicing a valid concern about equality, even if the girlfriend sees it differently.\n"
