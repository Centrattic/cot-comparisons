Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The girlfriend suggested they carpool and work out together, but the author is upset because the gym has a section that only women can use. The author argues that it's sexist because they charge the same fee but restrict access based on gender. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting and says it's different for women.\n\nHmm. So, the key point here is about gender equality and whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. The author is concerned that men can't use the women-only section, which is a quarter of the gym. If they pay the same fee but can't access all the equipment, that's a problem. The girlfriend doesn't see it the same way, thinking it's different for women, perhaps due to their needs for a safe space or specific amenities.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym charges everyone the same but limits access to certain areas based on gender, that does seem like a form of discrimination. It's like charging equal prices but providing unequal access. The author's argument is that it's sexist because it's restricting men without a valid reason, while the women's section is justified as a safe space. But is the justification enough?\n\nI need to consider societal norms here. Women-only sections in gyms are often created to address safety concerns or to provide a comfortable environment where women can work out without feeling self-conscious or harassed. However, from the author's side, if the gym is charging the same for both members but limiting access, it's a double standard. But maybe the women's section is separate for a reason, and the gym isn't necessarily denying men all access\u2014it's just a part of the facility. The author is free to use the other 75% of the gym, so maybe they can still get a good workout.\n\nWait, but the author's issue is about being charged for full access when they can't use all the equipment. If the gym isn't offering the same experience to everyone, that's a problem. It's like paying for a hotel room but not being allowed to use the pool. The justification of \"it's different for women\" might not hold if the gym is supposed to provide equal value for the membership fee.\n\nBut then again, maybe the women's section is optional. If the gym allows women to have a space that's exclusive, but men can use the rest, the author is still getting access to most of the facilities. The author's problem is with the principle of being denied a portion of the gym's equipment based on gender. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the women-only section, perhaps for safety or comfort.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? It depends on the gym's policies. If the gym is legally allowed to have such sections and the author can still use the majority of the gym, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the gym is charging equal fees but providing unequal access, that's a fairness issue. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in how the gym treats members based on gender. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" could be dismissing the author's valid concern about equality.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author is trying to explain their perspective, but the girlfriend is not understanding or accepting it. The author might not be the asshole here because they're standing up for their beliefs about fairness. However, if the author is making a big deal out of something that the girlfriend sees as necessary for her own comfort or safety, then maybe the author isn't considering her perspective. It's a balance between personal principles and respecting each other's needs.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're raising a valid point about equality, but it's also a complex situation where both sides might have valid concerns. The key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by having a women-only section, then maybe the author is being a bit rigid. However, the author's argument about equal access for the same price is also valid. It's tricky, but leaning towards B because the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to support a policy they find discriminatory.\n"
