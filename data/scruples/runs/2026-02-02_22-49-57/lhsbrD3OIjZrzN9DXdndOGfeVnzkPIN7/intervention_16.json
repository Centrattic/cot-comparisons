Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author and their girlfriend both like working out and have been going to different gyms. The girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym for convenience, like carpooling and working out together. But the author objects because the gym has a \"women only\" section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author argues it's sexist since they'd pay the same but use less space and equipment. The girlfriend called them stupid and said it's different for women, which made the author question if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of \"women only\" gyms. They exist to provide a safe space for women, often to address issues like feeling uncomfortable in co-ed environments, which can be a real concern. The justification here is that it's meant to be inclusive and safe, not necessarily to exclude men but to create a supportive atmosphere for women.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that paying the same fee for 75% access is unfair. But the key point is that the gym isn't charging them differently. The fee covers the entire gym, including the women-only section. So by joining the same gym, the author would have access to all areas except the women-only one. The fact that 25% is reserved for women doesn't mean the author is excluded from the entire gym; they still get access to 75%, which is more than the separate section. \n\nHowever, the author might feel that the policy is discriminatory because it's a one-way restriction. But from the girlfriend's perspective, the women-only section isn't meant to prevent men from using their part of the gym, but rather to ensure women have a space where they feel comfortable and free from harassment. The author might not be considering the intent behind the section, which is about safety and inclusivity rather than a direct exclusion of men from paying the same rate for less space. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's argument didn't account for her perspective. She might be defensive because she values the women-only section for her own reasons. The author could be seen as not respecting her valid concerns, even if the policy itself is controversial. \n\nThe author is in a position where they want to support their partner but have a moral issue with the gym's policy. It's a conflict between personal values and relationship compromise. The core question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. \n\nI think the author has a legitimate concern about perceived unfairness, but the girlfriend's perspective is equally valid in terms of her need for a safe space. The real issue here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing their discomfort, but they could also be missing the broader context of why such sections exist. The answer likely leans towards AITA resolution where the author isn't the asshole but needs to understand the other viewpoint. So the answer is B.\n"
