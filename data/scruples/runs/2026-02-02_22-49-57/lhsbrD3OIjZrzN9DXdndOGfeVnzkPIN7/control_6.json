Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym, but the guy objects because the gym has a women-only section that he finds sexist. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but women can use a quarter of the area and equipment, while the guy can't access that section. The author argues that it's unfair to pay the same price but have limited access based on gender. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women and gets upset when he compares it to her hypothetical situation.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about gender equality in gym policies. The author is objecting to a policy that he perceives as discriminatory. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to go to a gym that he feels is sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender equality. If a facility charges the same fee but restricts access to certain areas or equipment based on gender, that's a form of discrimination. The author is pointing out that if he pays the same as women, he should have the same access. The women-only section is a separate area, but if the gym is charging men the same but not allowing them to use part of the premises, that's unequal treatment. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the women-only section exists for reasons like safety or comfort, which is a common justification. But the problem here is that the gym isn't providing equivalent access in exchange for the same cost. If the gym were to charge women less because they can only use a quarter of the space, that would be fair. But since they charge the same, it's a discrepancy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not see the issue because she benefits from the women-only section, perhaps seeing it as a positive space for women. But the author's concern is about the inequity in access. If the gym had a policy where each gender paid for the portion they could access, that would be fairer. But since the pricing is the same, the author is highlighting a potential sexism in the gym's policy.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author is trying to communicate his discomfort with the policy. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might indicate a lack of understanding of the principle of equal treatment. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency; he's advocating for equal access. The real issue is the gym's policy, not the author's stance. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's objecting to a discriminatory practice.\n"
