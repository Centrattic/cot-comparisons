Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is that the author doesn't want to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. His argument is that if he pays the same fee, he should have access to all the equipment, and being excluded from a quarter of the gym based on his gender is sexist. His girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women, so the author is questioning if he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the gym charges everyone the same price but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is essentially saying that if he were a woman, he wouldn't accept being barred from part of the gym. It's a matter of equality\u2014why should women have a section that men can't access when men can use the entire gym?\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might be defending the women-only section as a space where women feel more comfortable or safe. Many gyms have such sections because some women prefer an environment without men, maybe to avoid feeling self-conscious or to have a space where they can focus without being watched. So the girlfriend's perspective could be about inclusivity and respect for women's choices, not just about inequality. \n\nBut wait, the author's argument is that the fee is the same, so access should be equal. If the gym's policy is to have a women-only area, but men pay the same as women yet can't use all the equipment, that's a form of gender-based discrimination. It's like charging the same price but providing less access to certain genders. That seems unfair. However, the counterpoint is that the women-only section is optional for women. Women can choose to use the entire gym if they want, but men can't access the women-only part. But if the gym is charging the same entrance fee regardless, then men are effectively paying for a service they can't use. That's the crux of the author's argument.\n\nThe key here is to assess whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym offers a women-only section but charges men the same as women, then men aren't being charged extra for not using that section. However, the author is paying to use the entire gym but is restricted. So from a fairness standpoint, if women can choose to use the entire gym, but men can't access parts of it, that's unequal treatment. The gym might have the women-only section for good reasons, but the policy of charging the same fee for unequal access is problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from a misunderstanding. She might not see the issue as one of access but rather as a women's empowerment thing. She might think the women-only section is necessary and not a problem in terms of equality. The author is pointing out a logical inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the gym's policy is that women can access more space for the same price, that's a form of gender-based pricing or access, which is discriminatory. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the author is standing up for equal treatment and pointing out a discriminatory policy, then he's not in the wrong. The gym's policy is the problem. However, the author's approach might be seen as not understanding his girlfriend's perspective. If he's dismissing her reasons for needing the women-only section without acknowledging her feelings, that could be an issue. But the core of the argument is about the gym's policy, which is the main point here. \n\nIn summary, the author's stance is about equality in access and pricing, which is valid. The girlfriend's position is about the necessity of the women-only section, which is also valid. The problem lies with the gym's policy, not the author for pointing it out. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
