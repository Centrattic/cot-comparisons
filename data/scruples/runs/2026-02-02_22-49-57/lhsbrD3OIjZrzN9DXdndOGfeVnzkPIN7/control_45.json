Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend both work out and have been going to different gyms. The girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym so they can carpool and workout together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for everyone, but the women's section takes up a quarter of the gym and has a quarter of the equipment. The author is upset because they feel it's unfair to pay the same fee but only be allowed to use 75% of the gym if you're a man. The girlfriend gets upset and says \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's point. If you pay the same fee but have restricted access based on gender, isn't that discriminatory? The author is comparing it to if the gym charged women the same but restricted men's access. That seems like a fair comparison. If the gym had a men-only section and women paid full price but couldn't use part of the gym, that would likely be seen as sexist. So the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that the women-only section is intended to create a safe space for women to work out without feeling uncomfortable. Many gyms offer such sections to address issues like harassment or to make women feel more at ease. So, from the girlfriend's side, it's about providing a safe environment, not about restricting men. The author might not see the value in that or might not understand the need for such a space.\n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is actually discriminatory. If the gym is charging the same price but providing the same total value (since the women-only section is part of the overall facilities and the men can use the rest), maybe the author's issue is more about the unequal access rather than the existence of the women-only section. But if the women-only section is a separate area that's exclusively for them, then men aren't being denied access to that part, just the opposite. So the author is being charged for access to the entire gym, but can't use a part of it, which would be similar to if a woman couldn't use a part of the gym. That could be a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the policy as necessary for safety and comfort, which is a legitimate concern. The author's refusal to switch gyms could be seen as not respecting the importance of that section for women. However, the author is also standing up against what they perceive as unfair treatment based on gender.\n\nI need to consider the concept of sex-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like changing rooms or restrooms, they are allowed under certain circumstances. For gyms, providing a women-only area can be a way to address issues of harassment or to create a more comfortable environment. However, if the gym is charging the same price but not allowing men to use the entire facility, that could be a problem. But if the women-only area is part of the gym's service, and men are still allowed to use the rest, it's not exactly the same as charging for full access and then restricting it. The author is paying for the entire gym, but the existence of a women-only section doesn't mean the gym is denying them access to the rest. The author can still use the other 75% of the equipment and space. The only difference is that women have an exclusive area, which is a common practice in many gyms.\n\nSo, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they are pointing out a potential inconsistency. However, the girlfriend is standing up for a policy that many women find important. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable. The author is essentially saying that if the gym is offering a section that's only for women, then men shouldn't have to pay for that part. But the gym may structure their pricing to include all areas regardless of individual usage. Therefore, the author is being reasonable in not wanting to pay for access to a part they can't use, but the girlfriend is also justified in supporting the women-only section for safety and comfort.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is not wrong for noticing the discrepancy, but the girlfriend isn't wrong either for valuing the women-only section. The situation is more about differing values and understanding. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's also about mutual respect and compromise. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're highlighting a potential issue of unequal access, even if the intention is different.\n"
