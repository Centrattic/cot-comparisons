Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. The main issue is the gym's policy where men would pay the same fee but can't use a quarter of the equipment and space. The girlfriend suggested switching for carpooling and working out together, but the AITA objects on grounds of perceived sexism.\n\nFirst, the AITA's argument is that it's unfair for men to pay the same but have less access. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. The key here is whether the policy is actually discriminatory. The gym offers a section that's women-only, which might be intended to create a space where women feel safer or more comfortable. However, if men are being excluded from that area without a proportional adjustment in price, that could be seen as a problem. \n\nBut wait, the gym charges the same fee for both genders. If the women's section is part of the total facility, then maybe the pricing is based on the entire gym, not the sections. So if men can use the other 75% and women can use the entire gym, maybe the pricing is fair. However, the AITA is being excluded from a part of the gym they pay for. The question is whether the gym's policy is legitimate. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if a man pays the same as a woman but can't use a portion of the facility, that's a problem. The justification that \"it's different for women\" might not hold up if the policy leads to unequal access without a legitimate reason. However, some places have women-only areas for safety or comfort, which can be a valid reason. But if the pricing is the same, does that mean men are effectively subsidizing a women-only space? \n\nThe AITA's argument is about equal access for equal price. The girlfriend's stance is that the policy is for women's benefit, which the AITA doesn't understand. The core issue is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowing women to use their own section while men can't, but the fee is the same, then technically, men are not getting the full value. However, if the women's section is a service provided to women as part of their membership, then maybe it's okay. \n\nBut the problem arises if the gym is charging men the same rate without offering the same services. It's a question of whether the policy is fair. The AITA isn't being sexist by pointing out the inequity in access. The girlfriend's dismissal of the AITA's argument as being \"stupid\" and the use of \"it's different for women\" suggests that she's not addressing the actual concern of unequal access. \n\nIn this case, the AITA is pointing out a potential inconsistency or unfairness in the gym's policy. The girlfriend's response is defensive, which might indicate that the AITA isn't the asshole here. The AITA is questioning a policy that seems to create an unequal experience for men, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
