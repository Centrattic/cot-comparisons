Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend has a gym with a women-only section. The author doesn't want to join her gym because they think it's sexist that men are charged the same but can't use that section, which is a quarter of the gym. The girlfriend gets upset when he compares it to her being charged the same but forbidden from using part of the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is right or wrong. The key points here are about gender segregation in gyms and whether it's discriminatory. The author is objecting to the gym's policy on the grounds that it's unfair because men can't access the women-only area, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, implying that women's reasons for having separate spaces are valid, perhaps for safety or comfort.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is drawing a parallel between his situation and what the girlfriend would face if she were in his position. That's a classic fairness argument. However, the existence of women-only spaces in gyms is often justified as providing a safer environment for women, which can be important for many. But the author's issue is that he's being excluded from part of the facility without a similar justification from his side. \n\nIs the author being sexist by not recognizing the difference in the need for women-only spaces? Or is he right to see this as a double standard? If the gym allows women to have exclusive access to a portion of the facility, but doesn't do the same for men, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, the justification for women-only spaces is often rooted in addressing historical gender imbalances and creating safe spaces. But if the author is arguing that the gym's policy is unfair because it's a one-way exclusion, that's a valid point. \n\nBut maybe the author is missing the context. Women-only gyms or sections can be about safety and comfort, which is a recognized need. The author is equating his exclusion to what he thinks the girlfriend would feel if the situation were reversed, but that might not account for the different reasons behind the segregation. The girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is necessary for her to feel safe, which is a different dynamic than a man being excluded without a similar reason. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym's policy is based on legitimate needs for women, then the author's objection might be seen as not understanding that context. However, if the gym is providing a service where part of it is exclusive to women, but not to men, then it's a double standard. The question is whether that's inherently sexist. \n\nIn some cases, single-gender spaces are allowed under anti-discrimination laws because they serve a specific purpose. For example, women-only gyms can be considered as addressing historical discrimination. So the gym isn't necessarily violating any policies by having a women-only section. Therefore, the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding of the intent behind such spaces. \n\nOn the other hand, if the gym allows women to have exclusive areas but doesn't allow men the same, that could be seen as discriminatory. But usually, such spaces are exceptions made for specific reasons. The author is arguing that it's unfair because he's being charged the same but has less access. However, if the women-only section is for a legitimate reason, the gym might not be obligated to provide the same for men. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because he's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. But the girlfriend's perspective is that the women-only section serves a purpose that isn't the same for men. The answer hinges on whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowed to have a women-only section for valid reasons, then the author's objection might not hold, making him the asshole. If the policy is indeed a double standard without justification, then the author is right. \n\nI think the key here is understanding that women-only spaces are often justified for safety and comfort, which is a different context than the author's situation. The author is drawing an equivalence that might not consider those justifications, leading the girlfriend to feel he doesn't understand. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the different reasons behind the gym's policy. However, if the gym is creating an unequal access scenario, that's a problem. But since the gym is allowing women to have a space for their benefit, it's more about addressing existing disparities rather than creating a new one. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering the specific reasons for the women-only section and is making a false equivalence. The girlfriend's argument that it's different for women is valid in this context, so the author isn't understanding the nuance.\n"
