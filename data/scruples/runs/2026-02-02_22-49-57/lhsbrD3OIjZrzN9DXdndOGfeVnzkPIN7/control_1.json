Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to the same gym as their girlfriend because of the women-only section. The key points here are about fairness and perceptions of sexism.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts a quarter of the equipment to women only. The author argues that this is sexist because if men had to pay full price but access less equipment, it would be unfair. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks it's different for women, which implies she finds the setup acceptable.\n\nSo, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency. If the gym allows a separate area for one gender, why not the other? It's like saying women get a special section, but men don't. That could be seen as unequal treatment if the justification isn't clear. The author's comparison about women being charged the same but restricted is a valid point. It's about parity in treatment.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or societal context here that the author isn't considering. Sometimes, women-only spaces are created for reasons like safety or comfort, which isn't necessarily about inequality but about addressing specific needs. The girlfriend might see the section as beneficial, not discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is based on the idea that equal treatment means both genders should have the same access. If the gym provides a women-only section, it's a choice, but the author is right to question why men can't have the same option. It's about fairness in access relative to what's paid for. If the gym allows one gender to have exclusive access to part of the facility, it's inconsistent to not offer the same to the other gender unless there's a valid, non-discriminatory reason.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not see the issue, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is highlighting a potential double standard. Charging everyone the same while restricting part of the facility to one gender without a reciprocal arrangement for the other could be seen as sexist. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing this out. The issue here is about equity and whether the gym's policy is fair and consistent for all members.\n"
