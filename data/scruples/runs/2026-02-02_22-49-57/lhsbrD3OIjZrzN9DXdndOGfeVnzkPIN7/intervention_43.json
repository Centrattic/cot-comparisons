Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The key points are that the gym charges the same entrance fee for both genders but restricts a quarter of the equipment and area to women only. The author is upset because if they switch, they would be paying full price but not using all the equipment. The girlfriend thinks the author is being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is concerned about being charged equally but not having access to the same resources. That's a fairness issue. The gym separates a portion as women-only, which is common in some places to provide a space where women feel comfortable, especially in areas where there might be a lack of such spaces. But from a cost perspective, if men can't use that section, then effectively, they're paying for something they can't access. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. Maybe she sees the women-only section as a positive, a place where she can work out without male judgment or harassment. That's a valid point because many women prefer such spaces for safety or comfort. However, the author is pointing out that from a practical standpoint, if the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, that's a form of unequal treatment. \n\nIs it sexist? The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for finding the gym's policy sexist. On one hand, the gym's policy is intended to be inclusive and empowering for women, which is a good intention. On the other, the policy might be seen as discriminatory against men if they're charged the same but can't use the full facility. But maybe the gym is not actually doing that. If the entrance is the same price but the women have a dedicated area, perhaps the gym is not charging men for that specific section. Wait, the user says the gym charges the same entrance fee but the women-only section is part of the gym. So if you pay the entrance fee, you can access the entire gym, but only women can use that specific section. Therefore, the author would still have access to the other 75% of the gym, but the women-only area is off-limits. \n\nSo the author's argument is that they're paying full price for a gym but not getting full access. That's a valid argument in terms of value for money. However, the girlfriend might not see it that way because the existence of the women's section is a benefit for her, not a drawback. She might not want her boyfriend to be restricted from that area. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for having this concern. It's about fairness and personal comfort. If the gym allows women-only sections but still charges men the same without restricting them from the rest, maybe the author's issue is with the policy rather than the gym itself. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the author's perspective or thinking the author is overcomplicating it. \n\nSo the author is not the asshole here. They have a legitimate concern about inequity in access for the same price. The girlfriend's response of \"it's different for women\" might be dismissing the author's valid point without understanding that the policy could be seen as problematic from a fairness angle. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
