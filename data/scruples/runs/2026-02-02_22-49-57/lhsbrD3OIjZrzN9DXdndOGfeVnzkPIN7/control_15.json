Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts access to 25% of the equipment and area based on gender. They compare it to if their girlfriend would be upset if they were excluded from part of the gym. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting and says it's different for women.\n\nI need to consider the concept of equal access. If a gym charges the same but limits equipment use based on gender, that seems discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. The \"women only\" section might be for safety or comfort, but the key is that the author isn't being excluded entirely, just part of the space. However, the author is being charged full price without access to all facilities, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's \"different for women\" might relate to reasons like women-only spaces for safety or to feel comfortable. But from the author's perspective, paying the same for less access is a valid concern. It's a matter of fairness. The author isn't rejecting the women-only section, but the unequal access for the same price. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being sexist by pointing out the unequal treatment. The gym's policy might be legal or intended for good reasons, but the author is justified in feeling it's unfair. The girlfriend's reaction to calling the author \"stupid\" and getting upset might be the real issue here. The author isn't wrong for having this concern; it's about equality in service for the price paid. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
