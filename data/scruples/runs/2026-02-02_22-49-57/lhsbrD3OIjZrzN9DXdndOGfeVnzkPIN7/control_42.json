Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend suggesting they both go to the same gym, but the guy is against it because the gym has a \"women only\" section. He argues that it's sexist because he'd pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment. She gets upset and says it's different for women.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the \"women only\" section and the perceived sexism. The guy is uncomfortable with the idea that the gym offers a section exclusively for women while charging the same entrance fee. From his perspective, it's like paying full price for less access. But the girlfriend thinks it's different for women, maybe because she sees the women-only section as a positive, safe space for her gender. \n\nI need to consider gender dynamics and societal norms. In many cases, women-only spaces in gyms are created to address historical disparities and provide environments where women feel more comfortable, especially in male-dominated areas. So, the gym's policy might be intentional to support women's inclusivity and safety. However, the guy's argument is about equal access for the same price, which could be seen as a fair point.\n\nBut wait, the problem is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym is designed that way for a valid reason (like accommodating women's needs or safety), then the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding. On the other hand, if the gym's policy is discriminatory, then maybe he's right to question it. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she views the women-only section as necessary or beneficial. The author's comparison\u2014would she go to a gym that charged men the same but restricted them\u2014might not be equivalent because the context of why such sections exist for women is different. Women often face harassment or discomfort in co-ed gyms, so having a dedicated space can be empowering. \n\nSo, the author is not wrong in pointing out the inconsistency in access, but the underlying reason for the women-only section is to address systemic issues. Therefore, his objection could be seen as missing the point. Maybe he should focus on the intent rather than the literal access. But does that make him the asshole? It depends on whether his stance is valid. \n\nAlternatively, the gym could be structured to allow both to use all areas, but the existence of a women-only section might not be a problem if it's optional. However, since the entrance fee is the same and men can't access that section, the author is right to question if it's a fair exchange. But the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a benefit, not a restriction. \n\nWait, but the women-only section is part of the gym, so if the guy is going there, he can use the rest of the gym. The problem is that he's not okay with some areas being restricted. It's about personal boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with that setup, he's not wrong for not wanting to go there. The girlfriend's pushback might stem from not seeing the issue the same way. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concern is about equal access and potentially discriminatory practices. However, if the women-only section is meant to support women, then maybe the author's perspective is too rigid. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the core issue is the author's perspective on the gym's policy. If the gym is charging the same fee and not allowing men to use a portion of the facilities, that could be seen as a disparity. However, the existence of a women-only section is often justified for safety and inclusivity. The author's objection is valid if he feels it's unequal, but the girlfriend's insistence might be about her own comfort. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having this concern. He's not being sexist for pointing out the inconsistency, but the girlfriend's viewpoint is also rooted in addressing real issues. So, answer B.\n"
