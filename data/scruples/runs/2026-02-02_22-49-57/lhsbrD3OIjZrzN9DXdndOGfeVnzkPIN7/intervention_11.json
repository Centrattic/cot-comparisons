Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The author of the question is reluctant because the gym has a \"women only\" section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author argues that it's sexist because men pay the same fee but can't use that section, while women can. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is objecting to a policy that limits access based on gender. The gym charges the same fee but restricts certain areas to women. From the author's perspective, that's unequal treatment. The girlfriend, however, seems to accept the policy as being different for women, which the author finds confusing.\n\nI should consider the concept of single-sex spaces. Some argue that women-only areas in gyms can be important for creating a safe environment where women might feel more comfortable, especially in a male-dominated space. However, the author's issue is that men are being excluded from a portion of the facility without a proportional adjustment in cost. If the gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access, that could be seen as discriminatory against men, unless there's a compensatory benefit for women that men aren't receiving.\n\nThe author's analogy is asking if the girlfriend would accept the reverse situation, which she doesn't, indicating that she sees the policies as different. The problem here is the asymmetry in treatment. If the gym is providing a women-only section as a benefit, then men aren't being discriminated against; they just don't get access to that specific benefit. However, the author feels that since they're paying the same, they should have equal access.\n\nBut wait, the gym might be offering a special feature for women, which women can take advantage of, while men can still use the rest. If the cost is the same, maybe it's not inherently sexist, but the author's perspective is that it's unequal. The key is whether the policy is justifiable. If the women's section is intended to provide a safe space, that's a different justification than merely segregating without purpose. However, if the gym is charging men the same fee but not allowing them to use that section, which is part of the facility they're paying for, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of equal access. If the gym is a shared space, but certain sections are restricted based on sex, then unless there's a valid reason (like safety), it might be seen as discriminatory. However, in some contexts, single-sex spaces are allowed under anti-discrimination laws for specific reasons, like safety in prisons or locker rooms. But a gym is a different scenario. The question is whether the gym's policy is justified here.\n\nThe author's frustration is that they're being asked to accept a policy they find discriminatory. The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see it that way, which could be a communication issue or a difference in values. The author is standing up for their belief in equal access, which is a valid stance. However, the girlfriend's perspective might be that the gym's policy is addressing women's needs, which the author isn't recognizing.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the justification for the women-only section. If the gym's policy is to provide a safe, female-only space without additional cost to men, then it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for objecting to what they see as unequal treatment, but the girlfriend might not be wrong either, given the intent behind the women-only section. However, from a standpoint of equal access and non-discrimination, the author's position is more aligned with principles of fairness. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
