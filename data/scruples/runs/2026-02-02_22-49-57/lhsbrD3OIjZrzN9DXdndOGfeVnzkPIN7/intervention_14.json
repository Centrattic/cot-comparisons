Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing to go to the same gym as their girlfriend because it has a women-only section. The key points are about fairness and sexism.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for both genders but has a section exclusively for women. The author argues that if they had to pay the same but couldn't use part of the facility, it's unfair. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women. \n\nI need to consider whether the author is correct in seeing this as sexist. The women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is a valid reason. However, from the author's perspective, if he's paying for full access but is excluded from a portion, that's discriminatory as well. It's a matter of equity if both genders are being restricted in some way. \n\nThe author's analogy is comparing the situation: if the roles were reversed, would the girlfriend accept being charged the same but restricted? The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see the issue from his side. \n\nSo, the author is pointing out an inconsistency in how the gym's policy treats both genders. If the policy is meant to be inclusive for women, but effectively excludes men from part of the facility, it could be seen as a form of discrimination. The author isn't against women having a safe space, but against being charged equally while having limited access. \n\nIt's a complex issue. The author might be misunderstanding the intent behind the women-only section, but their reasoning about fairness in access and cost is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for raising this point. The answer would be B.\n"
