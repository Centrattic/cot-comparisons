Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to switch gyms because of the women-only section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend go to different gyms. The girlfriend wants to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is her gym has a women-only section. The author is upset because he feels it's sexist\u2014charging the same fee but limiting access to 25% of the equipment based on gender. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting and that it's different for women.\n\nNow, the key points here are about gender equality and whether the author's reasoning is valid. The author is comparing the situation to if a gym charged women the same but restricted their access. The girlfriend responds that it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women-only section as a positive or necessary accommodation.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both are charged the same but have different access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of intent. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in treatment. However, the women-only section might be intended to provide a safe or comfortable space for women, which some people support as addressing a different kind of issue (like harassment or making women feel more welcome in gyms).\n\nBut the author's argument is that if the pricing is the same but access is different, it's unfair. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might see the women-only section as a positive, perhaps a way to support women, but that doesn't negate the author's valid point about equal access for all members once they've paid the same fee. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym is providing the same service (access to equipment) for the same price but restricting part of it based on gender, that's a problem. The author is highlighting a potential sexism in the policy. Unless there's a legal or policy reason (like separate hours for safety, which is different from equipment access), the author's stance might be justified. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective might be that the women's section is a positive aspect, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to point out the apparent inequality. So, the answer would depend on whether the gym's policy is considered discriminatory. If it is, then the author isn't wrong to point it out. If not, maybe he's misinterpreting the intent. But from a fairness standpoint, the author's argument seems valid.\n"
