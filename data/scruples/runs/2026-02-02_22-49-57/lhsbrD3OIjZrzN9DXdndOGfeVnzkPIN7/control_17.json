Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend who both work out. The girlfriend wants him to switch to her gym for convenience, but he's against it because of the \"women only\" section.\n\nSo, the guy's reasoning is that the gym charges the same fee for both men and women, but the women's section restricts men from using 25% of the equipment and space. He thinks this is sexist because if a man paid the same but couldn't use part of the facility, it'd be unfair. The girlfriend is upset and says it's \"different for women,\" which he's struggling to understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like locker rooms or certain sports, separating by gender is common for privacy or safety. But in a gym, creating a women-only area might be to encourage female participation in areas where they might feel uncomfortable. However, the key point here is the equal fee but unequal access.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if men can't access part of the gym they're paying for, that's a problem. But the gym's policy might be intended to provide a safe space for women. The guy's argument is about equal access for the price paid. The girlfriend's perspective is that the women's section serves a purpose, perhaps to support women in a male-dominated environment.\n\nIs the guy wrong for not wanting to pay for something he can't use? If the gym allows that, maybe it's their business model. But from the guy's point of view, he's being charged the same to use less. However, the women who use the women-only section aren't restricted from the rest, perhaps. Wait, the description says the women's section is part of the gym, but men can't use it. So, women have access to the entire gym, while men can't use that 25% section. So women are allowed to use everything, but men can't use part of it. That's a difference in access.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-segregated spaces can be allowed under certain conditions, like for religious or cultural reasons, or if it's a private establishment. However, if they're charging the same but offering different access, that might be a fairness issue. But the gym might argue that the women's section is a benefit for women, not a restriction for men. So men pay the same but don't get the women's section as part of their access. Wait, no\u2014if the women's section is part of the gym, then maybe men are allowed in the rest, but women can also go to the rest. Wait, the description says the woman's section is 1/4 of the area and 1/4 of the equipment. So the remaining 75% is co-ed? Or is the women's section separate, meaning women can use all the equipment, including the women-only part, and men can't use the women-only part but can use the rest. If that's the case, then men are paying for access to 75% of the gym, while women pay the same but get access to 100% (including the women-only part). So the guy is arguing that he's being charged the same but not getting the same access. That seems like a valid point.\n\nBut the girlfriend might think that the women's section is necessary for women's comfort and safety. So the guy's argument is about equity in access, while the girlfriend's is about inclusivity and support for women. The question is whether the guy is wrong for not wanting to accept this arrangement.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, if a man pays the same fee but is restricted from using part of the facility, that's inequitable. The gym's policy creates a situation where men and women aren't getting equal value for their payment. The women can use all the equipment (assuming the women-only section is part of the total), while men can't. So the guy is correct in pointing out the discrepancy. The girlfriend might not see it as a problem because she benefits from the women-only section, but the guy is justified in his stance.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's different for women, which might relate to societal issues where women need safe spaces in gyms. The guy might not be considering the reasons behind the women-only section. But his argument is about equal access for equal payment.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the gym is allowed to have such a policy, but it's leading to unequal access for men, then the guy's position is understandable. But if the policy is intended to support women and not meant to disadvantage men, then maybe the guy is being overly literal. However, from a fairness perspective, charging the same for different access is an issue.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his reasoning is about equity in access for payment. The gym's policy creates an unfair situation where men pay the same but get less access, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the problem from his perspective, but the guy's stance is reasonable.\n"
