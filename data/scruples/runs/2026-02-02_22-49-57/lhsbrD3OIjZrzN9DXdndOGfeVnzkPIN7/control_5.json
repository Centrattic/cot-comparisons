Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the guy to switch gyms so they can work out together. The key issue is the \"women only\" section in her gym. The author doesn't want to go there because he feels it's sexist that they'd pay the same fee but only have access to part of the facilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the gym's setup. The gym charges the same entrance fee for everyone, but women have an exclusive area. The author argues that this is unequal because men can't use that section, so they're effectively paying for less. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, maybe due to safety or comfort reasons. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not wanting to go there? Well, from his perspective, he's pointing out a disparity in access. If both genders pay the same but one group can't use certain parts, that's a form of discrimination. On the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that the women-only section exists to provide a safe space for women, which is a common argument for such spaces. \n\nBut the author is drawing a parallel: if women were excluded from part of the gym, he wouldn't accept it. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the situation isn't the same. Maybe she sees the women's section as empowering or necessary, and his analogy is invalid because the contexts differ. \n\nLegally, in the US, Title IX and other laws require equal access, but gyms can have gendered sections if they're voluntary. So, the gym isn't necessarily violating any laws. However, the author's concern about unequal treatment is valid on a principle level. If he's being asked to accept unequal access for himself, that's a reasonable stance. \n\nThe girlfriend might be in the right in her belief that women-only spaces are justified, but the author isn't wrong to feel that the gym's policy is discriminatory. The conflict arises from differing views on gender equality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having that perspective. \n\nI think the author isn't the asshole. He's standing up for equality, even if it causes tension. The girlfriend might not see the parallel, but his reasoning is logical. So the answer is B.\n"
