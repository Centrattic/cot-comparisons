Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is the author feels it's sexist that the gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author sees it as unfair because he can't use part of the gym, which he paid for equally. From his point of view, it's about equal access for the price. On the other hand, his girlfriend might believe that the women-only section is important for women's comfort and safety, which might explain why she's not seeing the issue the same way.\n\nNow, the concept of single-sex spaces in gyms is a known thing. Many women prefer or require spaces where they can work out without male presence, especially for reasons like feeling uncomfortable, unsafe, or to avoid being objectified. So, the existence of a women-only section isn't necessarily about excluding men, but about providing a safe environment for women. \n\nThe author's argument is based on the idea of equal access to facilities when paying the same fee. But if the gym offers a section that's exclusively for women, is that inherently sexist? It depends on the context. If the gym is otherwise fully accessible to men and the women-only area is an additional option, then maybe it's not discriminatory. However, if the gym were structured so that men had similar restrictions, that would be a different scenario. \n\nThe author's girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might stem from the understanding that women have different needs or experiences in such spaces. The author's comparison to women being forbidden from using equipment might not fully capture the nuances. The women-only section is a choice, not a restriction on women. Men aren't being denied access to the entire gym; they just can't use that specific part. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym is charging the same fee and offering the same services except for that one section, maybe the author has a valid point about not getting full value. But if the women-only section is an added benefit for women, not a subtraction for men, then the author's stance might not be the issue. It's about whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the policy is to provide a safe space without denying men access to the rest, then the author's objection could be seen as not understanding the purpose of the women-only section. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is pointing out a discrepancy in access based on gender. However, the presence of a women-only area might be a legitimate service offered by the gym, and the author could choose to accept that or not. If the author values equality in access and feels he's being treated unequally, that's a valid perspective. But the girlfriend might see it as a necessary feature for women's comfort. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym offers the same amenities to men in the rest of the facility and the women-only section is an additional option, then the author's objection might not hold. Alternatively, if the gym is structuring fees in a way that men pay full price for less access, that could be a problem. But the description says the women-only section is a part of the gym, not the other way around. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance is about equality of access, which is a valid concern. However, the existence of a women-only section might be justified for reasons of gender inclusivity and safety. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a cultural and social aspect to consider. The girlfriend's frustration might come from not understanding that the author sees the policy as discriminatory, but if the policy is designed to support women's needs, then the author's perspective is valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because his objection is about equal access for the same price, which is a reasonable point. The gym's policy might have good intentions, but the author's right to feel that way is valid.\n"
