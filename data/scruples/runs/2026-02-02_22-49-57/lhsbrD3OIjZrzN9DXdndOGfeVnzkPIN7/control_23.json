Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is that the gym charges everyone the same fee, but women have access to a separate section where men can't go. The author argues that this is unfair because men can't use that part, so effectively paying for less access. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women and doesn't see the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of \"women-only\" spaces in gyms. These sections are often intended to provide a comfortable environment for women, who might feel self-conscious or unsafe in a mixed setting. So, the gym is offering a choice, not forcing anyone to use the women-only area. Men can use the rest of the facility, so technically, they're not excluded from anything else if they don't want to go into the women's section. The author is upset because he feels it's discriminatory since men pay the same but can't use that part. However, the women-only section exists for a reason, and the gym isn't taking away access from men; they're just giving women an option. \n\nThe author's analogy is asking if his girlfriend would accept being charged the same but forbidden from using a large part of the gym if the roles were reversed. His girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might stem from understanding the necessity of such spaces for women's comfort and safety. The author is not being denied access to the gym's main areas; he's just not allowed into the women's section, which is designed for women's use. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the gym allows both genders to use most of the facilities except the women-only section, which is a choice for women. The author is not being excluded from the majority of the gym, just the specific section. The argument about equality might be valid in a different context, but in this case, the gym is providing an option for women without taking away from the men's access. The girlfriend's perspective is that the women-only section serves a purpose, and the author isn't being treated unfairly because he can still use the rest of the gym. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's pointing out a disparity, but the gym's policy isn't forcing exclusion; it's providing a choice. The girlfriend's frustration might come from not seeing the necessity of the women-only section, but the author's stance is about equality in access. However, considering the intent and context of women-only spaces, the author might not be the asshole here because he's not being excluded from the main facilities and is raising a valid point about access disparities. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
