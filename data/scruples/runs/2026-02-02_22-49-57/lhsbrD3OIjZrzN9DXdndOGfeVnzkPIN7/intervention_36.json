Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The issue is that the girlfriend's gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author objects because they think it's sexist, arguing that paying the same fee but having access to less equipment is unfair. The girlfriend dismisses the author's concern, saying that it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the core of the argument. The author's main point is about equal access in exchange for the same price. If the gym charges everyone the same but reserves a portion of the facilities for one gender, does that create an unequal benefit? The author is drawing a parallel between their situation and what the girlfriend would face if the roles were reversed.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the gym offers the same membership fee regardless of which section you use, but one section is restricted by gender, there's a potential inconsistency. The author is pointing out that if the \"women only\" section is part of the gym, then men are being charged for access to a part they can't use, which seems unfair. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" suggests she sees the gendered section as justified, possibly for reasons like safety, preference, or addressing past inequities in gym spaces.\n\nBut is the author wrong to find this arrangement sexist? The key is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The argument hinges on the principle that equal price should correspond to equal access. If the gym allows a subset of members to use more facilities based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory in terms of value received. However, some might argue that the \"women only\" section is a separate amenity that all members pay for, but only women can use, which could be a form of investment in female inclusivity, even if it's not equally accessible to all.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the \"women only\" section. If it's meant to create a safe space for women, which is a common reason for such sections, then the author's objection might be seen as not considering the purpose. However, the author isn't opposing the existence of the section but the financial aspect\u2014paying full price for lesser access. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from a different perspective on what constitutes fairness, perhaps valuing the benefits the women-only section provides for her gender.\n\nThe author's question is whether they are the asshole for not wanting to support a gym with this policy. The user opines that the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to evaluate if that's correct. The author's argument is logical and based on equal treatment for equal price. The girlfriend's response, that it's different for women, might be based on her own experiences or beliefs about gender dynamics in gyms, which are complex and sometimes justified.\n\nHowever, the author is not denying women the right to the section; they're objecting to the unequal access for men who pay the same. This could be a point of contention in their relationship, not just a moral issue. The question isn't just about the gym policy but about the author's right to feel that it's unfair. If the author's perspective is valid, then they're not in the wrong. If the policy is seen as a legitimate effort to address historical imbalances in fitness spaces, then the author's objection might be less about the policy itself and more about the perceived unfairness in access.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument is about fairness in pricing and access. If the gym truly offers the same value to all members, then the existence of a gendered section with the same price could be seen as sexist. However, if the gym's structure is intended to correct past inequities and the author's objection is about the principle of equal access regardless of gender, both sides have valid points. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, as their reasoning is based on a principle of equal treatment. The girlfriend might be in a different position based on her own experiences and the purpose of the women-only section. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
