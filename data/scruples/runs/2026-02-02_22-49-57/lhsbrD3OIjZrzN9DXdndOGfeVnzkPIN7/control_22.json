Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym, which has a women-only section. The author is uncomfortable because the gym charges the same price for everyone but restricts access to certain equipment based on gender. They argue that it's sexist, and the girlfriend thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender in public accommodations. So if the gym is restricting access based on sex, that might be a legal issue. But some places allow single-sex facilities if they are separate and equal. For example, in the US, Title IX allows for single-sex facilities if they're justified by privacy or safety, but there's a difference between a completely separate section and just some equipment. Here, the women's section is 1/4 of the area and equipment. If the gym is providing equal access for men and women outside of that section, maybe it's not illegal. However, if the gym is taking away access for men to certain equipment, that could be a problem.\n\nThen, the ethical angle. The author is saying that being charged the same but not being able to use all the equipment is unfair. From their perspective, it's a form of discrimination. The girlfriend is defending it, saying it's different for women, perhaps because of historical or cultural reasons. But if the author is being denied access to a portion of the gym's facilities based on their gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is comparing it to the reverse scenario, which the girlfriend reacts negatively to. \n\nAnother point is whether the author is overreacting. The girlfriend might see the women-only section as empowering or necessary for women's comfort and safety, while the author sees it as exclusionary. However, if the gym allows women to have a space where they can work out without male presence, that's a legitimate need. But if the gym is charging men full price while limiting their access, that could be seen as unfair. The key is whether the restriction is justified. If the gym is providing equal value for both genders (e.g., men can use most equipment and have their own areas), then maybe it's acceptable. But if the restriction is arbitrary and reduces the value for men, it's a problem.\n\nAlso, the author's right to refuse to participate in an environment they find discriminatory. They might feel that supporting such a policy supports unequal treatment. The girlfriend's reaction that the author is \"being stupid\" might indicate a lack of understanding, but the author's stance is based on equality concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're pointing out a potential inconsistency or discrimination. Unless the gym's policy is legally justified or mutually agreed upon, the author has a valid concern. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's position could mean she's not considering his perspective adequately. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
