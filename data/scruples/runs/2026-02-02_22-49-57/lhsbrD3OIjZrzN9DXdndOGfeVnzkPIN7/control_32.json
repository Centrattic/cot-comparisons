Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym, but the author objects because the gym has a women-only section. The author argues that it's sexist since men can't use that part, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend thinks the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but women have a section that men can't access. The author is saying that's unfair because men are paying full price but can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend doesn't see it the same way, thinking it's different for women. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-segregated facilities can be allowed if they are optional, like a women-only gym section. However, the problem here is that the pricing is the same, but there's a partial exclusion. If the gym offered a discount for the limited access, that might be different. But since they charge the same, it could be seen as discriminatory based on sex. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in the US prohibits gender discrimination in public accommodations, so maybe this gym's policy could be problematic if it's not optional or if it's a standard practice without justification.\n\nThe author is pointing out a potential issue of unequal access despite equal pricing. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might stem from the idea that such sections are meant to make women feel safer, but that doesn't negate the fact that men are being excluded from a part of the facility. The author is challenging the fairness of the situation, which could be a valid concern. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the women-only section is a service the gym provides, and if the author doesn't want to use a gym that has such sections, that's a personal choice. But the key is that the gym isn't forcing them to use the women-only section; they can use the rest, but the author is upset about the exclusion. The girlfriend might feel that the women's section is necessary for her comfort and safety, which is a common argument in favor of such spaces. \n\nSo, the author is raising a legitimate equality concern, but the girlfriend values the women-only section for her own reasons. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to support this gym's policy. If the author is against gender-based restrictions, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of perspective and values. The answer might depend on the societal norms and laws regarding gender-segregated spaces. If it's legally permissible and the gym provides equal access otherwise, then the author's objection could be seen as a personal stance against such policies, which isn't necessarily being an asshole. But some might say the author is overreacting because the women-only section is a separate offering and doesn't affect the rest of the gym. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for pointing out what they perceive as an unfair policy. The situation is complex, but the author's concern about equal access for the same price is valid, so the answer is B.\n"
