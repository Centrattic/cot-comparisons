Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. Both he and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She suggests he join her gym for carpooling and working out together. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author is upset because he\u2019d have to pay full fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment. He compares it to asking her to pay the same but use less equipment, which she dismisses as not understanding the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here: the gym charges the same for everyone but restricts access to part of the facility based on gender. The author's argument is about fairness and equal access. He's not against the women-only section per se but against the idea of paying full price for less access. His girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to think that the situation is different for women, implying that the women-only section is justified, perhaps for safety or comfort reasons.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overreacting or if his reasoning is valid. From a fairness standpoint, if you pay the same as others but have restricted access, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, women-only spaces are often created to address historical underrepresentation and provide a safe environment for women in male-dominated spaces like gyms. So there's a balance between equal treatment and addressing specific needs.\n\nThe author's comparison might not hold because the women-only section is a separate area, not a restriction on men's access. Men can still use the remaining 75%, so they aren't being excluded from any equipment. The author is correct that if the women had to pay full price but use less equipment, that would be an issue, but in this case, the gym is offering a full facility to men and a part of it to women. However, the women-only section might be a benefit, not a restriction. If the author has access to the entire gym except the women-only section, he's actually getting more access than the women in that part.\n\nWait, but the author is paying for the entire gym but can't use a part. But in reality, gyms often have different sections or classes that members can choose to use or not. If the women-only section is optional, then the author isn't being restricted\u2014he can use the other 75%. So maybe his complaint is about something that isn't actually a restriction. The women-only section is for women's use, but men aren't being prevented from using the rest. The author's grievance is about not having access to the women-only part, but he can still use the majority of the gym.\n\nTherefore, the author is making a comparison that doesn't quite hold because the situation is asymmetrical. Women have a dedicated space, which is a positive, while men are not being excluded from anything. His argument is based on the assumption that he's being restricted, but he's not\u2014only women are restricted in that section. So perhaps the author is being unreasonable in his stance, thinking it's a restriction when it's actually a specific offer to women. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not being excluded and is misapplying the fairness argument.\n"
