Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they should work out at the same gym as their girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is with his girlfriend, and both like working out. They were going to different gyms before they got together. Now, the girlfriend wants to switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The issue is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up about 25% of the area and equipment. The author is objecting because he thinks it's sexist. He compares it to a scenario where a gym charges men the same but denies them access to part of the facilities, which he thinks the girlfriend would also find unfair. She gets upset and says it's different for women.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong for not wanting to go to a gym that restricts access based on gender, even if it's for women? The author's reasoning is about fairness and equality. He's saying that if a similar policy was applied to men, it would be considered discriminatory, so why is it okay when it's for women? The girlfriend seems to accept the women-only section as a separate thing, maybe for women's comfort or safety.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author is standing on the principle that equal treatment should be the same for all, regardless of gender. He sees the women-only section as a form of segregation that's unfair. On the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that the women-only section exists to provide a safe and comfortable space for women, which is a common argument in favor of such sections in gyms. She might feel that the author isn't understanding the need for that specific space.\n\nIs the author's stance valid? Well, if the gym is providing a service (the full gym access) but then restricting part of it based on gender, even though the fee is the same, that could be seen as discriminatory. From a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-based discrimination is prohibited, but there are exceptions for things like single-sex spaces for reasons of privacy, safety, or comfort. However, the author's argument is more about the principle of equal access. If the gym charges the same fee, shouldn't all paying members have equal access to all areas? That seems like a reasonable point.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which the author might find dismissive. It's possible that the girlfriend values the women-only section for reasons the author isn't considering, like feeling more comfortable in a space without male gym-goers. But the author's argument is that if the gym is charging the same amount, why can't he access all areas? That's a valid question. However, maybe the gym allows non-members to use the public areas but restricts certain sections only to members of a specific gender. Wait, the user mentioned that the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, so all members pay the same. The problem is that the author can't access a part of the gym that's reserved for women, even though he's paying the same as them. That does seem like a form of unequal treatment based on gender.\n\nBut then again, some people argue that women-only spaces are necessary to combat harassment or to provide a safe environment. The author isn't denying that, but he's pointing out the inconsistency in how discrimination is viewed. If a gym had a \"men only\" section and charged the same, it would be seen as sexist. So why is it okay for women? The author's analogy is that it's the same principle. The girlfriend might not see the analogy as valid because the context is different. The author's position is about fairness and equal access, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's position is about the necessity of the women-only section for women's needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym is indeed charging the same fee but not allowing equal access based on gender, then the author's stance is about equality and fairness, which is a valid position. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author's reasoning is logically consistent. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, it's also important to consider communication and understanding each other's perspectives. The author could be trying to explain his reasoning better, but his argument isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
