Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author doesn't want to join his girlfriend's gym because it has a \"women only\" section, which he finds sexist. His argument is that if the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender, it's unfair. The girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like certain yoga classes or sports teams, separate facilities exist for various reasons, such as comfort or safety. However, in a gym setting, if the gym is charging the same price but limiting access to equipment based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out an inconsistency: paying full price for less access.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective might be that the women's section exists to create a more welcoming environment for women, perhaps addressing issues like harassment or intimidation. But the author is arguing that this setup is sexist because it's giving preferential treatment to one gender by restricting the other's access without just cause.\n\nLegal and ethical standards often frown upon discrimination based on gender. If the gym is offering a service (the women's section) that's not available to men, but charging them the same, that could be problematic. The author isn't against the women's section per se, but the unequal access when paying the same fee. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances. Maybe the women's section is a voluntary option, and the rest of the gym is accessible to everyone. If the author can still use 75% of the equipment, maybe his objection is more about principle than practicality. But the key point he makes is about the disparity in access when paying full price, which touches on fairness.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women's section as necessary for women's comfort, which is a valid perspective in some contexts. But the author's stance is about equal treatment. If the gym's policy is discriminatory, he's justified in objecting. The question is whether his refusal to join is a legitimate stance or if he's overreacting.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and reasonableness. The author is standing by his principles regarding equal access, while the girlfriend is defending her need for a women-only space. If the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the women's section is a separate paid service or a minor part, maybe his objection is unwarranted. However, from the description, the gym charges the same fee but restricts access without justification, so the author's position seems reasonable.\n"
