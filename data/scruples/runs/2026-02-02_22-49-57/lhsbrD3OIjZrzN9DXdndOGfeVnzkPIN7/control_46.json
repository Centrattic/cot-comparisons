Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who both go to different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they both join her gym to carpool and work out together. The man is okay with that, but there's a problem: the gym has a \"women only\" section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The man objects because he feels it's unfair that he's paying the same fee but can't use all the equipment. His girlfriend says he doesn't understand and it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about gender equity and the justification for the women-only section. The man is arguing that it's sexist because he's paying the same as women but can't access all areas. The woman thinks it's different for women, implying that the women-only section is for their benefit, perhaps as a safe space.\n\nI should consider societal norms and the purpose of women-only spaces. Some people argue that women-only gyms or sections can be necessary to address historical imbalances in access to fitness facilities, where women might feel uncomfortable or face harassment in mixed environments. On the other hand, the man is being charged the same fee without access to all parts of the gym, which could be seen as a form of discrimination against him based on his sex.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If the gym is structured this way, it's a policy they both have to accept. The man is choosing not to comply because he feels it's unfair. However, the woman might see the women-only section as a necessary accommodation for women. The man is essentially saying that he won't join because he can't use all the facilities, which the woman might perceive as not supporting her choice or her needs.\n\nIs the man being sexist by not wanting to join a gym that limits his access? Or is he just standing up for his own rights? It's a bit of a tricky balance. The man's argument is about equal access for the same price. The woman's argument is about providing a safe space for women. The man might be unaware of the reasons behind the women-only section, or maybe he underestimates the necessity of such spaces for women.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, if the gym is charging the same for both genders but restricting access for one gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the women-only section is intended to address past inequalities, then the structure might be considered a form of affirmative action. The man is objecting to the structure of the gym, which the woman supports. The woman's upset reaction suggests that she sees the women-only section as important, and the man's refusal to join might be seen as not respecting her choice and the reasons behind it.\n\nAlternatively, the man is in the right because he's not being offered full access for his fee. But if the gym's policy is that everyone can use the mixed areas and women can use the exclusive area, then the man isn't being excluded from all areas. The women-only section is separate, so his access isn't restricted beyond the mixed areas. Therefore, he's still able to use the majority of the gym. The women-only section isn't preventing him from using the rest, just a quarter. So maybe his objection is overblown because he can still use 75% of the equipment, which is the same as before.\n\nIn terms of the question of sexism, the gym's policy is potentially sexist against men by limiting their access, but the intent of the policy is to address sexism against women. The man's stance is about equality of access, while the woman's is about creating a safe space. The man's not wrong for not wanting to support a gym that excludes men from certain areas if he's paying the same. However, the woman might see the women-only section as necessary, and the man's refusal could be seen as not respecting her needs.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong because he's pointing out a discrepancy in access for the same price. The gym's policy could be problematic, and it's valid for him to express discomfort with that. However, it's also about mutual understanding. The woman's perspective is valid too. The key is whether the author is being the asshole. Since he's not forcing her to change her gym or his, and he's explaining his reasoning, he's not wrong. The woman might need to explain why the women-only section is important, but the author isn't in the wrong for objecting to unequal access.\n"
