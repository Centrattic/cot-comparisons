Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section where only women can use a quarter of the equipment and area.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is about equal access based on the fee. If the gym charges the same amount regardless of gender but restricts access to certain areas based on sex, that seems like a problem. The author is comparing it to if women were charged the same as men but couldn't use part of the gym, which his girlfriend finds offensive. \n\nBut wait, the women-only section is a common feature in many gyms to create a safe space for women. Some people argue that this is a necessary accommodation to address historical imbalances or to make women feel more comfortable. However, the author is arguing that this is discriminatory because he's paying the same fee but not getting the same access. \n\nIs there a middle ground here? Maybe the gym allows men to use the rest of the facility but not the women-only section. That's similar to having separate hours or areas for different groups without excluding them entirely. But the author's issue is that he's being excluded from a portion of the gym based on his gender, which he finds sexist. \n\nLegally, in many countries, gender discrimination in public accommodations is prohibited. So if the gym is denying access based on sex, it could be problematic. However, exceptions might exist for women-only spaces for reasons like safety or fostering inclusivity. The key is whether the policy is justified by a legitimate purpose and is proportionate. \n\nThe author is drawing a parallel between his situation and what a woman would experience if the roles were reversed. His girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as beneficial, not discriminatory. He's questioning the fairness of such a policy, which leads to tension. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. From a legal standpoint, if the gym is allowed to have women-only sections, then the author's objection might be seen as not understanding the purpose. But from a fairness standpoint, if you pay the same fee but get less access, that's an issue. \n\nThe author isn't being sexist by pointing out inconsistency in treatment. He's applying the same standard he would expect for himself. His girlfriend, however, might see the women-only section as a positive discrimination to support women's comfort and safety. \n\nI think the author is justified in his stance because he's highlighting unequal access based on gender. Therefore, he's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
