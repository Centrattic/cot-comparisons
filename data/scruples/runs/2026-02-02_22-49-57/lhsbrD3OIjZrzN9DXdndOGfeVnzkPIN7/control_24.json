Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both work out, and she suggested they go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is the gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is upset that he has to pay the same fee but can't use that section, which is a quarter of the gym and equipment. He thinks it's sexist because if a man were charged the same but couldn't use part of the facilities, it would be unfair. But his girlfriend disagrees, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The author is making a point about fairness and equality. If a gym charges the same price but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, it could be seen as discriminatory. The author is drawing a parallel: if men were excluded from part of the gym, that would be considered unfair. So why is it okay for women to be excluded? He's arguing that the principle is the same, and it's sexist because it's based on gender, just in the opposite direction.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might be emphasizing the importance of safe spaces for women in a predominantly male environment. Gyms can sometimes be intimidating for women, and having a women-only section might help them feel more comfortable. From her perspective, this is about inclusion and safety, not exclusion. She might see it as a positive step towards addressing gender disparities in fitness spaces, where men often dominate. So, she might argue that it's not about charging the same but restricting access, but rather about providing a space where women can work out without feeling self-conscious or harassed.\n\nBut wait, the key point in the author's argument is the equality of access for the same price. If the gym charges both genders the same, but gives women a section that men can't use, isn't that effectively giving women more value for the same price? The author is paying full price but not getting access to all the equipment, while women do. That's a discrepancy. However, the gym might have structured the membership such that the price is for full access, but the women-only section is an additional benefit for female members. So, the price is the same, but the benefits differ based on gender. That could be a point of contention.\n\nBut then, if the gym is allowed to offer different benefits based on gender, is that inherently sexist? It might be seen as a way to correct historical imbalances, providing women with a space where they can feel more included. However, if the same logic were applied to men, would it be acceptable? If a gym had a \"men-only\" section that women couldn't access, and charged the same, would that be seen as okay? Probably not, because it would be discriminatory. So the author is pointing out the inconsistency. If the gym discriminates against men by not allowing them access to a section, it's unfair. But if they do the same for women, it's justified because it's \"different for women.\" That seems like a double standard.\n\nHowever, the context here is that the women-only section is likely intended to make women feel more comfortable, addressing a real issue in many gyms where women might feel intimidated or unwelcome. The author's argument is about equal treatment, but the girlfriend's perspective is about creating a more inclusive space for women. The question is whether the gym's policy is sexist. The author argues it is, based on the unequal treatment, while the girlfriend argues it's necessary and not sexist.\n\nIn terms of the author being the asshole, he's not being disrespectful; he's making a logical point about fairness. The girlfriend is being defensive and not engaging with his argument, just saying it's different without addressing the core issue. So maybe the author isn't wrong. But there's also the aspect of relationship dynamics. If this is causing conflict, maybe the author is overreacting, but the principle of the matter might still be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gym's policy isn't as discriminatory as the author thinks. If the women-only section is separate but the men are still free to use the rest of the gym, then the author isn't being excluded entirely. He's just not getting access to a part of the gym that's reserved for women. But the price is the same, so he's paying for access he doesn't get. That's a problem. If the gym wanted to charge less for men, that would be one thing, but they charge the same. So the author's point about fairness is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is a necessary accommodation, and the author isn't considering the underlying reasons. The question is whether the policy is sexist. If it's intended to address a real issue (women feeling unwelcome), then maybe it's not sexist but a form of affirmative action. However, the same logic would require that such accommodations are made for other groups as well, but in this case, it's gender-specific. So the author is pointing out the inconsistency in how gender-based restrictions are treated.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. He's raising a valid point about equal treatment and fairness. The girlfriend's response is dismissive without addressing the logic, so the author's position is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
