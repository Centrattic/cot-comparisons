Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. \n\nThe situation is that the girlfriend suggested they both go to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The author is okay with that, but the issue is the gym has a large women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but the women-only section takes up a quarter of the space and equipment.\n\nThe author argues that it's unfair because they'd pay full price but only have access to 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable and says it's different for women. The author is questioning if he's wrong for not seeing this as okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles here. The author's main point is about equal access. If you pay the same fee, you should have access to the same facilities. The gym is giving women a separate area, which effectively restricts men from that section. From the author's perspective, it's like saying you pay full price but can't use all the equipment. That seems like a legitimate complaint about unequal access based on gender.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the women-only section as a safe space for women, which is a common argument. But the author is pointing out that the gym is charging them equally yet limiting access. That could be seen as discriminatory against men because they can't use the same portion. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym allows women a separate space but doesn't offer men the same, that's a problem. However, if the gym is allowing women a space without restricting men's access elsewhere, but the author is being denied access to the women-only section, then the author isn't being discriminated against. Wait, but the author is a man, so the women-only section isn't for him. But the author is paying to use the entire gym, and the gym is withholding a portion from him based on his gender. That seems like a form of gender discrimination because he's being excluded from a part of the facility that others aren't. \n\nThe author's analogy is valid: if a woman had to pay the same but couldn't use certain equipment, that would be a problem. So the author is applying the same standard. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might be a double standard. If the gym allows women-only spaces but doesn't have similar spaces for men, it's not equal. The author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't wrong. The gym's policy is discriminatory if it restricts access based on gender. The author's refusal to support that is reasonable. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author's stance is about equal treatment. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
