Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The key points here are about equality and perceptions of sexism.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the gym charges everyone the same fee but restricts access to 25% of the equipment for men. That seems like a problem with equal access, right? If you pay the same price but get less access, that's a valid concern. The author is pointing out inconsistency\u2014if the gym allows a women-only section, why can't men use that area too? It's about fairness and equal treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues it's different for women. Maybe she feels that the women-only section is necessary for her comfort or safety. Some women prefer spaces where they can work out without male presence, which is a legitimate perspective. But the author's counterpoint is that this exclusion is unfair from his side as a man. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author isn't opposing the women-only section itself, which is a choice the gym makes. The problem is the unequal access for men. If the gym allows a section that women can use exclusively, but men can't access that same area, why can't women use all the equipment when men are allowed in the main area? It's a symmetry problem. The author is pointing out that the same rule isn't applied both ways, leading to inequality.\n\nSo, the author isn't being sexist by pointing out the inconsistency. They're highlighting that the gym's policy is discriminatory against men in the opposite direction. The girlfriend's frustration might come from not seeing the symmetry in the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
