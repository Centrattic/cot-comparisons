Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The author is reluctant to switch to that gym because he feels it's sexist\u2014charging the same fee but limiting access based on gender. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: gender-based segregation in a shared facility. The gym is charging the same for both men and women but offers a section exclusively for women. The author's argument is about fairness\u2014why should men have full access to all areas for the same price, while women don't? That seems like a valid point about equal treatment.\n\nHowever, the women-only section might exist for reasons like safety or comfort, which are often cited by gyms. Women might feel more comfortable in a space without men, especially in changing areas or certain equipment sections. The girlfriend's reaction that it's \"different for women\" could stem from these considerations. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the gym is open to all and the women-only section is just a part of it, then the existence of that section shouldn't discriminate against men. The author's stance is that he's being treated unfairly by being excluded from part of the gym. The girlfriend might see it as a necessary provision for women's comfort. \n\nThe key question is whether the segregation is a form of discrimination. If the gym allows women to use part of the facility and men can use the rest, but both pay the same, it's a form of sex-based discrimination. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which could be a valid critique of the gym's policy rather than a personal issue.\n\nBut maybe the author's approach is too confrontational. He's questioning his girlfriend's perspective and implying she's wrong, which could be why she's upset. However, the underlying issue might not be about the relationship but about the gym's policy. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for recognizing a potential fairness issue; he's just challenging a situation that might be perpetuating unequal treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, if the gym's policy is designed to protect women's rights to certain spaces, then the author's refusal to switch might be about his principle versus the girlfriend's needs. It's a balance between personal principles and relationship dynamics. The girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is important for her, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her needs.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, in many places, gender segregation in public facilities is allowed if it's based on privacy or safety. So the gym might have legal grounds for the women-only section. But the author's argument is about equal access for men, which could be seen as a different perspective. However, if the gym is a co-ed space with optional segregated areas, the author's objection might be valid.\n\nUltimately, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how one views the purpose of the women-only section. If it's a necessary accommodation for women, then the author's stance might lack empathy. But if the segregation is discriminatory, he's right to point it out. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she values that aspect, so the author's refusal could be a matter of principle, but it's also affecting their relationship. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is highlighting a fairness issue, even if the execution is causing tension.\n"
