Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author doesn't want to switch gyms with his girlfriend because her gym has a women-only section. He argues that it's sexist since men would be paying the same fee but can't use that quarter of the gym. His girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the author is upset. He's saying that the gym charges everyone the same, but restricts access to certain areas based on sex. That does seem like a form of discrimination, right? If you pay the same, you should have the same access. But wait, the women-only section might be there to provide a safer space for women, which is a common reason for such sections in gyms. So maybe there's a different intent here.\n\nThe author's argument is about equal access. If the gym charges the same but limits what men can use, that's unequal treatment. His girlfriend's response was that it's different for women, which might be her way of saying that the women-only section serves a purpose, like safety or comfort, which isn't the same for men. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency in the pricing and access.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for not wanting to go to a gym that discriminates against men? Or is he justified in feeling that the gym's policy is sexist? The key here is whether the gym's policy is fair. If the women-only section is a privilege for women, then men aren't being discriminated against\u2014they're just not getting that privilege. But the author is being charged the same as women but not getting the same access, which could be seen as reverse discrimination.\n\nHowever, sometimes these sections are meant to address historical imbalances or provide a space where women feel more comfortable. The author's analogy of asking his girlfriend if she would go to a gym that forbids her from using part of the equipment is a valid point. If he's being asked to accept a lesser access, why would she accept that in the opposite scenario?\n\nThe girlfriend getting upset and saying he's being stupid might indicate she doesn't see the issue the same way. But does that mean the author is wrong? Or is the author just trying to highlight a double standard?\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym allows women to have a section that men can't use, but men don't have a similar privilege, that does create a disparity. The author's stance is about equal treatment under the same fee. So, if the gym is structurally unequal in access, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but that doesn't negate the author's valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policies regarding equal access when there's a gender-based restriction on equipment use without a corresponding restriction for men.\n"
