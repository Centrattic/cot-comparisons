Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to join the same gym as his girlfriend because of the \"women only\" section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both he and his girlfriend work out and have been at different gyms. She suggests he switch to her gym for convenience. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author is upset because men would pay the same fee but can't use that section. He points out the inconsistency, and the girlfriend gets upset, saying it's different for women.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is about perceived fairness and gender-specific spaces. The author is arguing that it's sexist because men pay the same but get less access. The girlfriend is defending the women-only section, implying that it's not the same for women, maybe because they need such spaces for comfort or safety.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author's reasoning is based on equal access for equal price. If a gym charges everyone the same but restricts part of the facility based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. But the woman-only areas in gyms are often created to provide a space where women can work out without the pressure or discomfort of being around men, which is a common concern. These areas aren't about excluding men from paying but about creating a safe, inclusive environment for women.\n\nThe author might not be considering the reasons behind the women-only section. He's focusing on the access versus payment, while the girlfriend is emphasizing the need for that specific space. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels the author doesn't understand the importance of such spaces for women, which is a valid feminist argument. However, the author is also pointing out a potential inconsistency in how access is handled based on gender.\n\nIs it sexist? If the gym is charging the same fee but effectively giving different access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. But the premise of the women-only section is to serve a different purpose, not to provide equal access in the same way. So maybe the author is missing the intent behind the section. On the other hand, if the gym is structuring their pricing without considering the differential access, that's a problem.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's objection is valid. If the gym is providing a service that's divided based on gender, then perhaps the author is correct in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the existence of women-only spaces is often justified as a way to address systemic issues like harassment or discomfort, which are real issues. The author might not be considering that the value of the women-only section isn't just the equipment but the experience it provides. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It might depend on the intent and understanding. If the author is dismissing the need for women-only spaces without recognizing their purpose, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's genuinely pointing out a fairness issue based on equal access, he has a point. However, the existence of such sections is a common practice, and the pricing model might not be the primary concern here. The girlfriend's frustration is about the author not understanding the necessity of the women-only area, which is a valid perspective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but his approach could be improved by understanding the rationale behind the women-only sections instead of just focusing on the access discrepancy.\n"
