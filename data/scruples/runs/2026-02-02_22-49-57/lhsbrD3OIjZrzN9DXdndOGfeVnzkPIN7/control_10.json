Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section.\n\nThe author's main issue is the gym's practice of charging everyone the same fee but restricting access to 25% of the equipment for men. They compare it to a hypothetical situation where a woman would be charged the same but barred from using most of the gym. The girlfriend disagrees, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, the argument is about equal access and fairness. The gym is effectively providing different value for the same price. If the women-only section is a form of segregation based on gender, that's a problem. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if a woman were in the same situation, that would be discrimination. But when it's the other way around, the gym isn't charging higher for men but restricting their access. That's a form of reverse discrimination, perhaps?\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might stem from a desire to create safe spaces for women in a male-dominated environment. Gyms are often perceived as male-centric, and having a women-only area can make women feel more comfortable. However, the author's point is valid because the gym isn't offering equal access to all members. They pay the same price but don't get the same facilities. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're not attacking their girlfriend but pointing out a logical inconsistency. The girlfriend's refusal to see the comparison might stem from a different perspective, but the author isn't being unreasonable here. The issue is about equal treatment, which is a legitimate concern. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
