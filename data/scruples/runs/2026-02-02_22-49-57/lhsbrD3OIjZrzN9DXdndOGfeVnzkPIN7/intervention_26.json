Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both like working out, but they've been going to different gyms. The girlfriend wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section which takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author is upset because he feels it's sexist to charge the same fee but limit men to 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend thinks he's being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the \"women only\" section exists. Many gyms have these sections to provide a safe and comfortable space for women, especially in a male-dominated environment. It's often about safety and reducing harassment. So, the gym's intention might be to create an inclusive area for women, not necessarily to discriminate against men. But the author's argument is about paying the same fee for less access. That's a fair point, right? If you pay the same but can't use all the areas, it feels like you're not getting equal value. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory or not. The \"women only\" section is a specific area, not the entire gym. So, men can still use the other 75% of the equipment and areas. The author isn't being excluded from the entire gym, just a part of it. The girlfriend might be in a space that's designed for her comfort and safety, which are valid concerns. \n\nBut the author is arguing that it's sexist because it's a flat fee but restricted access. Is that a valid point? On one hand, the gym offers a space for women, which is a common practice. On the other, if the fee is the same for everyone, regardless of access, that could be seen as unfair. However, the existence of a women-only section doesn't inherently mean the gym is sexist. It's more about addressing specific needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it's \"different for women,\" which could imply that she understands the need for such spaces, maybe from her own experiences. The author's analogy is that if the situation were reversed, he would be upset. But the difference here is that the women-only section is a choice. The gym isn't forcing men to use only 75% of the facility. The author can still use the other areas. So, maybe the issue is about the value of the fee versus the access. \n\nIs the author overreacting? If he's okay with the other 75% of the gym, then maybe not. But if he values full access for the same price, then that's a valid concern. The girlfriend might not be considering the author's perspective, thinking that since he can use the other areas, the women-only section is just for her. But the author sees it as an unfair policy because of the equal fee. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the gym's policy is seen as discriminatory. Since the women-only section is a specific area and not the entire gym, and the fee is the same for all members, the author's issue is more about the perceived fairness of the fee structure. However, the existence of such sections is often to meet the needs of a demographic that might feel uncomfortable in a co-ed environment. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but the girlfriend's need for a women-only space is also valid. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym's policy is acceptable and the author is just not understanding the rationale, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's raising a fair point about equitable access for the same fee, then he's not. I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because his perspective is about fairness and equal value. The girlfriend's response that he's being stupid might be dismissive without considering his valid point. However, the women-only section is a common practice, so maybe the author is missing the context of why it exists. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to go there because he thinks it's sexist. I think his reasoning is flawed because the gym isn't entirely restricted to women, but his feeling of being treated unfairly about the fee is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
