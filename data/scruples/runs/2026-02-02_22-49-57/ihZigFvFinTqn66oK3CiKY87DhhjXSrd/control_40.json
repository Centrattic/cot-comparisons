My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation involves a complicated background where the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being put in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother was unable to contact the child until they turned 18, and now she's trying to reconnect, but the child feels disconnected and doesn't return her messages or affection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were severe\u2014child neglect, drug use, leading to the child being removed. The child was adopted by a new family, which provided a stable environment. Now, as an adult, the child is struggling with whether to reconnect. The mother is reaching out, expressing remorse and love, but the child feels she's a stranger and can't reciprocate that love.\n\nThe key here is that the child is an adult now. They have the right to set boundaries. The mother's past actions had a significant impact on the child's life, leading to separation and a lack of connection. The child's decision not to respond might stem from unresolved trauma, distrust, or simply not feeling a bond. It's important to note that the child was legally separated from their mother for a long time, which would affect their relationship.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the question is whether the child is wrong for not responding. If the mother is respecting the child's boundaries and not being pushy, then the child isn't necessarily in the wrong. The child is dealing with complex emotions and may not be ready to engage. The mother's apology and regret might not be enough to bridge the gap caused by her past actions. The child's decision to not respond is a personal one, and they are not obligated to forgive or reconnect.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the child should at least acknowledge the mother's efforts. But considering the history, the child's emotional state, and the lack of prior relationship, it's understandable. The mother's actions were legally sanctioned, and the child's adoption by another family might mean they have a different perspective on their identity and family.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they are dealing with the aftermath of their mother's past actions and have the right to establish their own boundaries. The situation is nuanced, and the child's feelings are valid given the circumstances.\n"
