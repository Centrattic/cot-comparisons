My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The situation is complex with a history of neglect and abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The author was adopted and had a good relationship with their adoptive parents. At 18, the mother reconnected, but the author found out she couldn't provide answers about their heritage and had used drugs during pregnancy. Since then, the author hasn't spoken to her, even though the mother sends messages expressing love and regret.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for not responding. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. The mother had a significant role in their early trauma, and the author hasn't received closure or answers. The mother's actions caused lasting harm, and the author's decision to cut off contact might be a way to protect themselves emotionally. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends, and the author's silence could be seen as rejecting her efforts. But considering the history, the author isn't obligated to respond. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a painful past. \n\nThe mother's messages might be well-intentioned, but the author isn't required to reciprocate love or engagement if they haven't resolved their feelings. The adoptive parents provided a stable environment, which is crucial. The author's actions stem from a place of hurt and a need for self-preservation. \n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong). The situation isn't straightforward, but the author's decisions are rooted in their traumatic experiences, and they have the right to prioritize their emotional well-being.\n"
