My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They explain a lot of their backstory: their mom was arrested when they were six for neglect and drug use, which led to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. After turning 18, they reconnected with their mom, but found out she didn't know their father or nationality. The mom is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the author can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. I need to decide based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their birth mother, who abandoned them and used drugs during pregnancy. They were in foster care and adopted, so their current parents are their real family. The birth mom was away for a long time and couldn't contact them legally. When they reunited, the author learned the mom had many children, most of whom didn't meet their fathers. The author feels hurt and disconnected because their mom didn't know their father's identity or nationality, which adds to their sense of loss and confusion.\n\nThe author isn't responding to their mom's messages, which include \"I love you\" and other expressions of affection. The mom is trying to make amends, but the author is struggling with forgiveness and acceptance. The author's reasoning is that their mom is a stranger now, and they can't find it in themselves to love her back. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not responding? Well, in terms of right or wrong, emotions and personal boundaries play a big role here. The author has every right to set boundaries, especially given the history. The mom's actions were harmful, and the author's feelings of not being ready to engage are valid. The fact that they are not responding could be seen as cutting off someone trying to reconnect, but considering the circumstances, it's more about healing and personal choice.\n\nThere's no clear \"wrong\" here. The author isn't harming their mom by not responding; they're protecting their emotional well-being. The mom might feel rejected, but that's part of the process of rebuilding trust, which can't be forced. The author's decision to not reciprocate love is a personal one, and they don't owe their mom emotional validation unless they choose to. So, the answer is B.\n"
