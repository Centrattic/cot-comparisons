My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't responded to their mom's messages, even though the mom has reached out with love and apologies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the child was 6. She was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. The child was in a foster home and then adopted, which gives them a different family now. After turning 18, the mother contacted them, but the author felt let down by her lack of answers about their past. Now, the mom keeps reaching out, but the author can't bring themselves to respond with love.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is justified. The mother's actions had severe consequences, leading to the child's removal and a long separation. The child's emotional response is understandable given the trauma and the lack of closure or answers they received. The author's decision to not respond could be seen as a form of self-protection, not an act of cruelty. The mom's efforts to reconnect are commendable, but the author's right to set boundaries is important too.\n\nLegally and ethically, the mother made choices that led to her son's suffering. The son is within his rights to choose how to handle their relationship. Not responding to messages isn't necessarily wrong if it's for his emotional well-being. The key here is the child's need to heal and protect themselves from potential emotional harm. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but because they can't form a bond with a stranger who caused them pain. So, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
