My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author hasn't responded to their mother's texts for four years. The mother has a history of drug abuse and neglect, and wasn't allowed to contact the author until they were 18. When they reconnected, the mother expressed regret, but the author feels unable to reconnect emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were severe\u2014child neglect, drug abuse during pregnancy, and being absent for years. The author was placed in foster care and adopted, which is a significant part of their identity. Reconnecting with a parent who was absent for such critical years isn't straightforward. The author's hesitation or refusal to engage might stem from deep emotional wounds and a lack of trust.\n\nThe mother, while expressing remorse and being clean now, is still a stranger in many ways to the author. The author's response (or lack thereof) could be a protective measure, not wanting to reopen old wounds or deal with someone who caused harm. It's not just about ignoring messages, but about processing complex emotions and deciding how to handle a relationship that was built on absence and neglect.\n\nSocietally, there's often pressure to forgive and reconnect, especially with family. But forgiveness isn't a requirement for healing. The author's feelings are valid. They might not be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. The mother's actions were harmful, and the author has the right to set boundaries or choose not to engage if that's what they need.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being unkind by not responding. But considering the circumstances, the author's actions are a personal choice in dealing with their trauma. They might not be ready to connect, and that's okay. The mother's outreach is important, but the author's healing process is equally valid.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are a reaction to historical harm and personal emotional needs, not a simple refusal to communicate without reason.\n"
