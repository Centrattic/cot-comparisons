My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The person's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was placed in foster care and adopted by a new family they love. The mom was legally barred from contacting them until they turned 18. After that, she tried to reconnect, shared some difficult truths about their background, and the author hasn't really responded since.\n\nThe author hasn't returned any love or affectionate messages from their mom for four years. The question is whether they're an asshole for doing that. \n\nFrom what I can see, the author has a lot of valid reasons for their feelings. Their mom abandoned them, used drugs during pregnancy, and they were separated for years. The author is now an adult and has the right to set boundaries, especially given the trauma they experienced. The mom's attempts at reconciliation might be heartfelt, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love if they feel it's not genuine or if they're not ready. \n\nAlso, the author is still figuring out their identity and might feel conflicted about their biological mother. The fact that the mom is clean and has found religion is positive, but past actions can't be undone. The author's decision not to engage in a loving relationship isn't necessarily wrong, especially if they're dealing with unresolved feelings.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that cutting off communication entirely could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, the author is protecting their emotional well-being. They have the right to decide how to handle their relationship, regardless of how the mother feels. The key here is consent and emotional readiness. The author isn't being cruel by ignoring texts; they're setting boundaries after years of being unable to connect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to not reciprocate and are prioritizing their own mental health.\n"
