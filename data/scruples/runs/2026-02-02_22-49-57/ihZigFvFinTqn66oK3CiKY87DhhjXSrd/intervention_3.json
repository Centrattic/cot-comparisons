My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author hasn't seen their mom since they were 6, when she was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. She couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, they connected via Facebook, learned some hard truths about their past, and now she's trying to reach out again with love messages, but the author isn't responding.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. Their mom was absent for most of their life, had serious issues with drug abuse, and left them in foster care. The author was adopted by a loving family, which probably helped them grow up okay despite the challenges. When they finally reconnect, the mom isn't able to provide the answers the author seeks and has a history of substance abuse. The author feels conflicted, maybe even hurt by the mom's inability to give them a stable, present life. So, not responding might be a way to protect themselves from further emotional pain or to set boundaries after years of absence.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is now trying to reconnect, is clean, and shows remorse. She's reaching out with love and support, which could be genuine. From her viewpoint, she's trying to make amends and build a relationship now that she's in a better place. But the author hasn't known her for long and might not trust her intentions. The author's hesitation is understandable given the history.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Emotional support is important, but the author has the right to decide how they want to handle this relationship. They might not feel ready to engage, especially since their mom wasn't part of their life when they needed her most. Not responding doesn't necessarily mean they're a bad person; it could be a reflection of their current emotional state and past experiences.\n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation here. The author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel comfortable. The mom initiated contact after a long absence, so the onus might be on her to respect the author's boundaries. The author isn't ignoring someone who was present in their life; they're dealing with a parent who was absent and now is trying to reconnect. It's a complex situation involving trust and emotional healing.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision not to respond is a personal choice based on their history. They aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and setting boundaries after years of neglect and absence.\n"
