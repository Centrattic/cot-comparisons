My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't responded to their mother's messages, even though she's reaching out with love and apologies.\n\nFirst, the backstory is important. The mother was involved in serious issues like child neglect and drug abuse, leading to her son being placed in foster care and adoption. The author was legally separated from her until 18. That's a significant time gap and traumatic experience. When the mother reconnects, she's honest about her past but the son feels disconnected because he doesn't know much about his heritage or father. \n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions and the son's current emotional response. The mother is trying to rebuild the relationship, but the son sees her as a stranger. The son isn't responding because he can't forgive or connect with her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the son is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, while the mother is trying to reconcile, the son has valid reasons for his feelings. He's been through trauma and hasn't had a relationship with her. Not responding isn't necessarily wrong because healing takes time, and he's not obligated to reciprocate love immediately. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the son is within his rights to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring her completely could be seen as cutting off a potential relationship. But given the context, the son hasn't had a real relationship with her to lose. The mother initiated contact after years of absence, and the son's lack of response is a reaction to that. It's a complex situation where the son's emotional state and history play a big role. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. He's dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and trauma, and his choice to not engage is a personal one that doesn't make him the asshole.\n"
