My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts over four years. The situation involves a complicated history of neglect, drug abuse, and estrangement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the child being placed in foster care and adoption. There's a significant emotional trauma here. When the mother reconnected after 18, she admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. The author is struggling with feelings of betrayal and confusion.\n\nThe key point is the author's decision to ignore the mother's messages. They feel it's hard to love someone who caused them harm and who they now see as a stranger. The mother claims to have changed, being clean and involved in a church, but the author hasn't forgiven her yet. \n\nI should evaluate if the author is obligated to respond. Emotional healing takes time, especially after such trauma. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely but isn't reciprocating affection. It's about their right to set boundaries. The mother's actions in the past are unforgivable from the author's perspective. The author's current behavior is a response to years of neglect and abuse. \n\nSociety often expects children to maintain a relationship with parents, but in cases of severe abuse or neglect, it's understandable that someone might need distance. The author isn't being cruel by not responding; they're processing their pain. The mother initiated contact, but the author is under no obligation to engage if it's harmful to their mental health. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're dealing with the aftermath of traumatic experiences and setting necessary boundaries.\n"
