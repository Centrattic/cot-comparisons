My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the kid had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six. They were put in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. When she did, it was emotional but also left the kid with more questions and unresolved feelings. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the kid feels like they can't love her back because she's a stranger. They don't respond to her messages, and the question is if that makes them the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom is trying to reach out, showing she's clean and sorry. But the kid has a valid reason for not wanting to reconnect immediately. They were taken away as a child, had no real contact, and now are dealing with trust issues and emotional scars. The kid's actions are a result of trauma and not just a lack of care. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is making efforts to stay in touch, expressing love and regret. But the kid isn't in the wrong for not responding yet. They need time to heal and decide if they want a relationship. It's about their well-being. The kid isn't ignoring texts out of spite; it's because they can't process all that happened. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with past trauma and haven't decided to reconnect. The mom's actions are positive, but the kid's emotional state is valid. No one is the asshole here, but the question is about the author specifically. Their choice to not respond is understandable given their history.\n"
