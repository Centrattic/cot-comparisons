My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Their mom had a lot of issues in the past, like drug abuse and neglect, leading to the person being put in foster care and then adopted. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the person feels distant because they don't know her and can't forgive past actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's history is really bad, and the person had their life turned upside down. They were separated by legal means and couldn't contact her until 18. Now, she's reaching out, but the person feels she's a stranger. They want answers about their identity and origin, but the mom doesn't have them. That must be painful. The person isn't responding to her messages, which the mom is trying to make amends for.\n\nIs not responding the wrong thing to do? Well, the mom is trying to be part of their life again. But the person has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. They might feel anger, betrayal, or confusion. The fact that the mom didn't take responsibility for her actions earlier, and now is trying to reconnect after so long could make the person hesitant. Also, the person might not be ready to forgive or open up. \n\nHowever, the mom is reaching out, expressing love and regret. The person isn't ignoring the emotional aspect, but they're choosing not to reciprocate. Is that being an asshole? It's complicated. The person's feelings are valid given the history. They might need time to process everything. The mom's actions were harmful, and expecting immediate reconciliation might not be fair. \n\nBut on the other hand, completely ignoring someone who is trying to rebuild a relationship might be seen as cutting them off. However, the person might not want to have a relationship. The line between being in the right and the wrong here is blurry. The person isn't being cruel, just not engaging. They have their reasons rooted in past trauma. I think the answer is B \u2013 the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re dealing with their own emotions and history, and it's their choice how to handle the relationship. The mom's actions don't give her the right to expect love or forgiveness immediately. The person's struggle is understandable.\n"
