My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is complicated. The mom had a history of drug abuse, was arrested for child neglect, and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. Now that they can, she's trying to reconnect, but the author feels hurt and doesn't know how to respond.\n\nFirst, the user's background is crucial. Their mom was absent, had legal issues, and they were in foster care. The adoption by a loving family might explain their current emotional state. The mom is now trying to reconnect, but the user hasn't responded because of past trauma and not feeling a connection anymore.\n\nThe key points are the history of neglect and abuse, the sudden attempt to reconnect after so long, and the user's justified feelings of resentment and confusion. The user isn't ignoring out of spite but because they're struggling with their identity and past. They don't owe their mother love or forgiveness, especially after years of absence and the trauma caused.\n\nThe question is whether ignoring the texts makes the user wrong. Since they have valid emotional reasons and haven't blocked her, just not engaging, it's a personal choice. The mother's actions in the past are the main issue here. The user's response is a way to protect themselves emotionally. So, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
