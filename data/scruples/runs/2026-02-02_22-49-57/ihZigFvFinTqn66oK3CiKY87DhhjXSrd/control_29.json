My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The person is being accused of ignoring messages of love and affection from their mother. The key points to consider are the background and the context of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being placed in foster care. The mother couldn't contact the child until they were 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, and the child had many unanswered questions about their identity. The mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the child's father or nationality. The child now doesn't respond to her messages, finding her a stranger despite her apologies and efforts.\n\nThe author hasn't responded because of the traumatic past and the lack of a real connection. They're struggling with feelings of resentment and confusion. The mother is now clean and religious, but the author can't find it in their heart to reciprocate love or engage. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the author's reaction is understandable given the history. The mother abandoned them, and the sudden contact after so many years might be overwhelming. The author's right to set boundaries and their emotional response is valid. The mother's actions in the past have caused lasting harm, and the author's decision not to engage could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nSocietally, people might argue that the mother is trying to make amends, so the author should give her a chance. However, the author's experience and trauma are significant factors. They might need time to process and decide whether to reconnect, if at all. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to respond. The mother's actions in the past don't entitle her to immediate forgiveness or a response. The author has the right to prioritize their mental health and well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's intentions might be genuine, the author's choice to not respond is a personal decision based on their history. They are not in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional needs and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
