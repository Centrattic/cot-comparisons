My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author's mom had a history of drug abuse, neglect, and was arrested when the author was six. They were separated, and the author was adopted. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect but the author hasn't responded, leading to the question if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother, being removed from her care and placed in foster care. The mother's actions led to the author being separated from her for many years. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels disconnected because the mother admitted to not knowing certain things about the author's father and heritage, which adds to the emotional pain.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past behavior, the legal separation, and the author's current emotional state. The author is justified in feeling hurt and not being ready to reconnect. It's important to recognize that healing from such trauma takes time. The mother's efforts to reach out might be genuine, but the author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel ready. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite but because of unresolved feelings and trust issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother is now clean and in a church, which shows she's made changes, but the author's right to set boundaries is valid. The fact that the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact shows that the lack of communication isn't just ignoring texts but a refusal to engage further. The author's decision to not reciprocate love texts is rooted in the history of abandonment and lack of knowledge about their own identity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a difficult past and have the right to prioritize their emotional well-being.\n"
