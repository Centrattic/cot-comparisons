My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person hasn't responded to their mom's love texts for four years after reconnecting. The mom had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to the child being in foster care. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels distant and can't return the love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a very traumatic start with their mother. Being taken away at 6, not knowing their father, and the mother's drug abuse during pregnancy. That's a lot of emotional baggage. The mom was legally separated and couldn't contact them until 18. Now, after reconnecting, the author is struggling to accept her again. The mom is clean and trying to make amends, but the author feels she's a stranger.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Well, the author's feelings are valid given their history. They've been through a lot, and it's understandable that they might not feel love or want to reconnect immediately. The mom did abandon them and caused significant harm. The author's decision to not respond isn't out of malice, but from a place of emotional protection. The mom initiated contact, and while she's expressing love, the author isn't in a place to reciprocate. \n\nBut then, maybe there's an argument that the author should make an effort to connect, given the mom is trying to make amends. However, the author isn't ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved trauma. Also, the relationship was severed due to legal reasons, not just by choice. The author's current family provided a stable environment, which they love. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't being an asshole for not responding. They're dealing with complex emotions and trauma. The answer should be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
