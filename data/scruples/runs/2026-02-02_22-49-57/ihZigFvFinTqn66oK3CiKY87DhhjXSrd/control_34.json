My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother was involved in child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and later adopted. The mother couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. After recontact, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels no emotional connection and refuses to respond.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the mother was absent and had a troubled past. The author's feelings of resentment and lack of trust are understandable given the circumstances. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful, and the author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is showing remorse and trying to make amends. But the author's trauma and the lack of a real relationship might mean that expecting them to respond is unreasonable. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a significant absence and neglect.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
