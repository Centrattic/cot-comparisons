My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The person hasn't responded to their mom's messages for four years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she was apologetic but didn't have answers about their heritage or father. Now, the mom reaches out with love messages, but the author ignores them, feeling she's a stranger despite her apologies and attempts to reconnect.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment and neglect, the author's trauma, and the current emotional conflict. The author is struggling to forgive and reconnect with a mother who was absent for so long and responsible for their painful past. The mom is clean now, religious, and trying to make amends, but the author feels no obligation to reciprocate love or messages.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. The author's feelings are valid given their upbringing. They've been hurt and may not feel safe to open up. However, the mom is making efforts to rebuild the relationship. But considering the lack of contact for 18 years and the reasons behind the neglect, the author's hesitation makes sense. They're not obligated to respond, especially if it's causing them emotional distress. So, the answer is more about understanding the author's perspective rather than judging them as wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
