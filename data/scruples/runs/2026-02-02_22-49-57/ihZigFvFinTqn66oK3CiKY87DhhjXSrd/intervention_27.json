My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages for four years. The author has a complicated background. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. After reconnecting via Facebook, the author learned more about their mother's past, which was distressing, and now the mother sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and psychological aspects. The author has been through significant trauma, being separated from their biological mother during a formative age and then reconnecting with someone who caused that trauma. The mother's actions had severe consequences, and the author's lack of response could stem from unresolved feelings of anger, betrayal, or difficulty in forming a relationship with someone who caused them harm. It's important to note that healing from such experiences takes time, and the author's decision not to engage might be a coping mechanism.\n\nThe mother's perspective is that she's trying to rebuild a relationship, expressing remorse and a desire to be part of the author's life. However, from the author's viewpoint, the mother is a stranger who contributed to their pain. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond, especially if doing so would be emotionally harmful. The key here is the author's emotional well-being versus the mother's efforts to reconnect.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a history. The mother initiating contact after years of absence and the author's right to choose how to handle that contact is a personal matter. The author isn't required to reciprocate love or acknowledge messages if it's not healing for them. It's about their autonomy and emotional health.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's current relationships with their adoptive parents, who provided a stable environment. The author's loyalty and attachments might lie more with those who supported them during their upbringing, which is understandable.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to respond. They've experienced trauma and are navigating complex emotions. The decision to not engage isn't a moral failing but a personal choice influenced by their history. The mother's actions in the past and the current dynamic play a significant role here. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
