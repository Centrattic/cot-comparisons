My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for purposefully ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, which led to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mom was legally barred from contacting the author until they turned 18. When she did reach out, the author wanted answers but felt let down because the mom couldn't provide much information. Now, the mom is clean, has found religion, and wants to reconnect, but the author can't bring themselves to reciprocate the love or respond to her messages.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on the details provided.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, a parent's neglect and drug abuse during the child's early years are significant. The author's decision to cut off contact might stem from a place of self-protection and unresolved trauma. The mom's actions were harmful and had long-term effects, so the author's reluctance to reconnect isn't unreasonable. Also, the author is not ignoring someone who has been a consistent, supportive parent. The mom is now trying to rebuild the relationship, but the author's feelings are valid given the history. The author isn't being cruel by not responding; they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author could be more open-minded, considering the mom is trying to make amends. However, the author's experience of being neglected and abandoned makes their hesitation understandable. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when dealing with someone who caused them harm. There's no obligation to forgive or reconnect, especially if it's not in their best interest. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're grappling with deep emotional scars and are making choices that protect their mental health. The answer should be B.\n"
