My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author was neglected and their mom was arrested when they were six, leading to their adoption. Now the mom is trying to reconnect after years of separation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the author's actions. The mom had a history of drug abuse and neglect, which is a big deal. The author was in foster care and adopted, so there's a lot of trauma there. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18, and when she did, she admitted to being on crack during pregnancy. That's really heavy.\n\nThe author feels disconnected because they never really knew their mom and she gave them unclear info about their background. They're not returning her messages because they can't find it in themselves to love her. It's about emotional closure and moving on from past trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is clean, found religion, and is trying to be part of their life. But the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact. The key here is whether not responding is justified. The author isn't being cruel, just not engaging. They have valid reasons rooted in past harm and lack of connection. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a history of abandonment and neglect, and it's understandable they need time and distance. The mom's attempts might be genuine, but the author's emotional response is valid given their experiences. It's not about being a jerk, but about personal boundaries and healing.\n"
