My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to her leaving when the author was six. The author was placed in foster care and later adopted. After turning 18, the mom reached out, but there was a lot of unresolved trauma and unanswered questions. The author hasn't responded to her messages, and the mom keeps expressing love and regret. The author feels conflicted but hasn't returned any affection.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's mom has a troubled past that directly impacted the author's life. The author's feelings of resentment and inability to connect are understandable given the circumstances. The key factors here are the history of neglect, the lack of contact for years, and the author's emotional response to the sudden attempts at reconciliation. The author isn't ignoring the messages out of spite, but due to deep-seated issues and unresolved trauma. \n\nThe question is whether this makes the author in the wrong. If we consider that the author has valid reasons stemming from past harm, then they aren't necessarily in the wrong for not engaging. The mother's actions in the past were significant and harmful, and the author's current emotional state is a result of that. However, some might argue that cutting off contact entirely without any communication could be seen as harsh, but given the context, it's more about the author's need to protect their own emotional well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (No), because the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their mental health and not being able to reconcile with someone who caused them significant harm, even if the mother is now trying to make amends. The author's right to set boundaries is important here.\n"
