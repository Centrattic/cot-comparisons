My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're at fault for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's backstory is important. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to them being put in a foster home and eventually adopted. Then, after 18, the mom reconnected. The author had a lot of questions about their identity and background, but the mom couldn't provide answers. The author hasn't spoken to her since that initial contact and now the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author isn't responding, even though the mom sends messages expressing love and encouragement.\n\nThe author feels that the mom is a stranger. They were forced apart by legal issues, and the mom didn't know the author's biological father or their nationality. The author's adoptive parents raised them, and they have a good relationship with them. The mom's past actions caused significant trauma, and now she's trying to make amends, but the author is struggling to forgive or accept her.\n\nNow, considering the options: Is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't ignoring her out of spite. They've been through a lot, and the mom's absence and subsequent inability to provide the information the author needed has caused emotional harm. The author is not obligated to respond or show love if they don't feel it. The mom did abandon them and struggled with addiction, which can impact a person's ability to be a present parent. The author's decision to not engage could be a way to protect their emotional well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom has changed, is clean, and is trying to reconnect. Some might argue that the author could at least acknowledge her messages, even if they don't reciprocate feelings. But given the history, it's also understandable that the author might not have the capacity to reconnect. The author isn't being cruel; they're not responding because of their own emotional barriers. So, it's not necessarily a matter of right or wrong, but more about the author's right to set boundaries based on their experiences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
