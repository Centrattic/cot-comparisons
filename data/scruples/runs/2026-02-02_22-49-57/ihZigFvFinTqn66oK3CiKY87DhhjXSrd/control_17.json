My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was taken from their mom when they were 6 due to her being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were in a foster home and then adopted by a loving family. Their mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, she apologized and mentioned using crack cocaine during pregnancy, but the author felt she didn't know their father or even their nationality. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and missing them, but the author doesn't respond and is conflicted about whether they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment and the mom's past actions. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in deep emotional trauma and a lack of trust. They see her as a stranger despite the biological connection. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the author isn't in a place to accept that. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to consider empathy, the context of the situation, and typical social norms. \n\nIn many cases, people who have been neglected or abandoned might struggle to reconnect, especially when there's a history of abuse. The author's feelings are valid because they've been hurt and left in the dark for so long. They might not have the capacity to forgive or show love right away. It's about healing and personal boundaries. The mom's attempts are good, but the author isn't obligated to respond if they're not ready. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and deserves a response. But given the traumatic past, it's more about the author's right to protect their emotional well-being. They aren't being inconsiderate; they're dealing with deep-seated issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a result of their difficult experiences and the need to establish boundaries. It's not about being an asshole but about coping with a complex history.\n"
