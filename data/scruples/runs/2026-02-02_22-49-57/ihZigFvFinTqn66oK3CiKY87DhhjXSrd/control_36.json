My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for four years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a very difficult childhood. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. At 18, the mother re-entered their life via Facebook but couldn't provide much information about the author's father or background. The mother is now clean and part of a church, but the author hasn't spoken to her since that initial contact. The author feels conflicted, receiving messages from the mother but not responding, and is unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions, the author's trauma, and the current lack of communication. The author isn't ignoring the mother in a malicious way but is processing their feelings and past. The mother, while remorseful, contributed to the separation and has limited the author's knowledge about their origins.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is obligated to respond positively to the mother's messages. The author hasn't cut off communication entirely but hasn't engaged meaningfully for four years. The mother's messages are about love and encouragement, but the author hasn't been able to reciprocate due to unresolved feelings.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the author's hesitation is understandable given the trauma. They might need time to build trust. The mother's actions in the past have created a situation where the author feels disconnected. The author's decision to not respond isn't out of cruelty but a complex emotional response to their history.\n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring a parent's attempts at communication could be seen as neglectful. But considering the context, the author's actions are more about self-protection and dealing with past wounds rather than being inconsiderate. The author hasn't shut down communication entirely, just hasn't engaged, which might be necessary for their emotional health.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The justification is based on the traumatic background and the author's need to process emotions without pressure to reciprocate immediately. The situation isn't a simple case of ignoring someone but a complex interplay of past trauma and current emotional barriers.\n"
