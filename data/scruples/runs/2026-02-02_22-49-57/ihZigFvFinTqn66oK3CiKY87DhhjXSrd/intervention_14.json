My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts. The situation is complicated. The mom had a history of drug abuse and was arrested for child neglect when the author was 6. The author was then placed in foster care and adopted. Now, the mom has reached out after 18, but the author hasn't responded, even though she sends messages expressing love and regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's actions in the past were severe\u2014arrest for neglect and drug use, leading to the child being removed. The author was in foster care and adopted, which probably affected their relationship. The author's lack of response could be due to unresolved trauma, anger, or not feeling a connection anymore.\n\nThe author's perspective is important. They mention feeling like the mom is a stranger now. They might be struggling with trust or the pain of abandonment. The mom's outreach is genuine, but the author isn't ready to reconnect. Is it fair to blame someone for not responding to someone who caused them harm, especially in a situation where they were legally separated for so long?\n\nAlso, the author has valid reasons for not feeling love or wanting to reconnect. They might be protecting themselves from further hurt. The fact that they acknowledge the mom's efforts but can't reciprocate shows some emotional complexity. They might not be intentionally ignoring the mom out of spite, but rather dealing with their own emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and deserves a chance to rebuild the relationship. But in this case, the author's experience of being neglected and abandoned is significant. The decision to not engage isn't a simple choice\u2014it's influenced by deep past trauma.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have every right to set boundaries and prioritize their emotional well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
