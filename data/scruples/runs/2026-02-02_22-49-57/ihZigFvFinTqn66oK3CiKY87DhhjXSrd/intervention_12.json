My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author's mom had serious issues\u2014arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6. The author was placed in a foster home and adopted. The mother couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out via Facebook, but the author found out that the mother didn't even know who their father was. The mother was using crack during pregnancy, which adds to the hurt. Since then, the author hasn't spoken to her, even though the mother keeps sending messages expressing love and regret.\n\nThe author is ignoring these messages for four years and wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nHmm. From what I see, the author's situation is pretty complicated. The mother's actions were harmful and legally problematic, leading to the author's placement in foster care. The mother's absence for so long and the lack of information about the author's origins could cause a lot of emotional trauma. The author's decision not to engage might stem from unresolved feelings of betrayal, anger, or a need to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nThe mother, while expressing remorse and being clean now, might not realize the depth of the damage done. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. They have the right to decide how and when to reconnect, if at all. Not responding doesn't necessarily mean being unkind; it could be a self-protective measure.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to rebuild the relationship and deserves a chance. But considering the mother's past actions and the author's valid emotional response, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic situation, and their emotional distance is a reasonable reaction. The answer should be B.\n"
