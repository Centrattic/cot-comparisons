My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. When they did reconnect through Facebook, the author had many unanswered questions about their identity and background. The mother admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father or nationality. Now, the mother sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond, feeling that the mother is a stranger.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the author has a valid reason to not engage. The mother's past actions led to the author being separated from her, which is significant. The author's lack of response could stem from justified anger, hurt, and the need for emotional boundaries. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be sincere, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate immediately or at all, especially given the history. \n\nIs the author being cold-hearted or is it a self-protective measure? The author might be processing trauma and not ready to rebuild the relationship. Not responding doesn't necessarily make them an asshole; it's about their right to set boundaries. The mother's actions in the past don't negate her current efforts, but the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
