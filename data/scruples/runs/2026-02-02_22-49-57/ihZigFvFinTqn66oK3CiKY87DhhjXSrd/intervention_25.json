My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author was neglected and their mom was arrested for drug abuse when they were 6. They were in foster care and adopted, so they have a different family now. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect through Facebook, but the author found out that their mom didn't know their real father and had used drugs during pregnancy. This probably caused a lot of emotional trauma. The author hasn't spoken to her since and just ignores her messages, even though the mom is clean now and expresses remorse.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants another perspective. So, the key points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the emotional impact of reconnecting and then discovering more negative information, and the author's decision to cut off contact. \n\nOn one hand, the mom is reaching out and saying she's sorry, trying to be part of the author's life. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not trusting her. They were separated due to her actions, and the truth about their upbringing might have reopened old wounds. The author might be protecting their emotional well-being by not responding. \n\nI should consider if the author has a duty to respond, but given the context, it's a personal choice. People have different ways of dealing with such situations. The mom's remorse is real, but the author's feelings of being a stranger to her and the trauma from the past could be legitimate reasons for not engaging. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their healing and setting boundaries after such a painful history. They were a child in a dangerous situation and now are deciding how to handle a reconnection. It's not about being a bad person, but about personal boundaries and emotional safety.\n"
