My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me break this down. First, the background: the mother was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and later adopted. The mother couldn't contact them until they were 18, and when she did, she revealed some painful truths about their past. Now, the author doesn't respond to her messages, even though she sends loving texts.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that their mom is a stranger to them, despite her expressing remorse and sending messages. The key points here are the history of neglect and drug abuse, the forced separation, and the sudden contact after many years. The author has valid emotional reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They might feel betrayed, hurt, or confused. It's been four years since they last spoke, and the mother's actions in the past have caused significant trauma. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not reciprocating love. Well, the mother's actions were legally problematic and harmful. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're dealing with unresolved trauma. Not responding isn't necessarily a sign of being a bad person; it's a personal choice based on their experiences. The mother's attempts to reconnect are good, but the author isn't obligated to accept them immediately or at all. \n\nAlso, the author's adoptive parents are part of their life, and they have a positive relationship with them. The author might be prioritizing their well-being and current family ties. It's important to consider the context of long-term neglect and how that affects someone's ability to form trust. The mother had a long absence, and resuming contact after such a gap isn't straightforward. The author's feelings of being a stranger could be justified given the lack of a consistent relationship over the years.\n\nI should also think about cultural or societal expectations. In some cultures, maintaining family ties is crucial, but in this case, the mother's absence was enforced by legal means, which is different from someone choosing to leave. The author's emotional response is a reaction to years of silence and the sudden, painful revelation about their past. They might need time to process, and it's okay not to respond right away or at all. \n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here, but the author's actions are understandable. They're not being unkind; they're protecting their emotional space. So the answer would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because their response is influenced by past trauma and the right to decide their boundaries.\n"
