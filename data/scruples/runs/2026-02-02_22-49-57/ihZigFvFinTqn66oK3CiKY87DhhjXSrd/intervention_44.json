My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation involves a complicated background with the mother having been arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was in foster care and later adopted. After turning 18, the mother reconnected, but the author has been ignoring her texts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and psychological impact on the author. The mother's absence and the reasons behind it (arrest, drug use) could have caused significant trauma. The author's decision to distance themselves might be a self-protective measure, especially if they haven't built a relationship with their mother since reconnection. \n\nThe mother is reaching out with love and apology, but the author feels conflicted. They mention not knowing who their mother is anymore, which suggests a lack of genuine connection. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. Not responding isn't necessarily a sign of not loving her, but a reflection of unresolved issues and the need for personal space.\n\nAlso, the mother's past actions and the author's adoption into a new family might mean that the author's current identity isn't tied to the biological mother. The author might still be processing their identity and the mother's role in their life. It's not about being wrong to not reciprocate love but about healing and personal boundaries.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. While it's common to feel pressure to forgive or reconnect, the author's emotional well-being is crucial. The answer should acknowledge that healing takes time and that the author isn't obligated to respond if it's harmful for them.\n\nSo, based on the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in their past experiences and ongoing emotional struggles. The answer should be B (No).\n"
