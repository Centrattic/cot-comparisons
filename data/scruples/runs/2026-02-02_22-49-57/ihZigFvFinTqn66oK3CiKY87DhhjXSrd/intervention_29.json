My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for four years. The author has a complicated history with their mother, including the mother's arrest for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. After turning 18, the mother reached out, but the author found out the mother couldn't provide answers about their father or heritage and that she was on drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mother sends loving messages, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mother had a significant role in their early life, but it was traumatic. The neglect, drug use, and inability to provide basic information about the author's heritage could contribute to feelings of anger, resentment, or disconnection. The author might be dealing with emotional wounds from being separated and not knowing their biological background, which their mother couldn't resolve. \n\nThe mother's actions in the past were harmful, and even though she's clean now and wants to reconnect, the author's lack of response isn't necessarily a refusal to love but a result of deep-seated issues. People have different ways of processing trauma. The author might not feel ready to engage in a relationship that could be painful or might not trust their mother's sincerity. \n\nHowever, some might argue that even with past issues, the mother is reaching out in a positive way, and ignoring her could be seen as cutting her off without effort to reconcile. But given the circumstances, the author's feelings are valid. They were neglected, then left in the dark, and now are struggling with identity issues. The mother's current efforts might not be enough to overcome years of pain and unanswered questions.\n\nIn \"AITA\" scenarios, the key is whether the person is being unreasonable. The author isn't doing anything harmful beyond not responding. The mother initiated contact after years of separation, but the emotional debt is on her side. The author's response (or lack thereof) is a personal choice based on their justified hurt. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
