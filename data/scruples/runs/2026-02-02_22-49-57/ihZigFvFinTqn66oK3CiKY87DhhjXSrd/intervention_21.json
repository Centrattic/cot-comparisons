My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6. The author was put in foster care and adopted. After 18, the mom reconnected but didn't have answers to the author's questions. Now she sends texts, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother, leading to separation and adoption. The mom's actions caused significant harm. The author isn't returning affection because they feel disconnected, seeing the mother as a stranger. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mom is trying to reconnect and express love, but the author has valid reasons for not responding. They haven't caused harm by ignoring the messages; they're protecting their own emotional well-being. The mother's actions in the past were the real issue here. The author isn't obligated to reciprocate love if they feel it's not genuine or if they haven't reconciled the past. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They're dealing with deep-seated issues from their past. The mom's actions were more harmful, and the author's choice to not engage is a personal one, not a wrong one.\n"
