My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: The person's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The child was put in foster care and later adopted by a new family. The mom was legally barred from contacting the child until they turned 18. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect via Facebook. The child had a lot of questions about their identity, but the mom couldn't provide answers. She apologized and expressed regret, but the child hasn't spoken to her since, ignoring her messages.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past drug use, the child being in foster care, the legal separation, and the emotional impact on the child. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the author feels disconnected and hurt.\n\nI need to consider if ignoring someone who is trying to reconnect is wrong, especially in the context of past trauma. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author is still processing that. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with the aftermath of abuse and neglect. However, some might argue that even with a difficult past, acknowledging the mother's efforts could be important. But given the context, the author's decision not to respond seems justified as a protective measure for their own emotional well-being. They're not ignoring the mother out of spite but because they haven't reconciled the pain from the past. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
