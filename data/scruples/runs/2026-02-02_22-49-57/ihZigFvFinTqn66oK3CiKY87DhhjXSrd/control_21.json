My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation is complex. The author's mother was involved in serious issues like child neglect and drug abuse when the author was a child, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mother was legally barred from contacting the author until they turned 18. When she did reach out, the author had many questions but felt hurt by the mother's lack of knowledge about their father and background. The mother now sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond and is struggling with whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and emotional context here. The author's mother had a significant role in their early life, albeit problematic. The author has the right to feel hurt and to set boundaries, especially given the history of neglect and the impact on their childhood. The mother's actions in the past caused trauma, and the author's current lack of response could be a way of coping with that trauma. The mother has since changed her life, but the author isn't obligated to accept or reciprocate her love. \n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off a parent, even a problematic one, could be seen as harsh. But considering the context of abuse and neglect, the author's choice to distance themselves isn't necessarily wrong. The key points are the mother's past actions, the legal separation, the author's emotional response, and the fact that the author is not the one who initiated harm. The mother's current outreach is well-intentioned, but the author's decision to not respond is a personal boundary. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often judge based on surface actions without understanding the full context. The author isn't being malicious; they're dealing with deep-seated issues. Therefore, the answer is more likely B (Not the asshole) because the author's actions stem from valid emotional trauma and the right to establish personal boundaries.\n"
