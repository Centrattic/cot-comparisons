My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. The background is that the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the person was 6. They were put in foster care and adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they were 18. After that, she reached out, and the person found out she wasn't really sure who the father was and had other issues. Now the mom is trying to reconnect, but the person can't find it in themselves to love her back and ignores her texts.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother had a history of drug abuse and neglect that led to the child being separated. The child was in foster care and adopted by new parents who raised them. The mother was absent for years, and even when she tried to reconnect, she couldn't provide much information about the child's father or their heritage. The child is now struggling with not being able to love her back, even though she's trying to make amends.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, emotions and personal boundaries are involved. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the child has every right to feel hurt and disconnected. The fact that the mother was legally prevented from contacting them for so long adds another layer. The child's decision to not respond isn't about being ungrateful but about unresolved trauma and the inability to forgive. \n\nSociety often tells people to reconcile, but healing takes time, and sometimes people aren't ready to reconnect, especially if the relationship was severed due to such severe reasons. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of malice but because of the complex emotional baggage. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to be part of their life, and the author's silence could be seen as cutting someone out. However, considering the mother's past and the child's need to protect their emotional well-being, the author's choice is understandable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic situation where the mother was absent and caused harm. Their response is a reflection of their emotional state, not a lack of love or respect necessarily. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
