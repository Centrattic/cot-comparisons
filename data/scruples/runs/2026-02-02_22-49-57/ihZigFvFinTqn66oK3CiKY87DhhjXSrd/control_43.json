My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't returned any love or messages since recontacting her after being 18. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to her leaving and not being allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. The author was adopted and had a stable upbringing with their adoptive parents. When they turned 18, the mom reached out, but the author found out she couldn't provide answers about their father or nationality. The mom is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't reciprocate love.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to set boundaries, especially given the traumatic history. The mom's past actions were harmful, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond. The author's decision to not engage could be seen as self-protection rather than being a jerk. The mom initiating contact after 18 is a new chapter, but the author's feelings are valid given their history. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to unresolved issues and emotional distance. So, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
