My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the person's mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the child was 6. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. After turning 18, the child tried to reconnect but found out the mom didn't even know who their father was or their nationality. The mom now texts often with love messages, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nI need to consider the emotional and psychological impact here. The mother abandoned them due to her actions, which led to the child being in foster care and adopted. The child probably has a lot of unresolved trauma and anger. The mom's sudden reentry after so many years, even with good intentions, might be triggering. The fact that the child didn't know their father and the mom's drug use during pregnancy adds to the complexity.\n\nThe person isn't ignoring out of malice but because they can't forgive or connect after all that. The article mentions they feel the mother is a stranger. It's about their right to set boundaries after being hurt. Also, the mother's actions were illegal and harmful, which makes the situation not as simple as just not responding to texts.\n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). From a moral standpoint, can someone be wrong for not responding to someone who caused them significant harm and was absent for most of their life? The person's decision to not engage is about protecting their own mental health. The mother's texts might be perceived as insincere or an intrusion after so much absence.\n\nI think the answer is B. The person isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons rooted in past trauma and the mother's long-term absence and harmful actions. They have the right to set boundaries and not engage if they aren't ready.\n"
