My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, there's the history of the mother being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mother was legally barred from contacting them until age 18. When she did reach out after 18, the child had a lot of questions about their identity and heritage, but the mother couldn't provide answers. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the child doesn't respond, feeling it's hard to love someone who was absent and caused so much pain.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions and the child's emotional response. The mother's behavior was harmful, and she was legally separated from her child. The child's lack of response could be seen as justified given the trauma and the lack of a current relationship. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the child is struggling with that. \n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong for not responding. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From a moral standpoint, the child isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel ready. The mother's actions in the past don't automatically make the child wrong for not engaging now. The child's feelings are valid, especially considering the history. The mother's outreach is genuine, but the child's right to set boundaries is important. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
