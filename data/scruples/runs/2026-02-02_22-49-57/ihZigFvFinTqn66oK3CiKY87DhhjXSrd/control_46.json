My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages. The situation is complicated. The person had a really tough childhood because their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were in foster care and then adopted. When they turned 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but she didn't have the answers they needed. Now she sends messages but the person doesn't respond. The mom is clean and apologetic, but the person feels she's a stranger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person's mom caused significant harm and was absent for years. The child was taken away, which is a major trauma. The mom's actions led to the child being in foster care and then adopted by a new family. The person now feels disconnected and doesn't know how to reconcile that. The mom is reaching out, but the person is struggling with whether they should respond.\n\nLegally, the mom couldn't contact them until 18, which adds another layer. The person might feel that the mom lost the right to be a parent by her actions. The trauma of being neglected and then having the mom try to reconnect without providing closure or answers could make it hard for the person to respond. It's understandable that they don't want to engage, especially if they're still healing from past wounds.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if the mom made mistakes, cutting her out completely could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, the person's feelings are valid. They have the right to set boundaries. The mom's apologies might not be enough to bridge the gap caused by years of absence and neglect. The person isn't obligated to respond to messages that don't feel genuine or if they're not ready to reconcile.\n\nAlso, the person is dealing with their identity issues, which the mom hasn't helped with. The lack of answers about their father and nationality adds to their distress. The mom's inability to provide those answers might have contributed to the person's decision to distance themselves. The person is prioritizing their emotional well-being by not engaging, which is a reasonable choice.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the history of abuse, neglect, and the person's right to protect their own emotional health, the author is not in the wrong for not responding. They're making a choice based on their experiences and current feelings. So the answer should be B.\n"
