My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The mom lives in Nevada, and the author is on the West Coast. The mom sends messages expressing love, birthday wishes, encouragement, but the author never responds. \n\nThe backstory is that when the author was 6, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading the author to be placed in foster care and eventually adopted by a different family. The mom was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. After that, the author tried to reconnect, but the mom didn't have answers about their father or nationality. The author felt a heart sink because the mom didn't know their father. The mom apologized and said she's clean and found faith, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't love her back. Now, the author isn't responding to her messages.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and emotional aspects. The mom was legally prevented from contacting the author until 18, so there's a long gap where the author had no relationship with her. When she reconnected, the author had unanswered questions and now feels disconnected. The author's adoptive parents are important here as well, and the author's current emotional state. \n\nThe mom is trying to reach out, but the author hasn't responded. The key here is whether the author is being cruel by not responding. The author's reasoning is that they can't love her back because she's a stranger. So, is ignoring her texts cruel, or is it a valid response to their history?\n\nI need to think about boundaries and healing. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic experience. The mom's actions in the past caused the author to be separated and placed in foster care. Even though the mom is trying to reconnect, the author might need time and validation. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expressing remorse and trying to rebuild a relationship. Not responding could be seen as cutting her off, but given the author's history, it's understandable. The author might feel that they can't forgive her yet. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not responding? I think not. The author has valid reasons for not engaging, given the history. The mom's actions caused significant harm, and the author is within their rights to prioritize their emotional well-being. It's about healing and not being obligated to reciprocate love when it's not genuine. So, the answer would be B.\n"
