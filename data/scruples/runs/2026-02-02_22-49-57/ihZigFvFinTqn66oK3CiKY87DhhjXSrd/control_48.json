My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The mother was involved in child neglect and drug abuse when the author was young. The author was placed in foster care and adopted. Now, after turning 18, the mother tries to reconnect, but the author isn't able to respond emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were legally significant and caused the author to be separated from her. The author's feelings of anger, confusion, and lack of trust are valid. The mother, now clean and trying to reconnect, is doing the right thing, but the author isn't ready to engage. The author's decision not to respond isn't about being cruel but about emotional readiness. They might feel that the mother wasn't present in their life and now expects love, which is difficult to accept. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some would argue that the mother is making amends and deserves a chance. However, the author has the right to set boundaries. They're not obligated to reciprocate love if they haven't resolved their feelings. The key point is that the author isn't ignoring the texts out of spite but because of unresolved trauma. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their emotional well-being and the situation is complex with valid reasons for not responding.\n"
