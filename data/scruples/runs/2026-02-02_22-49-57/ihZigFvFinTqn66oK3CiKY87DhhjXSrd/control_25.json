My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation involves a complicated background. So, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. There's a Native-American Ex-Marine father and an African American mother now, whom the author loves.\n\nAfter turning 18, the mother reconnected via Facebook. The author had a lot of questions, but the mother couldn't provide answers, especially about the father's identity and nationality. She apologized and mentioned her past drug use, including during pregnancy. Now, the mother sends love messages, but the author doesn't respond. They feel the mother is a stranger and can't love her back. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She was arrested for serious issues and was away for years, which is a significant abandonment. The author was in foster care and adoption, which probably affected their emotional connection. Now the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author is hurt and hasn't forgiven her. The author's silence might be seen as cutting off someone who is trying to make amends, but given the history, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe mother's apologies and expressions of love are there, but the author hasn't had time to process the past. The author might feel betrayed or neglected, so not responding is a way to protect themselves. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother is seeking a relationship and deserves a response, even if it's not a full reconciliation yet. But the fact that the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact and hasn't responded to messages is a key point. \n\nThe mother was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until 18, which might have been part of the legal consequences. However, the author's current non-response is a choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not engaging. Emotional trauma and broken trust can take time to heal, and the author hasn't even met their biological mother. It's a complex situation where both parties have their own valid perspectives. \n\nThe author's reasons for not responding (not knowing who she is, unresolved feelings) might be valid. They might be dealing with anger or hurt, and it's okay to set boundaries. However, people might view not responding as unkind, especially since the mother is expressing remorse. But given the history, the author's silence could be a coping mechanism. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have legitimate emotional reasons and the situation is traumatic.\n"
