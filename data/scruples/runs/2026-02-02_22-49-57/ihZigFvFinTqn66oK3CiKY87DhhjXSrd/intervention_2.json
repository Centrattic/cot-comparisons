My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The child was adopted and had a good relationship with their adoptive parents. When the mother reconnected after 18, the author wanted to know their background but felt let down by the mother's lack of answers. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author doesn't feel they can return love because they see her as a stranger.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions and the trauma involved. The author's decision to not respond is rooted in their history of abandonment and the mother's failure to provide the information they needed. The mother's current efforts might be genuine, but the author hasn't received the closure or understanding they needed. \n\nIt's important to consider the emotional impact of the mother's actions. The author hasn't been unkind; they're just not engaging because of valid reasons. They're not ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved pain. The mother's attempts to reconnect are good, but the author's decision not to reciprocate isn't necessarily wrong given their history. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their actions, and healing from such a situation takes time. The mother's perspective is valid, but the author's right to set boundaries is also important.\n"
