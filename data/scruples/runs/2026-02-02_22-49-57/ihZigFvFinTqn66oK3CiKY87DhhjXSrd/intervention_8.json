My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo the author hasn't been in contact with their mom since they were 6 until she reached out when the author turned 18. The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being in foster care and then adopted. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels they can't love her back because she's a stranger. The author ignores her messages for four years.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the context. The mom had a significant role in the author's life being absent for so long, legal issues, and substance abuse. The author was adopted by a different family, which probably provided stability. The mom's return after 18 years is a big deal, but the author hasn't had time to process this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's understandable that they're hurt and haven't built a relationship with their mom. They might feel confused or resentful. Not responding to messages doesn't necessarily make them wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially given the past trauma.\n\nThe mom, while trying to reconnect, might not realize the depth of the emotional barriers. The author's decision to not engage could be a coping mechanism. It's important to consider the power dynamics here. The author isn't actively hurting their mom by not responding; it's more of an emotional distance they've chosen.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother's attempts to reconcile deserve a response, even if it's not affectionate. But the author's right to emotional autonomy is significant here. They've been through a lot, and healing takes time. Not responding isn't a malicious act; it's a personal choice based on their history.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with complex emotions and past trauma. The answer should reflect that understanding.\n"
