My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. The mother had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to the child being placed in foster care and adopted. The mother couldn't contact the child until they turned 18.\n\nSo, the author is now in their 20s and their mom has been reaching out, expressing love and missing them. But the author hasn't responded, feeling that the mother is a stranger. The key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions leading to the child's separation, and the current emotional distance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. Well, considering the mother's past, she did commit serious offenses that directly affected the child's life. The child was in foster care, which is a traumatic experience. The mother's absence wasn't just a choice; it was legally enforced because of her actions. Now, even though she's trying to reconnect, the author isn't ready to forgive or reconnect. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to respond. They have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. The mother's actions were harmful, and the author's emotional response is valid. People have different healing processes. Just because someone wants reconciliation doesn't mean the hurt party must reciprocate immediately or at all. \n\nThe mother's current behavior might be positive, like being clean and seeking faith, but that doesn't erase past actions. The author hasn't chosen to cut her off completely; they're just not engaging right now. There's no indication they're being cruel, just emotionally distant. \n\nSo, given all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They've been through a lot, and their decision to not respond is a personal choice based on their trauma and need for space. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
