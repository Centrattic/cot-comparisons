My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a really tough childhood. His mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use when he was 6. He was put in foster care and then adopted. He didn't see his mom until he was 18. When she contacted him after being away for so long, he had a lot of questions but felt let down because she couldn't provide answers. Now, she sends him messages expressing love and support, but he doesn't respond. He's wondering if he's the asshole for not responding.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the forced separation, the emotional trauma, and the current lack of a relationship. The mom is clean now and has a good intention, but the author hasn't built trust with her yet. He feels disconnected and sees her as a stranger. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider his emotional state and past experiences. He's not in a position where he can just \"get over\" the past. His decision not to respond is a self-protective measure. The mom, while well-meaning, doesn't have the same history with him as a parent; their relationship was severed by legal and personal issues. \n\nPeople might argue that he should try to reconnect, but that's different from saying he's in the wrong for not responding. Healing takes time, especially after such trauma. The author isn't ignoring her out of malice but because of unresolved pain and distrust. So, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
