My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author hasn't responded to their mother's texts for four years. The mother sends messages expressing love and well-wishes, but the author doesn't respond. The backstory involves the mother's past issues with drug abuse, neglect, and the author being in foster care and adopted. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested when the author was six for neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and later adopted. The mother was legally barred from contact until the author turned 18. After that, she reached out, but the author found out the mother didn't know their father or nationality, and admitted to drug use during pregnancy. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels unable to love her back.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. The key here is the context of their history. The author has a traumatic background with the mother, and the mother's actions led to their separation. The author's emotional distance could be a result of trauma and a lack of a built relationship. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't formed a bond with her yet. \n\nIn determining if the author is in the wrong, it's important to consider intent and circumstances. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of malice but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of a meaningful relationship. The mother's messages, while well-intentioned, might be triggering or feel insincere given her past. The author's adoption into a loving family might also play a role in their current emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not responding to a parent's messages, even if distant, could be seen as dismissive. However, given the history, the author's response (or lack thereof) is a personal boundary they've set for their own emotional well-being. It's a complex situation where the author's feelings are valid given their experiences. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their actions stem from a place of trauma and a need to set boundaries, not from a desire to hurt their mother. The \"wrong\" here isn't clear-cut, but the author's perspective is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), they are not in the wrong."
