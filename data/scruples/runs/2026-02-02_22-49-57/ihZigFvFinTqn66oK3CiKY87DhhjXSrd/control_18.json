My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for not responding to their mother's messages of love and well-wishes. The backstory is that the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, which included using crack cocaine during pregnancy. The author was then placed in a foster home and adopted by a new family. There was a legal restriction that prevented the mother from contacting the author until they turned 18. After that, the mother reached out via Facebook, and the author had emotional conversations with her, learning that the mother didn't know the author's father or nationality, and that she was sorry for her past actions. Now, the mother sends texts expressing her love and missing the author, but the author hasn't responded, leading to the question of whether they are wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The mother abandoned the author when they were very young due to her own actions, which were serious (drug abuse, neglect). The author was then raised by adoptive parents, whom they love. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until 18, which is a significant age gap. When contact was re-established, the author tried to learn about their biological background, but it seems the mother's answers were not helpful or perhaps even hurtful, given the author's statement that their heart sank. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nThe author is not responding to the mother's messages. The mother is clean, found religion, and expresses regret. The author's main argument is that they can't reciprocate love because they don't know who this person is. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect some level of communication when someone is trying to reconnect, especially after expressing regret. However, the author's situation is complicated by the history of abandonment and neglect. The mother's actions when the author was a child caused significant harm, and the author was effectively cut off for 12 years. When the mother finally contacted them, the information revealed might have been painful or confusing, making it hard to build a relationship.\n\nThe author might be dealing with complex emotions\u2014anger, betrayal, confusion about identity, and a lack of trust. It's important to acknowledge that healing from such a history takes time. Not responding could be a protective measure for the author, allowing them to process their feelings without immediate pressure. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and that the author's silence could be hurtful, even if there's no obligation to reconcile.\n\nBut the mother initiated contact only after a long period of absence, and the author is within their right to set boundaries. The fact that the author has an adoptive family they love suggests a successful integration into a new life. The mother's current efforts are positive, but the author's trauma and the lack of a real, ongoing relationship since childhood might mean they're not obligated to respond. It's a personal decision, and the author is not in the wrong for choosing to focus on their own emotional well-being and not on their mother's feelings at this time.\n\nI should also consider if there's any expectation of forgiveness or reconciliation. While the mother is remorseful, the author's feelings are valid. They have the right to take time to decide if and how to engage. The mother's attempts to reconnect are commendable, but the author's silence isn't necessarily a transgression. It's about the author's right to self-determination and emotional boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author has the right to set boundaries based on their past experiences and emotional state. The mother's actions caused harm, and the author's decision not to respond is a personal choice that isn't required by any moral obligation here.\n"
