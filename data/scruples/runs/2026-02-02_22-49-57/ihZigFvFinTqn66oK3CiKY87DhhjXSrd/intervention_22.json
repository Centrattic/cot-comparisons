My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to the kid being put in foster care. After turning 18, the mom reconnected, but the kid feels hurt and can't forgive her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's past actions had a significant impact on the child's life. The child was in foster care, separated from their biological parent due to legal issues. The mom was using drugs during pregnancy, which adds to the trauma. Now, after 18, the mom reaches out, but the child is struggling to reconnect because of the past. \n\nThe key points are the mother's history of neglect and drug abuse, the forced separation, and the child's emotional response. The child hasn't ignored the mom entirely; they've just not returned the love messages. They explain their reasons, feeling that the mom is a stranger and can't move past the pain. \n\nIs it wrong to not respond to love messages after such a traumatic history? Maybe the mom is trying to rebuild, but the child's feelings are valid. People have different coping mechanisms. If the child isn't ready to reconnect, it's their right. They might need more time or closure. The fact that they're even considering the question shows some level of conflict, but their reasons are rooted in past trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying and deserves a chance. But given the severity of the mother's past actions and the child's experience, the child's stance makes sense. They\u2019re not ignoring her out of spite but because of unresolved pain. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in their history. The mother's actions affected them deeply, and they're not obligated to forgive or respond immediately. It's about healing and personal boundaries.\n"
