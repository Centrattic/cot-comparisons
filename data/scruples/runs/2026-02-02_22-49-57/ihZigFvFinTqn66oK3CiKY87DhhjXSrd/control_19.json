My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years ago. The backstory is pretty intense. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. Now they're trying to reconnect, but the person can't find it in themselves to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother did abandon them due to her actions, which were serious. The child was removed from her care and placed with adoptive parents who they love. The mother's absence was forced by law, but she also caused harm. When contact was allowed, the mother reached out, but the person feels hurt and disconnected. The mother's reasons for the past are clear, but the person is struggling to reconcile that with their current feelings.\n\nThe person isn't ignoring out of spite but because they're dealing with unresolved trauma and feelings of betrayal. They're not cutting off communication because they're angry now, but because they can't emotionally engage with someone who was absent and caused their early trauma. The mother is now trying to be part of their life, but the person hasn't forgiven her yet. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about emotional healing. The person isn't obligated to respond if they haven't healed. It's their right to set boundaries. The mother's actions in the past have a lasting impact, and healing isn't something that can be rushed. The fact that the person is even considering reconnecting shows they're not entirely closed off, but they need time and space. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the context of their history justifies their hesitation. It's not about being an asshole but about their emotional state and the trauma they've endured. They're not ignoring her to be mean, but because they can't process their feelings yet. The mother's actions in the past make it hard for them to reciprocate love immediately. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong.\n"
