My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts. Let me start by going through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't been in contact with their mom for four years. The mom sends messages saying she loves them, misses them, and sends birthday/Merry Christmas wishes, but the author never responds. The backstory is that when the author was 6, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in a foster home and eventually adopted. The mom couldn't contact the author until they were 18 due to legal reasons. When they did reconnect, the author had many unanswered questions about their identity and family. The mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing who their father is. Now the mom is clean, part of a church, and wants to be in the author's life, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment and neglect, the emotional trauma of not knowing their biological mother for so long, and the author's current emotional state. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to these messages.\n\nI think the main factors to consider are intent and context. The author's decision not to respond is rooted in deep-seated emotional pain and a lack of trust. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, leading to the author being separated from her and having a different family. Now, after reconnecting, the author is struggling with their identity and the mother's past behavior. The author isn't ignoring the messages out of malice but because they can't emotionally reconnect. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reach out, showing regret and wanting to be part of their life. However, the author has every right to set boundaries, especially given the history. It's not about being an asshole but about emotional healing and personal space. The author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel comfortable. The mother's actions in the past made her unavailable and uninvolved for a significant part of the author's life. Now, the author is reclaiming their autonomy in this relationship.\n\nIn situations involving trauma, people often need time and space to process. The author isn't rejecting their mother out of spite; they're protecting themselves from further emotional distress. The mother's outreach is commendable, but the author's right to emotional boundaries is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding to the texts.\n"
