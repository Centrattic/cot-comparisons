My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Their mom had a lot of issues, like drug abuse and neglect, leading to the child being in foster care. The mom was legally prohibited from contacting them until they were 18. When she did reach out, she admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and being unsure about the child's father. The person feels hurt and disconnected, seeing her as a stranger despite her apologies and attempts to reconnect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's past actions were severe\u2014child neglect, drug use, and abandoning the child. The legal consequences were significant. The child was adopted by loving parents, which provided a stable environment. The mother's attempts to reconnect come after years of absence, and while she's clean and apologetic, the child hasn't chosen to reconnect. \n\nEmotionally, the child has valid reasons for not wanting to engage. Trust is broken, and there's a lack of consistent, positive interaction over the years. The mother's actions caused trauma, and it's reasonable for the child to need time, space, or even to cut off contact. The fact that the child is maintaining boundaries might be a healthy response given the history. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and that the child could be more open. However, the decision to ignore messages isn't a trivial matter. It's about healing and personal boundaries. The child isn't obligated to forgive or reconnect. The key here is the mother's history versus the child's current emotional state and needs. The person isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries after years of neglect and abandonment. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the person's actions stem from justified hurt and the need to establish boundaries after years of their mother's absence and harmful behavior.\n"
