My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't responded to their mother's love texts for four years. The background is pretty complicated. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in a foster home and eventually adopted. The mother couldn't contact the author until they turned 18, and after that initial contact, the author hasn't spoken to her again, even though she reaches out with messages of love and regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic childhood, being separated from their biological mother due to her legal issues and substance abuse. They were raised by adoptive parents who they love, which probably helped them grow up okay despite the challenges. Now, the biological mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels conflicted. They mention not being able to find it in themselves to love her back, seeing her as a stranger despite her efforts.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and abuse by the mother, the long separation, and the author's emotional response. The mother is clean and has expressed remorse, but the author is struggling with trust and acceptance. The question is whether the author is at fault for not responding to their mother's messages.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to weigh both sides. The mother is trying to reconnect after a long time and has shown regret. However, the author has valid reasons for their feelings, given the past trauma. It's not necessarily about whether the author is being unkind, but whether they have a right to set boundaries based on their history.\n\nThe author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite but because of deep-seated emotional issues. They might need time or therapy to process their feelings. The mother, while clean and remorseful, might not understand the extent of the emotional damage caused. The author's adoptive parents provided a stable environment, which is a positive aspect in their upbringing.\n\nJudging the author for not responding could overlook the trauma they experienced. People have different ways of coping, and the author might not be in a place to reconcile yet. It's possible they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being over their biological mother's desires. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends, and the author's silence could be seen as cutting her off without giving her a chance, but given the history, that might not be fair.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for not engaging, and their emotional response is understandable given their past. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author's current stance is a result of that trauma. It's not a simple black-and-white situation, but the author's actions are justified in this context.\n"
