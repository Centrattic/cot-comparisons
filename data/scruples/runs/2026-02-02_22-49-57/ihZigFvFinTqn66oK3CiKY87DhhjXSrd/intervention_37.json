My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They have a pretty complicated background. Their mom was arrested when they were six for child neglect and drug abuse, and they were put in foster care. They were adopted by a different family, and then after turning 18, the mom reached out again.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is being unfair by not responding to their mom's messages. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't forgiven her. The author explains that their mom was using crack during pregnancy, didn't know their father, and was absent for most of their life. They feel like a stranger and can't find it in their heart to love her back.\n\nI need to consider the context. The mom did commit serious offenses, leading to the child being taken away. The child was in a different family and now has a different identity. The mom is trying to reach out, but the author is hurt and doesn't want to engage. The author isn't ignoring her without reason. They're dealing with the trauma of abandonment and the mom's drug use. \n\nForgiveness isn't something that can be forced. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially given the mom's history. The mom's actions had real consequences, and the author is dealing with the aftermath. Not responding doesn't make them the asshole; it's a personal choice based on hurt and lack of trust. The mom's attempts to reconnect are appreciated, but the author isn't obligated to reciprocate. \n\nSo I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're dealing with deep-seated issues and have every right to protect their emotional well-being.\n"
