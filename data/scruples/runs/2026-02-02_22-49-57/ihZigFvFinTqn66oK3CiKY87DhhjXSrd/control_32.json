My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The person has a complicated background with their mom being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, they reconnected with their mom, but there's a lot of unresolved issues. The mom is clean now, apologetic, but the person can't return her love.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the person's actions are justified. The mom had a long history of drug abuse, neglect, and left the state, leading to a 12-year separation. The person was in foster care, which is traumatic. The reconnection after 18 was emotional, but the mom couldn't provide answers about their father or nationality. The person is struggling with not being able to love her back, despite her efforts.\n\nThe key factors here are the history of neglect and abuse, the trauma involved, and the person's current struggle to reconcile their feelings. The mom is trying to rebuild the relationship, but the person hasn't forgiven her. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not responding to her texts.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, emotions and past trauma play a significant role. The person isn't rejecting her out of spite but because of deep-seated issues from their childhood. The mom's actions in the past caused harm, and the person is dealing with the aftermath. It's not a simple case of ignoring someone without reason. They have valid reasons for their emotional distance.\n\nAlso, the person isn't cutting her off entirely; they're receiving messages but not responding. The mom is reaching out, but the person hasn't found it in their heart to reciprocate the love yet. That's a personal journey and not something others can judge easily. The person's answer is more about their emotional state than being ungrateful or cruel. So, the answer would be that the person isn't in the wrong because their actions are rooted in past trauma and unresolved feelings, not malice.\n"
