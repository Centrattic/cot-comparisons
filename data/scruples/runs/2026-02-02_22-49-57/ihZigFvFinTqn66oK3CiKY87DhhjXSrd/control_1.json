My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is whether they are at fault for ignoring their mom's texts for four years and not returning her expressions of love.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was in a foster home after their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were adopted by a new family, which they love. At 18, the mom reached out again, and the person had a lot of unanswered questions about their past. The mom admitted she didn't know much about their heritage or fathers because of her own issues. Now she's trying to reconnect, but the person can't bring themselves to love her back and ignores her messages.\n\nSo, the person is conflicted. They feel the mother is a stranger, and the history is complicated with the mother's past actions. The mother is clean now and wants to be part of their life, but the person hasn't forgiven her. The main issue is whether the person is wrong for not responding to the mother's affectionate texts.\n\nI should consider the context. The mother was absent for significant reasons\u2014legal issues forced her to leave, and she had substance abuse problems. However, the person had to endure being separated from their mother and dealt with the trauma of neglect. They were in a different family, which they grew to love. The mother's return after 18 years might be causing emotional conflict, and the person might not be ready to reconnect.\n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, the person isn't obligated to respond positively to someone who caused them pain. The mother's actions had lasting effects, and the person's emotional response is understandable. The fact that they haven't spoken to her since the initial contact suggests they're not hostile but rather emotionally distant. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the mother is trying to mend the relationship, and the person could at least acknowledge her attempts. But given the history, it's not a simple matter. The person's right to set boundaries and protect their emotional well-being is important. They don't have to reciprocate love if they feel it's not genuine or if they haven't healed.\n\nConsidering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their feelings and actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
