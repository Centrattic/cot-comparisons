My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The author had a really rough childhood, with their mom being arrested for neglect and drug abuse. They were put into foster care and then adopted. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels too much emotional distance to reciprocate the love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and substance abuse. That's a significant factor. The author's decision not to respond might stem from deep-seated trust issues or resentment. It's important to note that the author is dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and possibly trauma. \n\nThe mother, while now clean and trying to reconnect, was a major cause of the author's pain. The author's emotional response is understandable given their history. Not responding isn't necessarily a moral failing but a personal boundary. People process such situations differently. Some might try to reconnect, others might not. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite but because they haven't been able to reconcile the past.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and the author's silence could be seen as cruel. But considering the author's background, their actions are more about self-preservation and healing. The question is whether they're at fault for not engaging. Since they're not intentionally harming anyone but prioritizing their own emotional well-being, it's less about being in the wrong and more about personal choice.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with complex emotions and past trauma, and their response is a personal decision based on their experiences.\n"
