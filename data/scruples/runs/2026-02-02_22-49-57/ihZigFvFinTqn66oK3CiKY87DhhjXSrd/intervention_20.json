My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. Let's break down the situation. The user is asking for an opinion on whether they are the asshole (AITA) in this scenario.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was neglected by their mother when they were very young, leading to them being put in a foster home and eventually adopted by a new family. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which forced her to leave the state and couldn't contact the child until they turned 18. After turning 18, the author reached out via Facebook, had an emotional conversation where the mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. Now, the mother sends love messages, but the author doesn't respond and feels conflicted about returning love because they see her as a stranger.\n\nThe author's main conflict is emotional. They have a complicated relationship with their biological mother who was absent and harmful in their early life. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the author feels unable to reciprocate love because of the past trauma. The question is whether not responding to her messages for four years makes the author the asshole.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author's decision not to respond seems to stem from valid emotional reasons. The mother's absence and the circumstances of her leaving were traumatic. The author has been raised by a loving adoptive family, which probably provided a stable environment. The author might not feel obligated to connect with someone who abandoned them, even if the mother is now trying to make amends. It's important to acknowledge that healing from such a situation takes time, and the author's feelings are legitimate. The mother's attempts to reconnect are positive, but the author's right to set boundaries and not engage is also valid. They are not obligated to forgive or respond immediately, especially if it's causing them distress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding.\n"
