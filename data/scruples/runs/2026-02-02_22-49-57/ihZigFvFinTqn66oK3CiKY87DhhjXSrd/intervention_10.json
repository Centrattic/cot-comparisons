My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to consider all the aspects.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was placed in foster care and later adopted by a new family. There's a history of neglect and the mother wasn't allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. That's a significant point. The mother had a lot of children with different partners, and the author didn't know much about their father or nationality.\n\nAfter turning 18, the author reached out, and the mother admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. The mother is now clean, has found religion, and wants to reconnect. But the author feels conflicted. They don't return the mother's texts or express love, considering her a stranger. The author is struggling with forgiveness and acceptance.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. The mother's past actions were severe\u2014child neglect, drug use during pregnancy, abandoning the child. The author has been in foster care and adopted, which might affect their ability to trust or reconnect. The mother is now trying to make amends, but the author hasn't forgiven her yet.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries, especially after trauma. The author's feelings are valid; they might need time to process and decide if they want to engage. The mother's actions caused lasting harm, and forgiveness isn't a requirement. The author isn't obligated to respond to messages if they're not ready. However, the mother is trying to reach out, which is a positive step, but the author's decision to not reciprocate isn't necessarily wrong. They might be prioritizing their emotional well-being.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might judge the author for not being more open, but it's important to consider the complexity of their background. The author has been through a lot and might still be healing. The question is more about personal boundaries versus societal norms. Since the author hasn't done anything illegal or morally wrong (they're just not responding to messages), they aren't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of serious parental neglect and may not have the capacity to forgive yet. The answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
