My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they haven't responded to their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages expressing love, birthday wishes, etc., but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, the backstory is important. The author's mom had a history of drug abuse, neglect, and was arrested. The author was placed in foster care and adopted. They didn't have contact with their mom until they turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mom admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. The author feels hurt and disconnected because their mom can't provide answers and they see her as a stranger now.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to her messages, not out of malice, but because they can't find it in themselves to love her back. They feel the mom is a stranger, even though she calls herself their mom. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a valid reason. The mom's past actions had a significant impact on the author's life. The author's decision could stem from unresolved trauma, anger, or the inability to forgive. The mom is now trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't been able to move past the past. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but because of emotional barriers.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being unkind or ungracious not to respond, especially to family. However, given the circumstances, the author's feelings are understandable. They might not be ready for reconciliation and need time or space to process their feelings. The author isn't being cruel by ignoring; they're protecting their emotional well-being.\n\nSo, considering the context, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a result of deep-seated issues and not from a place of meanness. They have the right to set boundaries and prioritize their healing.\n"
