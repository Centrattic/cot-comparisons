My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't returned the love messages from their mother. The backstory is pretty intense: the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, the author was in foster care, adopted, and only reconnected after 18. The mother had a lot of issues, including drug use during pregnancy, and now wants to be part of the author's life again after being absent. The author feels conflicted, seeing her as a stranger and struggling to forgive or love her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, ignoring someone who is trying to reach out could be seen as hurtful. But in this context, the author has a history of abandonment and trauma. The mother was absent for most of their life, had serious issues, and the author is now dealing with the aftermath. The author's decision not to respond might stem from a place of self-protection, not wanting to get hurt again. They might not feel safe or ready to reconnect. The mother's actions in the past had legal and emotional consequences, so the author's hesitation is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is now trying to make amends and is clean. She's reaching out with love and apologies. But the author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that they haven't spoken since the initial contact suggests that the author is still processing their feelings. Not responding to messages could be a way of maintaining those boundaries. It's not about being in the wrong, but about personal healing and emotional needs. \n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the author's trauma, and their current emotional state. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond if it's not in their best interest. So, considering all that, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author is dealing with a complex emotional situation and their actions are a result of past experiences.\n"
