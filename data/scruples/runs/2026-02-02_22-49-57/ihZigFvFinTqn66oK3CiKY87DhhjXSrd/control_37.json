My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they haven't been responding to their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages expressing love and support, but the author doesn't respond. The backstory is pretty intense: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to them being in a foster home and eventually adopted. They didn't know each other until after turning 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother, being separated from her for most of their life. The mom had serious issues with addiction and neglect. When they reconnect after 18, the author is trying to learn about their identity and origins but is met with the mom's lack of knowledge about their father and nationality. That must be really hurtful and confusing.\n\nThe author's current non-response is about not returning love messages. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not responding. On one hand, the mom is trying to reconnect after a long separation and is expressing regret. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not feeling connected and needing time to process their feelings. They were essentially strangers when they reconnected, and the mom's past actions caused significant harm.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional readiness. The author might not be ready to offer affection or rebuild a relationship after such a traumatic history. It's possible they're still dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and addiction in their family. The mom's attempts to communicate might be well-meaning, but the author's emotional distance is a protective measure.\n\nI should think about whether there's an expectation for the author to respond out of obligation. The mom might feel rejected, but the author's trauma might make it impossible to reciprocate love at this stage. It's about their mental health and healing process. The author isn't ignoring the texts out of meanness but possibly due to unresolved feelings and the complexity of their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid emotional and psychological reasons for not responding. The answer should be B.\n"
