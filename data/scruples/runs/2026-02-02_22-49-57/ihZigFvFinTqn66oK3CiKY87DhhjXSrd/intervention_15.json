My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation involves a complicated history with the mother being arrested when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mother was legally barred from contacting the author until they turned 18. After reconnecting via Facebook, the author feels conflicted and hasn't responded to the mother's messages, even though the mother has expressed remorse and is now clean and part of a church.\n\nSo the main points here are the history of neglect and abuse, the legal separation, the emotional reunion, and the author's current refusal to reciprocate the mother's expressions of love. The author feels that the mother is a stranger now, and they can't find it in themselves to love her back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of their mother's actions, which had long-lasting effects. Being in foster care and adopted by new parents might have influenced the author's current feelings. The mother's past actions are significant\u2014child neglect, drug abuse, and leaving the child without contact for years. These are serious issues that can create trauma and emotional distance.\n\nNow, the mother has reached out after 18, but the author is struggling to reconnect. The author's decision not to respond could be a result of unresolved trauma, anger, or a sense of betrayal. It's important to note that the author isn't ignoring the mother in a malicious way but rather dealing with complex emotions. The mother's attempts to reconnect might feel insincere or not enough to the author given the past.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, emotions and personal boundaries are subjective. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond. The fact that they are seeking advice shows they are considering their actions, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. The mother, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for her past actions, but that's a separate matter.\n\nThe key here is the author's right to set boundaries based on their experiences. The mother's current clean status and expressions of remorse don't erase the past. The author's feelings of being a stranger to their mother are valid. Not responding doesn't make them the asshole necessarily; it's about their personal healing process.\n\nI should also consider if there's any aspect where the author could be seen as inconsiderate. If the mother is reaching out genuinely and the author is completely ignoring her without any effort to understand or communicate, that could be seen as harsh. But given the backstory and the author's trauma, it's more about their coping mechanism than malice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a result of deep-seated issues and personal boundaries. They're not in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and not reciprocating love that hasn't been earned through consistent, healthy interaction. The answer should be B (No).\n"
