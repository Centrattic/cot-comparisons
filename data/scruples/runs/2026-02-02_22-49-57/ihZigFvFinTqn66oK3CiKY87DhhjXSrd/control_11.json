My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the person was 6 for drug abuse and neglect. They were put in foster care and then adopted by a couple they love. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. When they did reconnect, the mom admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not even knowing the child's father. The mom is now clean, religious, and wants to reconnect, but the person can't bring themselves to respond to her messages.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're the asshole for not responding. The question is whether they're in the wrong. I need to consider the context. From what I read, the person had a traumatic childhood because of their mother's actions. The mother abandoned them, had serious issues, and it's understandable that the person might feel anger or resentment. They were in a stable environment with their adoptive parents. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the user can't forgive her. \n\nIs it fair to say the user is in the wrong? Well, they haven't done anything harmful to their mother. They're not ignoring her out of spite but because of past trauma. The mother's actions led to the separation. The user is dealing with complex emotions and isn't engaging because they feel disconnected. I don't think they're in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries based on their experiences. So, the answer should be B (No)."
