My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not responding to their mom's messages for four years. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: the person's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The kid was put in foster care and then adopted by a new family. They had a good relationship with the adoptive parents. After turning 18, the biological mom contacted them via Facebook. She was apologetic, but there were some unsettling revelations\u2014like not knowing the father's identity and using drugs during pregnancy. Since then, the person hasn't spoken to her, even though she sends messages expressing love and regret. The person feels conflicted because they want to know more but can't find it in themselves to reciprocate love, considering her a stranger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages. Let's consider the dynamics here. The mother had a history of substance abuse and neglect, leading to the child's removal. The child was adopted and raised by a different family, which probably provided a stable environment. When contact resumed, the biological mom's actions were harmful, and the child is now an adult processing that trauma.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, it's common for individuals who have experienced abandonment or neglect to struggle with trust and emotional connections, especially with the parent who caused the harm. The author might be dealing with unresolved trauma, anger, or fear of betrayal. Not responding to messages could be a coping mechanism to protect their emotional well-being. The mother, while clean and apologetic, may not fully grasp the depth of the hurt caused, leading to messages that feel insincere or overwhelming to the recipient.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reconnect and express love, which could be seen as a positive step. However, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a history. The fact that they haven't engaged in conversation suggests that any messages from the mother might not be received in the intended way. The author isn't obligated to reciprocate feelings when they feel they can't trust or understand this person.\n\nAdditionally, the author's adoptive parents provided a nurturing environment, which is crucial. The author's identity and well-being are tied to that family. The biological mother's re-entry could complicate that, and the author's choice to not engage might be a way to maintain stability.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's generally expected to show some level of respect or acknowledgment, the situation isn't typical. The historical context of neglect and the emotional impact of the revelations might justify the author's actions. They're not being inconsiderate without reason; they're dealing with deep-seated issues from their past.\n\nSo, considering the trauma, the lack of a prior relationship, and the author's need to protect their mental health, it's likely that the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not responding, and it's their choice how to handle this relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
