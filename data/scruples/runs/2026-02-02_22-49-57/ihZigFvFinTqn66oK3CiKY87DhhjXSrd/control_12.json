My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author explains a pretty traumatic background: their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and adopted. After 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but the author feels conflicted about reconnecting because of the past.\n\nThe mom sends messages expressing love and trying to build a relationship, but the author doesn't respond. The key points here are the history of abuse and neglect, the forced separation until 18, the sudden reconnection, and the author's emotional response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if ignoring the messages is wrong. The author has valid reasons for their feelings. They suffered abuse and neglect, were separated from their mom, and now she's trying to reconnect after a long absence. The author's emotional response is understandable given the trauma. They might not feel ready to engage, especially since the mom's past actions had a significant negative impact on their life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is making amends and trying to build a relationship now, and the author's silence could be seen as cutting her off without giving her a chance. But given the context, the author isn't ignoring her out of spite or selfishness; it's rooted in their traumatic experience. They're struggling with their feelings of resentment and the desire to reconnect versus the pain of the past.\n\nThe author is also dealing with identity issues, mentioned not knowing their father or nationality. The mom's lack of knowledge about her own child's background adds to the author's sense of loss and confusion. The mom's current efforts to be part of their life might feel insincere or too late, especially if the author hasn't received the same emotional support from her in the past.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the line between right and wrong can be blurry. However, the context here is crucial. The author's decision to not respond isn't malicious but rather a coping mechanism stemming from deep-seated trauma. People have the right to set boundaries, especially after such experiences. The author isn't in the wrong for needing time and space to process their feelings and decide whether they want to engage further. The mom's actions in the past caused harm, and the author is within their rights to prioritize their emotional well-being. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
