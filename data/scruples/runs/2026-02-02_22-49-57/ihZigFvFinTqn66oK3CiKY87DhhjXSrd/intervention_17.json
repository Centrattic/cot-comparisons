My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The situation is pretty heavy, with a history of child neglect, drug abuse, and being separated from the mother during childhood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care. They were legally blocked from contacting the author until they turned 18. When they finally reconnected, the mom's initial attempts were filled with uncertainty and regret. The author is now ignoring her messages, not because of malice, but because of unresolved trauma and feeling that this woman is a stranger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mom is reaching out, expressing love and regret, but the author hasn't returned those feelings. The key here is understanding the emotional and psychological impact of the mother's past actions. The author hasn't had a nurturing relationship with the mother; instead, the mother's absence and the traumatic circumstances of her arrest and the author's placement in foster care have left lasting effects.\n\nIn such cases, it's not uncommon for individuals to struggle with forgiveness or reconciliation, especially when the relationship was severed due to harmful actions. The author's decision to not engage doesn't immediately seem like a wrong choice from an emotional standpoint. They might be protecting themselves from further pain. However, there's a nuance here: the mother is now trying to rebuild the relationship, which could be a valid point in her favor. But the author's feelings of being a stranger to her and the trauma from the past are significant factors.\n\nEthically, while the mother's current intentions might be good, the author is not obligated to reciprocate love or messages if doing so would cause them emotional distress. The concept of being \"in the wrong\" here might not apply in a black-and-white sense. The author's actions are a personal boundary set due to their history, which is a legitimate response to their experiences.\n\nAlso, considering the \"AITA\" framework, the community often looks at intent and circumstances. The author's intent is to protect their emotional well-being, not to be cruel. The mother's intent is to reconnect, but the author isn't in a place to engage. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their actions are rooted in their past trauma and need for self-preservation.\n"
