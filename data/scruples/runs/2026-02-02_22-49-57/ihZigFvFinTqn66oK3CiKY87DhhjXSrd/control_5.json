My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. Their mom had a rough history with drugs and neglect, leading to their separation when they were young. They were adopted, which they seem to appreciate, but when their mom reached out after 18, they found out she didn't even know who their father was, which was painful.\n\nThe user hasn't responded to her messages, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole. Well, considering the context, the person's mom wasn't part of their life growing up. The user had to deal with being in foster care and then being adopted. The mom's return after 18 was emotional but also brought up painful truths. The user isn't responding because they feel disconnected and hurt. They view her as a stranger despite her claims.\n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, it's understandable that they're struggling to reconcile their feelings. The mom's actions in the past had a significant impact on their life. The user's decision not to respond isn't out of malice but rather a lack of ability to connect. The mom is taking steps to be better, but rebuilding trust and familial bonds can't be forced. The user isn't at fault for needing time and space. So, the answer should be B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
