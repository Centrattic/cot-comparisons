My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't been responding to their mother's texts expressing love and missing them for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted by a new family. The author found out about their mom's situation later, but it's all pretty traumatic. The mom tried to reconnect after 18, but the author feels disconnected and can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. Let me break this down. On one hand, the mother is reaching out, showing she wants to be part of the author's life again. She's expressed regret and is clean now. Not responding might be seen as cutting her off, which could be harsh. On the other hand, the author has a valid history of trauma. The mother was absent for years due to legal issues and addiction, causing the author to be separated from their biological family. The author was raised by adoptive parents they love. The emotional scars are deep, and the author is struggling to reconcile this biological mother with the parent they know.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not black and white. But the key here is the author's emotional state and the history. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author is dealing with that. Not responding might be a way to protect themselves from further emotional pain. The mother's texts are filled with love, but the author hasn't received that love during their formative years. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. They have a right to set boundaries based on their past experiences. The mother, while trying to reconnect, needs to respect that the author might not be ready. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
