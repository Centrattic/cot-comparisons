My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's texts for four years. The author has a complicated history with their mother, including child neglect and drug abuse, which led to separation. The mother tried to reconnect after 18, but the author feels hurt and disconnected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was arrested for serious issues, leading to the child being placed in foster care. The author was cut off from their mother for years and then, upon reconnecting, the mother couldn't provide answers the author was seeking. The author is struggling with forgiveness and acceptance, which is understandable given the trauma.\n\nNext, the mother's actions. She's clean now, found religion, and expresses regret. But the author sees her as a stranger. The key point here is the author's emotional state and their right to process this on their own terms. The mother's outreach is genuine, but the author hasn't been able to form a bond yet. There's no indication the author is being cruel or dismissive without reason. They're dealing with the aftermath of abandonment and betrayal.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author is obligated to respond. The mother's texts are about love and connection, but the author's trauma might make it impossible to reciprocate. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but out of unresolved feelings. So, in this context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're navigating a complex emotional situation, and healing takes time. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
