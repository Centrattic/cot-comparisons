      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined and took their daughter home instead. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to the park specifically to pick up their daughter. The friend was there, but it wasn't the parent's obligation to provide transportation for the friend. The daughter's friend needing a ride home isn't something the parent is necessarily responsible for unless there's prior agreement.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an assumption that the parent might have offered a ride, but the parent declined. But the parent isn't obligated to. If the parent didn't know the friend well, or if they weren't responsible for the friend, then declining makes sense. The key is whether the parent had any responsibility towards the friend. If the friend was left at the park, maybe the parent should have ensured that the friend could get home safely, but if the park is in a safe area and it's 6 PM, perhaps it's reasonable for the friend to find another way.\n\nAlso, the parent's main duty is to their daughter. They were doing what they were supposed to do by picking up their child. The friend's situation is a secondary issue. Unless there's more context, like the friend was in a vulnerable situation or the parent had agreed to take the friend home, the parent isn't at fault. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people are often called out for not doing something, but in this case, the parent did what they needed to do. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But maybe some people would argue that it's considerate to offer a ride, but declining isn't wrong. So the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
