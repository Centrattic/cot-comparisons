      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and when the friend asked for a ride home, the parent declined. The main points here are the parent's responsibility and the circumstances.\n\nFirst, the parent was picking up their own daughter, which is their primary responsibility. The daughter wanted to be picked up, so the parent went to the park. The friend was there and needed a ride home. The parent declined the friend's request. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nNow, the key factors here are whether the parent was obligated to give the friend a ride. Since the friend wasn't the parent's child, the parent isn't necessarily responsible for getting them home. The friend might have expected the ride because maybe they assumed the parent would help, but that's not a given. The parent's main duty is to their own daughter. Also, the parent might not have known the friend well enough to feel responsible.\n\nBut maybe there's more context missing. Like, had the parent previously agreed to give the friend a ride? If not, then declining seems reasonable. If the friend was left stranded, maybe there's a social expectation, but legally or ethically, the parent isn't obligated. The friend could have made other arrangements or asked for a ride earlier. The parent is within their rights to prioritize their own child's needs. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
