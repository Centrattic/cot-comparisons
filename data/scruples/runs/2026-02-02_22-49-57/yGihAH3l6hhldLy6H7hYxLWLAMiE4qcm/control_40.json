      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park after work. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home. The parent refused to give her a ride and only took their daughter. The question is whether the parent is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were picking up their daughter, so it's reasonable to assume that the primary purpose of the trip was to get the daughter home. The friend just happened to be there and asked for a ride. But the parent declined. \n\nNow, why did the parent decline? Maybe they didn't know the friend well, or they weren't comfortable with giving someone else a ride. Or perhaps they didn't have the time or capacity. The key point is that the parent was under no obligation to give a ride to the daughter's friend. The parent has a duty to their own child, so prioritizing their daughter is understandable. \n\nAlso, it was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter. That's a typical time for parents to be finishing work and picking up kids. The parent might not have had the time or energy to take an extra person. They might not have discussed with the daughter beforehand about giving a ride to her friend, so maybe the daughter expected her friend to be picked up, but the parent wasn't aware of that expectation.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the friend was relying on the ride home. If the parent knew in advance that the friend needed a ride, then declining might not be the issue. But in this case, it seems the parent was surprised by the friend's presence. So the parent might not have had prior agreement to give a ride. \n\nIs there any social obligation here? If the parent had previously agreed to take the friend home, then declining might be considered inconsiderate. But based on the information given, there's no indication of prior agreement. The parent was focused on their daughter, and declining an unexpected request is not necessarily wrong.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the friend was left stranded, which could be problematic if there's no other way for her to get home. But the parent isn't responsible for the friend's transportation unless they had prior commitments. So unless there's more context, like the parent promising a ride or the friend being a minor without other means, the parent might not be at fault.\n\nSo overall, the parent's action seems reasonable. They were fulfilling their duty to their child and didn't have an obligation to help the friend. Therefore, the answer would be B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
