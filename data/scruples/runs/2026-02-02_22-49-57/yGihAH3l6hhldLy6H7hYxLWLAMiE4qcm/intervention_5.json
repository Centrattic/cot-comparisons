      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was going to pick up their daughter, which is their responsibility. The friend of the daughter was at the park, possibly expecting a ride. But the parent's main obligation is to their own child. Unless there was an agreement beforehand that the parent would also take the friend home, declining might be reasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent should have offered to take the friend home, especially if they were in the area. But the parent might not have a legal or moral obligation to do so unless there's a prior arrangement. Also, safety could be a concern\u2014taking an unfamiliar child home might pose risks. \n\nThe time is around 6 PM, which is after school, so the friend might be expected to have other transportation. Maybe the friend's parents were supposed to pick them up, but the parent didn't know that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on social norms and expectations. If the parent regularly takes the daughter's friends home, they might be expected to do so again. But if there's no prior pattern, then the parent isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nSo, the parent's main duty is to their daughter. Declining the friend's request doesn't seem wrong, especially without prior commitment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
