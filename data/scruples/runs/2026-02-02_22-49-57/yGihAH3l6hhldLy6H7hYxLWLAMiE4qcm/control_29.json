      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. Then they drove the daughter home. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. When they went to the park, their intention was to pick up their daughter. The daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride. The parent said no. Now, the question is whether that was wrong.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to prioritize their own child's safety and needs. However, the friend might have been left without transportation, possibly leading to her having to find another way home. But, the parent might not be obligated to give a ride unless there was prior agreement. Maybe the friend was expecting the parent to know they needed a ride, but the parent didn't have that information. Alternatively, the parent might not be comfortable with giving rides to other people's kids without permission from their parents.\n\nAlso, the time was around 6 PM. If the friend is a minor, being left at the park after school hours could be an issue if she doesn't have another way home. But if the friend is an adult, maybe it's less of a problem. However, the scenario doesn't specify the friend's age. Assuming the daughter is a child, the friend is likely another child, which complicates things because leaving a child unattended isn't advisable.\n\nBut the parent's duty is to their own child. If the daughter's friend asked for a ride, the parent could have said they can't take her home without permission from her parents. Alternatively, maybe the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride. The parent might not have a responsibility to offer a ride unless they had previously agreed to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was counting on the parent to take her home, then the parent might be at fault for not arranging for her transportation. However, without prior communication, it's hard to say. The parent's action of declining is their right, but maybe they should have considered informing the friend's parents or making another arrangement. But if the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride, they can't be blamed for not offering.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's decision might not be in the wrong because they were fulfilling their responsibility to their own child. They might not have an obligation to take another child home unless there was an agreement. However, if the friend was left without any means of getting home and it was the parent's responsibility, then maybe they are in the wrong. But since the parent explicitly declined the request, they might not be at fault. The answer would depend on the circumstances not fully provided, but based on the given info, the parent isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
