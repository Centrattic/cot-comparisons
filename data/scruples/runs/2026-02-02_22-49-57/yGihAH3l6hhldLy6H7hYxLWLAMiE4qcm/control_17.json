      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, but the daughter's friend also wanted a ride home. The parent declined, and then took their daughter home. The time was around six in the evening.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main question is whether the parent made a wrong decision by not giving the friend a ride. So, factors to consider: Was there an agreement beforehand? Did the parent know the friend needed a ride? Was the parent responsible for the friend's transportation?\n\nThe parent's primary responsibility is their own daughter. If the daughter wanted to be picked up, the parent's main duty is to her. The friend was not their child, so there's no obligation to take her home unless there was a prior arrangement. The parent might not have been aware that the friend needed a ride, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. \n\nBut wait, the friend \"apparently needed a ride home.\" The parent declined her. Did the parent have a reason to know that the friend needed a ride? If the daughter was the one who arranged the playdate, maybe the parent assumed the friend would have a ride. Or maybe the friend asked the parent. If the parent was informed and still declined, maybe they should have considered offering to drop her off, but it's not necessarily their fault if the friend wasn't their responsibility. \n\nAlso, the time was around six. Depending on the context, maybe it's getting dark, which could be a concern. But the parent's main responsibility is their own child. Unless there was a prior agreement to take the friend home, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend might be expected to arrange her own transportation, or the parents of the friend should be responsible. \n\nSo, unless the parent agreed to take the friend home, they aren't obligated. The parent's action of picking up their daughter and declining the friend is within their rights. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
