      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter and found the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home, but the parent declined. The time was around six.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The parent's main responsibility is their daughter. They were going to pick her up, so the friend's presence might have been unexpected. Declining the friend's ride could be seen as a boundary between parental duties and the friend's needs. Parents aren't responsible for their children's friends' transportation unless they've agreed to it beforehand. So the parent might not be in the wrong here.\n\nHowever, another angle is that the friend might have been relying on the parent for a ride. But usually, it's the kid's responsibility to arrange their own transportation, especially when visiting friends. The parent isn't necessarily obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. Also, the parent might not know the friend well enough to offer a ride, so safety could be a concern.\n\nThe time was around six, which isn't too late, but maybe the park closes later? The friend might have had other options, like waiting for a parent or a ride from another friend. The parent was focused on their daughter, which is reasonable. So in this case, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
