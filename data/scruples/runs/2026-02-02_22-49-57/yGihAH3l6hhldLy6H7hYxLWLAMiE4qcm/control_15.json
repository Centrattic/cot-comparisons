      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nSo, the situation: The parent was going to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The main duty here is to their own child. Parents are responsible for their children's safety and well-being. If the friend was not under the parent's care, the parent isn't obligated to take them. But maybe the friend was left there by mistake? Or was it a usual arrangement?\n\nThe key point is that the parent's primary responsibility is their daughter. Unless there was an agreement or expectation that the parent would also transport the friend, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend might have thought they were supposed to be picked up, but unless there's more context, like the parent usually takes other kids or it was arranged beforehand, the parent isn't obligated. \n\nAlso, it was 6 PM. Depending on where they live, it might be getting dark, so the parent might have been concerned about the friend being left alone. But the parent didn't know that, so maybe they should have asked if the friend had a ride. However, the parent's main duty is to their own child. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a prior agreement, a parent isn't responsible for others' children. The friend's parents might be at fault for not arranging transportation. The parent in the story didn't do anything wrong by not picking up the friend. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
