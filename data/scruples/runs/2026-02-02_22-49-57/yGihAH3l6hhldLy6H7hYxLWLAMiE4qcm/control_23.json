      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home. The parent declined, took their daughter home, and it was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the parent's responsibility. The parent was specifically going to get their daughter, not the friend. The friend's need for a ride wasn't the parent's responsibility unless there was a prior agreement. Maybe the daughter had mentioned that her friend would need a ride, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The parent might not have known they were responsible for the friend. \n\nAlso, the parent might not be the friend's parent, so it's not their duty to take them home. However, if the daughter's friend was in a dangerous situation or needed help, maybe the parent should have done something. But the scenario doesn't indicate any emergencies. \n\nAnother angle is the time of day. 6 PM might be when the friend is supposed to be home, but the parent's main obligation is to their own child. The friend's parents should be responsible for getting them home. The parent might have thought that the friend's parents would pick them up, especially if they didn't know the friend well. \n\nBut maybe the daughter's friend was waiting for the parent to take her home because the parents were unavailable. If the daughter didn't inform her parent about the friend needing a ride, then the parent isn't to blame. However, if the daughter expected the parent to take both, the parent might be at fault for not accommodating. The scenario doesn't mention the daughter asking for the friend to be picked up. \n\nSo, unless there was an expectation or prior arrangement, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's possible the friend's parents should have been informed or picked her up themselves. The parent's main responsibility is their own child, so declining the friend's ride request wasn't their duty. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
