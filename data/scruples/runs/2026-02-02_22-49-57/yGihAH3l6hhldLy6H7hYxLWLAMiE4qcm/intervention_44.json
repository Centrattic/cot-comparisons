      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home. The parent declined and only took their daughter. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible reasons for declining. The parent might have had legitimate reasons, like not wanting to take someone else's child without permission, or maybe there were safety concerns. Parents often have policies about picking up others' kids unless arranged in advance. Also, the parent might not have known the friend well enough to assume responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have expected a ride since it was late, and parents might sometimes help out neighbors or friends' kids. But unless there was a prior agreement, the parent isn't obligated to give a ride. The parent's main responsibility is their own child, so prioritizing that makes sense.\n\nThere's no mention of the parent being cruel or refusing help without cause. The key is whether there was an expectation for the ride. If the friend just asked and the parent said no, that's different from the parent making plans to take them. Without prior arrangement, the parent isn't at fault. So I think the answer is B.\n"
