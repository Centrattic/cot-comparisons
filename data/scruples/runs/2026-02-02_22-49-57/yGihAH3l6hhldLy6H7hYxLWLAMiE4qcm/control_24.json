      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and there was a friend there who wanted a ride home. The parent declined to give her a ride and then went home. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent's main responsibility is to their own daughter. They were called to pick her up, so their obligation is to her. The friend's situation might be a separate issue. \n\nBut wait, maybe the parent should have considered whether the friend was in a vulnerable position. If the friend was a minor, then the parent might have a duty to ensure she gets home safely. However, the parent wasn't asked to take the friend home specifically, just because she needed a ride. If the parent is not responsible for the friend, then maybe it's not their problem. \n\nHowever, the parent might be expected to help if the friend is a minor and there's no other adult present. But the parent might not have known the friend's circumstances. Also, the parent was already there to pick up their daughter, so maybe they shouldn't be expected to take on additional responsibility unless they volunteered for it. \n\nAnother angle: the parent might have thought it's their daughter's responsibility to get her friend home, like offering a ride after school. But if the friend needed a ride and the parent had the opportunity, maybe there's an expectation to help. However, the parent isn't legally obligated unless there's a specific relationship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes parents help other kids when they can, but it's not always required. The parent might feel they were just doing their own duty by picking up their daughter. The friend's parent might be responsible for arranging transportation. \n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong since they were fulfilling their responsibility to their daughter. Unless there's an explicit agreement to take the friend, the parent isn't obligated. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
