      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter and was asked by the daughter's friend for a ride home, but the parent declined. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their daughter, which is their responsibility. The friend of the daughter asked for a ride home. But the parent declined. Why might that be? Maybe they didn't know the friend well, weren't comfortable with giving a ride, or had other plans. But the friend was left at the park. That could be an issue if the friend wasn't able to get home safely afterward.\n\nBut the key points here are: the parent's duty is to their own child. Maybe the friend's parents weren't aware that the parent would be picking her up, so the friend might have assumed it. If the parent was unaware that the friend needed a ride, then it's not their responsibility. However, if the friend was expecting the parent to take her, maybe the parent should have communicated better or arranged a different way for her to get home. \n\nAlso, the parent might not have the obligation to take someone else's child unless it's arranged. The parent might have valid reasons, like not knowing the child, not feeling responsible, or not wanting to take on additional responsibilities. But if the friend was left stranded, that could be a problem. However, the friend might have other ways to get home, like waiting for their own parent or using public transport. \n\nAnother angle: the parent was coming to pick up their daughter, and the daughter might have asked the friend to come along. If the daughter didn't inform her friend that her parent wouldn't take her home, maybe the daughter is partly responsible. But the parent's responsibility is to their own child, not necessarily the friend. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might not be in the wrong because they weren't obligated to take the friend. Unless there was an expectation that the parent would take both, which isn't clear here. The parent could have offered to arrange a ride for the friend instead of just declining, but maybe they felt it wasn't their duty. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their responsibility to their daughter and didn't have an obligation to the friend.\n"
