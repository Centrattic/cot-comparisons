      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent went to the park to pick up their daughter. When they got there, the daughter's friend was also there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's primary responsibility is their own child. The friend was not under their care, so the parent isn't obligated to give them a ride. The daughter wanted to be picked up, so the parent did that. The friend was left behind, but the parent didn't have a duty to take her. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the parent have a prior agreement to take the friend? The story doesn't mention that. The parent might not have known the friend needed a ride until arriving. The daughter might have mentioned it, but the parent didn't. Maybe the daughter didn't mention her friend needing a ride. If the parent had no prior knowledge, it's not their fault. \n\nAnother angle: The parent's responsibility is to their child. Unless there's a legal or agreed-upon responsibility for the friend, the parent isn't wrong. The friend should have made alternative arrangements. \n\nSo, unless there's more context suggesting the parent should have known or agreed to take the friend, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong. The main duty is to the daughter, and they fulfilled that by picking her up. The friend's situation was their own responsibility.\n"
