      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. They went to pick up their daughter, found the friend there who needed a ride, but they declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, the main point here is whether the friend had a right to expect a ride. The friend might have thought that since the parent came to pick up their daughter, they'd also take the friend. But the parent only has a responsibility to their own child, not the friend. Unless there was an agreement beforehand that the parent would take the friend home, there's no obligation. \n\nAlso, the parent's primary duty is to their child. Maybe the friend was supposed to be picked up by someone else, or maybe they assumed the parent would help. But the parent isn't responsible for others' children unless they agreed to. So declining the friend seems reasonable. \n\nAnother angle: was the friend left in a dangerous situation? If it was late, maybe. But the park might still be safe enough. The parent can't be responsible for everyone else's kids. Unless the friend is a minor and there's no one else to pick them up, but the scenario doesn't say that. The parent didn't know about the friend needing a ride until arrival, so couldn't have planned for it. \n\nSo, unless there's more context suggesting the parent had a prior agreement to take the friend, the answer would be no, they're not in the wrong. They didn't have to take the friend home. The friend should have arranged their own transportation. The parent's action seems justified.\n"
