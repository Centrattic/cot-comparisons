      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The time was around six PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. They were there to pick up their own child, which is their primary responsibility. The friend's need for a ride isn't something the parent is obligated to fulfill unless there's some prior agreement. \n\nBut wait, maybe the parent should have offered to take the friend as well if possible. However, the parent might not have known that the friend needed a ride. If the friend just showed up and asked, the parent might not have a duty to help. Also, the parent might not want to take a stranger home without knowing their situation. \n\nAnother angle: Is the parent expected to help a child's friend? It depends on the context. If the friend was with the daughter, maybe the parent thought it was a playdate and the friend's parent was supposed to pick them up. But since the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride, they might not be at fault. \n\nAlso, the time was six PM, which is getting late. Leaving a child alone might be a concern if the friend couldn't wait. But the parent might not have any way of knowing if the friend had other plans or if it was safe for her to stay. \n\nSo, the parent's action was to pick up their own daughter and decline the friend. Unless there's a specific reason they should have known to help, like if the friend was left in their care, they might not be in the wrong. The key is whether the parent had an obligation to the friend. Since it's a friend of the daughter, not their own child, the parent isn't legally or morally bound to help unless there's a specific situation. \n\nTherefore, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. They fulfilled their duty to their daughter and didn't have to accommodate the friend's request.\n"
