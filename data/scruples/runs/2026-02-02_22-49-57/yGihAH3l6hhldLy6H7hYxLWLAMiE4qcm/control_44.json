      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent went to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home. The parent declined to give her a ride and only took their daughter home. The time was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter. The question is whether the parent is at fault (AITA).\n\nI need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, as the daughter wanted to be picked up. The friend's need for a ride home was a secondary situation. The parent might not be obligated to help someone else's child unless there was prior agreement or an expectation set. \n\nThe daughter's friend probably assumed that since the parent was there to pick up the daughter, they might also take the friend. But the parent's main duty is to their own child. Unless there was a prior arrangement or the parent had agreed to help the friend, it's reasonable for them to focus on their own responsibility. \n\nAlso, the time factor is mentioned\u2014around 6 PM. Depending on the area's lighting and safety, leaving someone at a park in the evening could be a concern. However, the friend might have been aware of the time and possibly had other plans or means, even though they needed a ride.\n\nAnother angle: the parent might not know the friend well enough to feel comfortable giving them a ride. There could be safety concerns or personal boundaries. The parent isn't legally or ethically required to assist others unless there's a specific duty, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent likely isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their responsibility to their daughter. The friend's situation was a request that wasn't agreed upon beforehand. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
