      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nFirst, the setup: The parent picks up their daughter from the park after work. When they arrive, there's the daughter's friend there who needs a ride home. The parent declines to give her a ride, probably because they were only there to pick up their own daughter. It was around 6 PM, so maybe they had a schedule to follow.\n\nI need to consider the parent's perspective. They were going to pick up their daughter, which was their main purpose. The friend wasn't expected, so it's understandable that they didn't want to take her. Maybe they weren't prepared to give someone else a ride, or they had plans after picking up their kid. Also, safety could be a factor\u2014parents might be cautious about taking other people's kids home without checking with the parents first.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend was counting on that ride. But the parent isn't responsible for ensuring the friend gets home, especially if they weren't asked in advance. The parent might not have known the friend needed a ride until they saw her there. It's a common situation where people might assume someone else will cover it, but the parent's main duty is to their own child. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their responsibility to their daughter. They might not have had a prior agreement to take the friend, so declining is reasonable. The friend should have made arrangements beforehand or informed the parents in advance.\n"
