      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park and declined to give a ride to the daughter's friend, who needed one. It was around six o'clock when they left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were called to pick up their daughter, so their immediate duty is to that child. The friend was not their responsibility, so declining to give a ride might be seen as reasonable. However, maybe the parent should have considered other options for the friend, like calling a parent or using another transportation method.\n\nBut wait, the parent might not be obligated to help someone else's child unless there was prior agreement. The friend's need for a ride home wasn't the parent's responsibility. Also, the timing is important\u2014it was six o'clock, which might be after school hours, and parents might expect their kids to be picked up at a certain time. If the friend was aware that the parent was only there for their own daughter, maybe she should have made her own arrangements.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the parent should have checked if the friend had a way home. However, the parent might not have known about the friend's situation beforehand. They might not have been aware that the friend needed a ride, so declining isn't necessarily being inconsiderate. But maybe it's socially polite to offer an option, like suggesting a ride if they could, but the parent chose not to.\n\nIs there any cultural or situational context I'm missing? In some cases, parents might be expected to help others' children if they can, but it's not a strict rule. The key here is that the parent was only responsible for their own child. So, unless there was an agreement to help the friend, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend should have made her own plans. Therefore, the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
