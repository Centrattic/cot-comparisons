      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to the park to pick up their daughter, found the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home, but declined to give her a ride. Then they went home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their daughter, which is their responsibility. The friend was not their child, so the parent isn't legally obligated to give her a ride. The question is whether declining to help the friend makes the parent an asshole.\n\nPossible angles: Was the parent expected to help the friend? Maybe the daughter knew the friend needed a ride and assumed the parent would take both. But the parent didn't agree to that. On the other hand, the parent might have felt it's not their responsibility. However, sometimes people expect that when you pick up a child, you might help others if possible. But the parent could also say they were only responsible for their own child.\n\nAlso, the time was around 6 PM. If the friend had no other means and it was getting dark or unsafe, maybe the parent should have offered help. But maybe the friend had other options. However, the parent didn't know that. The parent's decision might be seen as selfish, but others might say they aren't to blame.\n\nLooking at AITA examples, sometimes people are called out if they don't help someone in need, but if there's no obligation, it's not clear. The friend might have been expecting help, but the parent isn't necessarily wrong for saying no. The key is whether the parent acted unreasonably. If the parent had no prior agreement to take the friend, they might be in the clear. But if the daughter expected her friend to be taken, then maybe the parent should have considered that.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the expectations. If the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride and the daughter didn't mention it, then the parent isn't at fault. If the daughter expected the parent to help, maybe the parent should have offered a ride. But since the parent didn't agree, and the friend was left there, maybe the parent is in the wrong. Alternatively, the parent isn't responsible for the friend's transportation.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the parent isn't responsible for the friend. Unless there was an expectation, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The parent's duty is to their own child. So the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
