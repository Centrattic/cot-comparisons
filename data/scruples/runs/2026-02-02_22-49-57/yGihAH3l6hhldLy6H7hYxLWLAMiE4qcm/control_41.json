      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. So the situation is, they went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined, then took their daughter home. Time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The parent's responsibility is to their own daughter. The friend is a third party. The parent didn't have any prior agreement to take the friend home. So, is it the parent's duty to also take the friend?\n\nIn many cases, parents aren't responsible for other people's children unless they've agreed beforehand. The friend might be relying on the parent to take her home, but if the parent didn't make that commitment, then maybe they aren't at fault. Also, the parent might not have known the friend needed a ride. But since the daughter is the parent's child, the parent's primary duty is to her. \n\nAnother angle: if the daughter knew her friend needed a ride and didn't inform the parent beforehand, maybe the parent isn't to blame. The parent might not have realized the friend needed transportation. Also, the parent might have only gone to the park to pick up their own daughter, as stated. \n\nI should consider common social norms. Usually, parents aren't expected to take other kids home unless arranged. So the parent declining isn't necessarily wrong. Unless there was an expectation set that the parent would take both, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong. They had no obligation to take the friend, and their main responsibility is their own child.\n"
