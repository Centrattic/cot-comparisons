      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The parent picks up their daughter from the park after work. There, they meet the daughter's friend, who asks for a ride home. The parent declines and only takes their daughter. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the parent is in the wrong. Let's consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which they did. The friend was not their own child, so there's no obligation to provide a ride unless there's a prior agreement or some expectation set.\n\nBut maybe the daughter's friend expected the parent to give her a ride because they came to the park to pick up both? If the daughter had communicated that her friend needed a ride, maybe the parent should have known. However, the parent didn't take the friend home, so perhaps the friend wasn't supposed to be picked up. \n\nAnother angle: Time of day. It was six, which might be when the parent is ending their workday. They might have a limited window to get home, and maybe their daughter is the priority. There's no mention of the parent making a promise to the friend, so declining seems reasonable. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the daughter's friend is in a situation where she can't get home otherwise. If the parent knew that the friend had no other means, refusing could be seen as neglecting a responsibility. But the post doesn't mention that. So without that information, the parent's decision to take only their daughter might be justifiable. \n\nAlso, in terms of social norms, when a parent picks up a child from a park, they might expect to take only that child. The friend not being their own kid, the parent isn't obligated. So the parent isn't in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
