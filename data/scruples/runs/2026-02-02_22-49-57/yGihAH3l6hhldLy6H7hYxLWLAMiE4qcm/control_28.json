      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter at the park around 6 PM, and the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home, but the parent declined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. The daughter wanted to be picked up, so the parent went to the park. The friend was there, but the parent didn't offer a ride. Was there an expectation that the parent would give the friend a ride? Maybe the friend assumed that since the parent was picking up the daughter, they'd also take her friend. But the parent might not have that responsibility unless there was prior agreement.\n\nThe time is around 6 PM, which might be normal for picking up a child, depending on the park's hours or the parent's schedule. The key points here are whether the parent had an obligation to the friend. If the parent didn't promise to take the friend, then it's not necessarily their fault. However, if the parent usually does this or if the friend was left in a situation where they couldn't get home otherwise, maybe there's some responsibility.\n\nBut from the details given, there's no mention of the parent agreeing to take the friend. The parent's main duty is to their child. Unless there was a prior agreement or the friend was dependent on the parent for transportation, the parent isn't in the wrong. The friend might have needed to arrange their own ride or communicate their need more clearly. So the answer is probably B, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
