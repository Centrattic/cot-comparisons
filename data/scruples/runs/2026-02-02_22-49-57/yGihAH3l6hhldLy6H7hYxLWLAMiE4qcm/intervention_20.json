      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person asked if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that they went to pick up their daughter from the park around 6 PM. Their daughter wanted a ride home, so they drove her. The daughter's friend was there, and the friend needed a ride. The author declined the friend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the parent was picking up their own child, not responsible for the friend. The friend needed a ride, but was the parent obligated to offer one? Well, unless the parent had prior agreement or responsibility for the friend, they might not be in the wrong. The friend's need isn't the parent's responsibility unless they've taken on that role. Also, timing is around 6 PM, which is after work, so maybe the parent was just trying to get their daughter home after a long day. The friend should have arranged her own transportation or let her parents know she needed a ride. The parent didn't have to take her, so probably not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
