      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent picked up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, which the parent declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. The parent's main obligation is to their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable that they focused on her first. The friend was there, but the parent isn't responsible for the friend's welfare unless there's some prior agreement or expectation of responsibility. \n\nNext, the timing: 6 PM isn't that late, but maybe the friend's parents expect her home at a certain time. However, the parent doesn't have any obligation to the friend unless they've committed to doing so. The daughter's friend might have assumed the parent would give a ride because they were picking up her friend's daughter, but that's an assumption. The parent isn't necessarily at fault for not offering a ride unless there's a history of such arrangements.\n\nAlso, the parent might be concerned about safety or their own schedule. They might not feel comfortable giving a ride to someone they don't know well, even if that person is their child's friend. There's no indication that the friend was in any danger or that the parent was being negligent. \n\nThe daughter might have a responsibility to help her friend, but the parent isn't required to. The key point is that the parent's primary duty is to their own child. Unless there's more context\u2014like the friend was left in a dangerous situation or it's a recurring issue\u2014it seems the parent isn't wrong here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure there's no hidden context. The scenario seems straightforward. The parent did what they came to do, and declining the ride request doesn't make them wrong. The friend should have arranged her own transportation or asked her parents earlier.\n"
