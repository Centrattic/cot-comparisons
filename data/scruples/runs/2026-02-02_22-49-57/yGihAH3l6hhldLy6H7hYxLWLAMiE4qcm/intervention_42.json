      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author went to the park to pick up their daughter after work. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who wanted a ride home, but the author declined. The time was around six when they picked up the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main responsibility is their daughter, so they probably went to pick her up. The friend asked for a ride, but maybe the author didn't want to take her because they were done with their errand. But maybe the friend expected to be picked up as well since she was there.\n\nBut wait, the author's responsibility is to their own child. Unless there was a prior agreement to pick up the friend, the author isn't obligated. The friend might have assumed, but the author could have said no without being wrong. Also, considering that it was six PM, maybe there's a safety concern. If the friend was left alone, but the park might have been safe. However, the friend might be a minor, so leaving a minor alone could be an issue depending on local laws. But the story doesn't mention the friend's age or if she was an adult. Assuming the friend is an adult, then the author isn't responsible. If the friend is a minor, maybe the parent of the friend should have picked her up. The author didn't know she was there, maybe. So without prior arrangement, saying no is their right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
