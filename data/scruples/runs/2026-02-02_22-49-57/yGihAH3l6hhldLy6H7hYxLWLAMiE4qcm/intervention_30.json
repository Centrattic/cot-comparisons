      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was picking up their daughter from the park after work. It was around 6 PM. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The author declined, then took their daughter home. The friend was left at the park.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author had a specific responsibility, which was to pick up their daughter. The daughter's friend showed up unannounced and asked for a ride. The author didn't know beforehand that the friend needed a ride. There's no mention of prior arrangements where the author agreed to take the friend home. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might have felt that their primary obligation was to their daughter. The friend's request came as a surprise, and the author might not have been in a position to accommodate an additional responsibility without prior notice. Also, it's evening, and leaving a teenager at the park isn't ideal, but the author didn't have any prior commitment to the friend.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered the friend's situation. If the friend needed a ride and there were no other options, the author could have offered to drop the friend off after picking up their daughter. But the author didn't have any obligation here. The daughter's friend isn't their responsibility. Unless there was a prior agreement, the author isn't obligated to help. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the friend expected the author to know they needed a ride. But since the friend only asked when the author arrived, there's no way the author could have prepared. Also, the author might not have had the capacity to take two teenagers home, especially if they were alone. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a specific task, and the friend's request was unexpected. The author isn't responsible for the friend's transportation unless they agreed beforehand. Therefore, answer B.\n"
