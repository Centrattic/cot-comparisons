      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park.\n\nSo, the situation: The parent was going to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined her ride and then took their daughter home. It was around 6 PM. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is to their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which is a reasonable expectation. The daughter's friend showing up at the park might not have been planned. The parent might not have known in advance that the friend would be there or that she needed a ride.\n\nNow, the parent's actions: They declined the friend's request for a ride. The daughter's friend might be a minor, so parents might be cautious about giving rides to others' kids. There could be safety concerns. Also, the parent might not have a prior arrangement to take the friend home. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have expected that since the parent was picking up the daughter, they could also take the friend, especially if it's on the same route. But the parent isn't necessarily obligated to do that unless it was previously agreed.\n\nAnother angle: The time was 6 PM, which might be considered a reasonable time for a child to be at the park, but maybe the friend's parents weren't aware she would be there. However, the parent isn't responsible for someone else's child unless they've assumed that responsibility.\n\nPossible points to consider: \n- Did the parent know beforehand that the friend would need a ride? If not, they can't be blamed for not preparing for an unexpected situation.\n- Could there have been a way to arrange a ride for the friend without involving the parent? The friend's parents should ideally provide transportation.\n- Is there a cultural or societal expectation in their area about helping with friends' rides? That might vary, but generally, parents aren't required to transport others' children unless it's agreed upon.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The friend might not have had other options, but that's on the friend's parents to ensure. The parent's own child is their priority. The parent might not have the means or time to provide another ride, especially if they were just picking up their own child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong because they weren't responsible for the friend's transportation. They had a right to prioritize their own child's needs. The friend's parents should have arranged for her ride, not expecting someone else to do it without prior notice. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
