I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend, and they assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt and thinks they were snubbed. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the wedding party, even though they understand it's the friend's choice.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and the nature of the friendship. The author might feel slighted because they expected to be included, especially given the past. But the friend might have chosen others for her own reasons, maybe due to recent drift or personal reasons.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. From a traditional perspective, attending a wedding is a social expectation, but it's not a legal obligation. The author is weighing their feelings against the effort required to attend. They also mention wanting to focus on more reciprocal friendships.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. However, others might see it as optional if you're not part of the wedding party. The author is not cutting off the friend entirely but is choosing to distance themselves post-wedding.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the friendship is becoming one-sided, they don't want to invest in it. That's a valid personal choice. However, some might argue that attending the wedding is a gesture of goodwill, even if they're not in the wedding party.\n\nBut the author is not attending out of spite; they're hurt and feel undervalued. They're making a decision based on their own feelings and future plans. Since the friend didn't communicate properly and the author isn't being hostile (they just won't attend and will cut contact), it's more of a self-respect issue.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B\u2014Not in the wrong. They're acting on their feelings and not attending isn't malicious. The friend might be at fault for not communicating reasons or at least being more considerate. The author isn't obligated to attend if it makes them uncomfortable, especially if they feel the friendship isn't mutual anymore.\n"
