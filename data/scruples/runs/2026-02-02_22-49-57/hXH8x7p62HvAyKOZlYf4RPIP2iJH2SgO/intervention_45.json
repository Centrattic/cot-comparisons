I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author is a 15-year friend, and she was surprised when she found out about the wedding on Facebook. She assumed she would be the maid of honor since her friend was her maid of honor at her own wedding. However, the friend chose someone else for the maid of honor and didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands the friend might have drifted apart. Now, she's considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the author had versus the reality. She felt it was implied she would be part of the wedding party, especially given the previous role her friend had in her wedding. Being left out is hurtful, and she's questioning whether it's appropriate to skip the wedding as a result.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, weddings are personal events, and the bride chooses her wedding party based on her current relationships. However, long-time friends might expect a certain level of inclusion. The author's decision not to attend because she's not in the wedding party might be seen as understandable, especially since attending involves financial and time commitments. But some might argue that attending is a gesture of goodwill, regardless of the wedding party role.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to continue the friendship, which complicates things. If she's already planning to distance herself, not attending could be a way to avoid an awkward situation. However, it's possible that the friend didn't realize the impact of not including her, especially if they've drifted apart.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and the reasonableness of expectations. The author's expectation of being a bridesmaid might not have been communicated clearly, so the bride might not have realized it was important. The author's response (not attending) is a personal choice, but it's not necessarily in the wrong because she's prioritizing her feelings and setting boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision to not attend is her choice, and she's allowed to prioritize her own feelings and the state of the friendship.\n"
