I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been friends with their friend for over 15 years. They got engaged, and the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor in return, but the friend chose someone else. The author found out through Facebook, which was a disappointment. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, and they're questioning if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend didn't inform the author about the wedding first, which was hurtful. The author expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated by having the friend as their maid of honor. When they saw the wedding party list online, they realized they weren't included. Now, the author is thinking of not attending due to the emotional hurt and the cost of traveling, and they don't plan to stay in contact after.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. In social norms, attending a friend's wedding is considered a significant gesture, especially for someone who has been close for so long. However, there are nuances here. The author wasn't invited to be in the wedding party, which is a big deal. The friend didn't inform them first, which might indicate a shift in their relationship. The author feels slighted, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nBut weddings are the couple's event, and the bride chooses her bridesmaids. The author's absence might be seen as a snub, but given the circumstances, they're hurt and not in the wedding party. The cost and effort of attending might not be worth it if the friendship is already strained. The author also mentions they want to focus on friends who value them, which is a reasonable stance.\n\nI should consider cultural expectations. In many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there are extenuating circumstances. However, if the friendship has deteriorated, it's a personal decision. The author's feelings are valid, and they're not obligated to attend if they're not part of the wedding party. The fact that the friend didn't reach out first or include them in the wedding party could justify their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a long-time friend should attend regardless. But the author is considering the one-sided nature of the friendship now. They might feel it's not a balanced relationship anymore. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They have valid reasons\u2014feeling excluded, the friendship drifting, and personal decision to focus on more reciprocal relationships. The bride's choice of wedding party is her right, but the author's reaction is understandable given the context. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
