I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is that they were best friends for 15 years, got married with the friend as maid of honor, but now the friend is getting married and didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending because they're embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around weddings. Attending a friend's wedding is traditionally expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there's also the aspect of personal feelings and the situation between the two friends. The author was close, but they've drifted apart. The friend chose others for the wedding party, which the author isn't in. The author is hurt and is evaluating whether attending is worth the effort and emotional toll.\n\nThe key points here are: the friendship's history, the author's exclusion from the wedding party, their feelings, and the decision to attend. The author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided relationship and are cutting contact. Not attending the wedding could be seen as a way to enforce boundaries, which is understandable. However, culturally, there's an expectation to attend a close friend's wedding regardless of being in the party.\n\nBut the author's feelings are valid. They felt slighted and were surprised by the exclusion. The friend didn't ask them first, which might have been a mistake. The author is not obligated to attend, but there could be social expectations. However, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, the author's decision to not attend and distance themselves isn't necessarily wrong. It's about personal boundaries and self-respect.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing social expectations with the author's emotional well-being. Since the author is prioritizing their own feelings and setting boundaries, it's not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
