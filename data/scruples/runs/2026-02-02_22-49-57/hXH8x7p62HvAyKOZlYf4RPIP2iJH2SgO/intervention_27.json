I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. They've been friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But now, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and the person feels hurt. They're considering skipping the wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around attending weddings. Generally, people attend weddings of close friends regardless of whether they're part of the wedding party. But the author is questioning if it's wrong to not go. The key points here are the friendship's history, the hurt feelings, and the author's decision to cut ties.\n\nThe author wasn't in the wedding party, which might make them feel less included. But is it their responsibility to attend just because they're friends? Some might say yes, as weddings are important events. Others might say it's understandable if they're hurt and don't want to attend. The author also mentions wanting to focus on friends who value their presence, so maybe they're justified in moving on.\n\nThe friend didn't tell the author first, which adds to the hurt. Maybe the friend didn't consider the author's feelings, but that's on the friend. The author's decision not to attend might stem from feeling undervalued. It's a personal choice, and whether it's right or wrong depends on cultural norms and the individuals involved. \n\nIn many cases, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, but if the friendship has drifted, the author might feel it's time to let go. The fact that they're not attending could be a way to set boundaries, which isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
