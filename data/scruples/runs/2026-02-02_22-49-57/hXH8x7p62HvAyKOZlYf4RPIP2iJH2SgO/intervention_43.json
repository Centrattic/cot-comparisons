I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and their friend have been friends for over 15 years. When the friend got engaged, the author thought she would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The author was hurt but understood they had drifted. Even so, the author expected to be a bridesmaid. Then they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included at all.\n\nNow, the author is considering not attending because they feel embarrassed and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They mention it's a few states away, which would require some expense and time off, but not a major hardship. The author also says they don't plan to stay in contact after this.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. Let me think about social norms here. Weddings are big events, and friends are usually expected to attend, especially long-term friends. However, the author wasn't included in the wedding party, which might be a big deal. Not being in the wedding party can be hurtful, and maybe the author feels slighted. \n\nBut is it fair for the author to not attend because they weren't in the wedding party? On one hand, the friend's decision to include others might be her right, as it's her wedding. On the other hand, the author was expecting to be included given their history. However, the author is choosing to not attend, which could be seen as cutting off the friendship, but maybe they feel it's justified if they don't want a one-sided relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they aren't in the wedding party, attending would be awkward and not worth the effort. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact. So maybe they're prioritizing their own feelings here. But in many social circles, attending a friend's wedding is considered important regardless of being in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe the author is being realistic.\n\nI need to balance the expectations. The friend didn't reach out to the author first about the wedding, which might be a red flag. The author was surprised by the Facebook post. The friend didn't inform the author personally, which could indicate a lack of consideration. So maybe the friend was already distant, and the author is just acknowledging that. \n\nIn that case, the author's decision not to attend might be a way to set boundaries. They're not obligated to attend just because they were once close friends. The expense and time are factors too. So maybe the author isn't wrong for making that choice. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is a courtesy, regardless of being in the wedding party. But if the friendship is already strained, the author could be protecting their own feelings. \n\nSo weighing all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the friend's lack of communication, the drifting relationship, and the author's decision to prioritize their own comfort.\n"
