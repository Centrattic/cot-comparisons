I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to a wedding and considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has known each other for 15 years. The writer thought they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But now, the friend chose someone else. The writer is hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and feel it's not worth the effort and cost. They also don't want to continue the friendship after this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The answer should be based on common social norms and understanding of friendship.\n\nSo, weddings are usually attended by close friends and family even if they're not in the wedding party. Not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend completely, which could be hurtful. The writer mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship, which could be a valid reason to distance. However, not attending a close friend's wedding might be seen as extreme. The friend wasn't invited to the wedding party, which might sting, but attending could still be a way to show support despite being hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer has the right to prioritize their time and money. If they feel the friendship isn't reciprocal, walking away might be justified. But socially, attending a wedding is often expected unless there's a valid reason (like illness or travel issues). The cost isn't prohibitive for them, so maybe they should attend for the sake of the friendship. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The writer's feelings are valid, but maybe not attending is cutting off the friendship entirely. However, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe it's not one-sided. The answer hinges on social expectations versus personal feelings. In many cases, attending a close friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. So, the writer might be in the wrong for not attending. But if they genuinely feel the friendship isn't worth it anymore, maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards AITA being \"No,\" meaning the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to their feelings and choices. But I'm a bit conflicted because social norms suggest attending. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the decision is personal and they have the right to choose not to attend if they're uncomfortable.\n"
