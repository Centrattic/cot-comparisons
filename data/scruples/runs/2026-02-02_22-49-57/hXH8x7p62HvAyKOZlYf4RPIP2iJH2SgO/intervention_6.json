I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering not attending her friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known each other for 15 years. The author assumed she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at her wedding. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend. The author feels hurt and then sees others in the wedding party who aren't close. She's considering not attending because she's not part of the wedding party and feels the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nI should consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, especially if you've been friends for 15 years. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing support is common. But the author feels slighted and wants to distance herself. \n\nThe friend didn't inform her about the wedding until Facebook, which is a red flag. The author did reach out and talk about the plans, so maybe the friend was avoiding the topic. The author's decision not to attend is based on hurt feelings and wanting to focus on mutual friends. \n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? Attending is a personal choice. If the author feels she's being treated unfairly, she has the right to decide not to go. However, some might argue that weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about personal validation. The author's reasoning is understandable, but some might see it as cutting off the friend completely, which could be harsh.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions might have been careless. Not informing the author directly about the wedding and not including her in the wedding party could be seen as a breach of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt. Her decision not to attend is a personal choice based on her feelings. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers the balance of actions. The friend's failure to communicate and include the author, combined with the author's feelings of being undervalued, might tip the scales in her favor. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
