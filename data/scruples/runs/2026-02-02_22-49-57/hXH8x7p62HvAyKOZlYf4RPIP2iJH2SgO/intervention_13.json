I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a friend who's getting married, and the author expected to be in the wedding party, maybe even maid of honor. But the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt and now considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might have already been a red flag. The friend didn't reach out first, which could indicate some drifting apart. The author tried to talk about wedding plans after congratulating, which seems normal. Then, the friend selected another childhood friend as maid of honor, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. \n\nThe author is thinking about not attending because of the cost and time, but also because they feel slighted. They mention wanting to focus on friends who value them. The question is whether not attending is justified. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are personal, and the bride gets to choose her wedding party. Not being in the party doesn't necessarily mean the friend doesn't value the relationship. However, the author's feelings are hurt because of the lack of communication and the selection of others. \n\nBut does the author have a right to expect an invitation to the wedding itself? Typically, yes, unless there's a reason not to invite someone. However, the author is choosing not to attend because they aren't in the party. Is that inconsiderate? Well, the author is prioritizing their own feelings and resources. They're not forcing the friend to include them. \n\nThe key points are the prior relationship, the friend's actions (not informing first, choosing others), and the author's decision to not attend. The author's reasoning is about mutual respect and not wanting a one-sided friendship. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on feeling undervalued, even if that's not entirely the friend's fault. The friend may have her reasons, but the author has the right to decide how to spend their time and money. So, answer B.\n"
