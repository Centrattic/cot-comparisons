I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend has been a long-time friend, over 15 years. The author expected to be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author feels hurt. Now, the author is considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the friendship dynamics. The author assumed a role due to their previous relationship, but the friend made different choices. The author is feeling slighted and wants to cut ties, hence not attending the wedding.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is usually a choice, not an obligation. The author is making a decision based on their feelings. They might feel it's a one-sided friendship now, especially since the friend didn't inform them first and included others they aren't close with. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHowever, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding, despite personal hurt, is a sign of respect for the friendship. But the author is prioritizing their own emotions and boundaries. They might feel that their friend didn't value their relationship as much as they thought, so not attending is a way to set a boundary.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their feelings and choosing their own well-being. They're not obligated to attend if it causes them pain. The friend's actions led to the author's decision, so the fault isn't entirely on the author. Answer B.\n"
