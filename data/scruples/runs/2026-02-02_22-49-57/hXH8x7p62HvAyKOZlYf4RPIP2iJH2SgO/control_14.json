I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because they weren't asked as a bridesmaid in their friend's wedding. They were surprised when they found out via Facebook, which already suggests a possible communication issue. The friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago, so the author expected the same in return. However, the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and then the author realized they weren't even in the wedding party.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to attend the wedding because they aren't in the wedding party. The author is considering the costs (plane ticket, hotel, time off) and feels it's not worth it, especially since they're hurt and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this. Wedding etiquette usually says that close friends are expected to attend, regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is hurt and feels ignored, which makes emotional sense. The friend didn't inform them first and didn't include them in the wedding party. The author's decision not to attend is partly about saving money and time, but also about their feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend might expect the author to attend, but the author has valid reasons to feel hurt. The fact that the author isn't in the wedding party isn't their fault. Attending a wedding is a personal choice. If the author feels that the friendship has become one-sided and they don't want to continue, that's their decision. They might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that showing up would be a kind gesture despite being hurt. However, the author's reasoning is understandable. The answer might be B, No.\n"
