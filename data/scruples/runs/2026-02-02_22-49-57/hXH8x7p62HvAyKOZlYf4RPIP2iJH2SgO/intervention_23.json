I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend. They thought they'd be maid of honor since their friend was maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend. The author felt hurt but understood they'd drifted apart. Now, they're not in the wedding party at all. The author is considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the effort and they're upset about not being included. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut contact after.\n\nThe key points here are the friendship's history, the author's expectations vs reality, and their decision to not attend. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. \n\nI should consider social norms. Typically, attending a long-term friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But the author is hurt and feels slighted. They also mention the cost and time involved, which might be a factor. The author's decision is based on their feelings and not wanting to invest in a one-sided relationship. \n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize their feelings? The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is a significant snub. The author might feel that attending would be pretending everything is fine when it's not. Also, the friend didn't inform them personally, which is another point of hurt. \n\nHowever, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and guests are invited regardless of being in the party. The author might be using this as a way to distance, which could be fair if they're already planning to cut contact. \n\nI think the author has valid feelings. They were a prior maid of honor, so their expectations were reasonable. The friend's actions (not informing them, choosing others) contributed to the hurt. The decision not to attend is a personal choice based on their emotional response. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
