I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend who was surprised by the wedding announcement on Facebook. They thought they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Then they found out the role went to someone else. The author assumed they'd still be a bridesmaid, but later realized they weren't part of the wedding party at all.\n\nThe author is hurt but understands it's the friend's day. They're considering not attending because they're embarrassed and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore. They mention it's not a major hardship to attend, but it's not worth it to them. They also plan to cut ties after this.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong to skip the wedding. Weddings are personal, and guests are usually invited based on the couple's wishes. The author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party, but that doesn't automatically mean they won't be invited. However, the author is choosing not to attend because of the hurt feelings and not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nIn many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important because it's a significant event. But if the friend didn't invite them, maybe there's a reason. However, in this case, the author might still be invited as a guest. But they're planning to not attend regardless, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut the author is also setting boundaries. They're saying they don't want to maintain a relationship where they're not valued. If the friend didn't tell them first and excluded them from the wedding party, maybe the friendship has already shifted. The author's decision could be a way to move on.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their feelings and are making a choice to prioritize their own feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
