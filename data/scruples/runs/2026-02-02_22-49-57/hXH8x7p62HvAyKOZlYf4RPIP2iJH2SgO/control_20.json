I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the author was surprised they weren't told about the wedding first. They had a long friendship of 15 years, so maybe they expected a more personal announcement. They were also the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago, so it's natural to assume they'd be in the wedding party again. But the friend chose another childhood best friend for the maid of honor and didn't include them in the wedding party. The author feels hurt but understands it's the bride's choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether it's wrong to not attend. The author is considering the costs\u2014plane ticket, hotel, time off work. They don't see it as a major hardship but don't think it's worth it. Also, they mention the friendship has become one-sided and they don't plan to stay in contact after the wedding.\n\nHmm. Attending a wedding is a personal choice. While it's usually expected to attend if you're close, the author is choosing not to go because they're not in the wedding party. They might feel it's an insult or a sign of being replaced. But is that a valid reason? Weddings aren't always about including everyone; the bride picks her closest friends. The author could still attend as a regular guest. However, they might feel uncomfortable at a wedding where they aren't part of the party, especially if they were expecting to be. \n\nAlso, not attending might hurt the friend, but the author is already distancing themselves. They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship, so maybe they're just trying to cut ties. In that case, not attending could be a way to say goodbye. \n\nI think the key points are: The author is hurt but acknowledges the bride's right to choose. The decision not to attend is due to personal feelings and practical considerations. Whether they're in the wrong depends on cultural expectations and the nature of the friendship. Since the author isn't forcing the friend to include them and is making a choice based on their own feelings, they might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that attending out of respect is expected. However, the user's options are A or B. Given the reasoning, the answer would be B (No), they are not in the wrong.\n"
