I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. The situation is that they've been friends for 15 years, the friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, but now the friend has chosen someone else as maid of honor. The author found out via Facebook and later realized they aren't in the wedding party at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around attending weddings. Generally, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is expected, especially for a close friend. But the author is hurt and feels it's not worth the effort. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a point of hurt. The author is considering not attending to avoid embarrassment and feels the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The friend didn't inform the author first, which is a breach of etiquette. 2) The author is hurt because they expected a role in the wedding party. 3) The author is choosing not to attend, which might be seen as cutting off the friend, but they feel the friendship has drifted.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. Attending a wedding is typically a social obligation, but if the friendship is strained, maybe not attending is acceptable. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and future interactions. The friend's choice not to include them in the wedding party is a significant factor here. The author isn't being malicious; they're reacting to being excluded. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they have valid reasons for their decision based on the situation.\n"
