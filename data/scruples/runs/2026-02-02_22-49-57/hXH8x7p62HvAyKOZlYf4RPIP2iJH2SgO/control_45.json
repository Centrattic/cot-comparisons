I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and the friend have been close for 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was surprising because they expected to be told first. They were also expecting to be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But later, the friend chose someone else for maid of honor, and the author realized they weren't even in the wedding party.\n\nThe author is hurt but acknowledges that it's the friend's day. However, they're considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the effort and cost. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them and not engage in a one-sided relationship.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as cutting off a friend. On the other hand, the author feels hurt and unappreciated, and the friend hasn't communicated well. The friend didn't inform them first and didn't include them in the wedding party despite their history. The author's decision might be a reaction to feeling undervalued. \n\nBut is it wrong to prioritize their own feelings? The author isn't being mean; they're processing their hurt and deciding to move on. The friend's actions might have contributed to the drift. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their own emotional well-being after being excluded. However, some might argue that attending is a sign of respect regardless. But given the circumstances of being excluded and the drift, B seems plausible.\n"
