I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. They were really close friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Now the friend has chosen someone else as the maid of honor, and even some people they haven't been close with. The author feels hurt but understands the friend might have drifted apart. They're considering not going to the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, first, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially a long-time friend. But the author is hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party, which is a big deal. They were expecting to be the maid of honor since they returned the favor. The friend didn't tell them first, which adds to the hurt. \n\nBut the author is choosing not to attend because they feel slighted. Is that wrong? Well, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as a big snub. However, the author is making a personal choice based on their feelings. They might feel that their friend doesn't value their friendship anymore, so they're cutting contact. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should attend regardless because it's a major life event. But the author is also prioritizing their own feelings and setting boundaries. The friend might not realize how hurt the author is, but the author is taking it personally. \n\nI think the key points are: the author was hurt, but they're making a choice based on their own feelings. They're not attending because they feel unappreciated. Whether that's wrong depends on perspective. Some might say attending is important for the friendship, others might support the author's decision to protect their own feelings. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether attending is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. If the author's reason is valid (feeling unappreciated), then maybe not wrong. But if not attending is seen as hurtful, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is prioritizing their feelings and the situation seems to have caused a rift. The friend didn't communicate well, and the author is making a choice based on their own comfort. It's not necessarily wrong to not attend if they feel it's one-sided.\n"
