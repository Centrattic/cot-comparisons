I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-time friend getting married, and the author isn't in the wedding party. They found out via Facebook, which they were surprised by since they thought they'd be told first. They were expecting to be the maid of honor, especially since they returned the favor two years ago. When they saw the other friend was chosen, they were hurt but understood the drift. Now they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and feel it's a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, attending a friend's wedding is a big deal, even if you're not part of the bridal party. But the author has valid reasons: they're hurt, the friend didn't inform them first, and they feel their friendship has drifted. They also mention they won't stay in contact after, which might add to their feelings of being overlooked.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since they're not in the wedding party, attending feels like a one-sided effort. They might feel it's not worth the expense and time if the friend hasn't valued them enough to be part of the close group this time. But on the other hand, weddings are significant events where you generally go to support the friend regardless of being in the party. Maybe the friend thought it's her day to choose, and the author's decision to not attend could be seen as cutting ties over something that's not entirely the friend's fault.\n\nBut the friend didn't even inform them first, which is a big red flag. Normally, you'd tell your best friend in person before posting it publicly. That could be a point where the friend was wrong, making the author's reaction more understandable. The author's hurt feelings are justified, and maybe they feel unappreciated. Choosing not to attend because of that might be a way to express that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore. \n\nHowever, some might argue that attending the wedding is about being there for the friend, regardless of being in the party. But the author is making it clear they won't stay in contact, so maybe they're ending the friendship, and not attending is part of that decision. In that case, it's their choice to end the relationship, and they aren't in the wrong for not attending if they don't want to continue the friendship. \n\nSo considering all points: the friend didn't inform them first, didn't include them in the bridal party despite being a 15-year friend, and the author is ending the friendship. The author's decision to not attend might be justified as a way to cut ties, especially since they're not in the party. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
