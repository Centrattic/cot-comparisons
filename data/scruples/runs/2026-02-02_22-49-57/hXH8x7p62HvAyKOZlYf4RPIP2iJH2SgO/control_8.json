I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer is a 15-year friend who was surprised the friend didn't tell them first. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The writer is hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional hurt and the decision to not attend a significant event due to feeling slighted. Weddings are big events, and attending is often expected, but it's not a legal obligation. The writer is making a choice based on their feelings, which is personal. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't necessarily do anything wrong by choosing others. People can drift apart, and the friend might have chosen others for her own reasons. The writer's decision to not attend is their choice, but does that make them wrong? It depends on cultural or personal expectations, but in many cases, attending a wedding is a gesture of support, not a requirement. \n\nThe writer mentions it's not a major hardship, but they don't feel it's worth it. They also plan to cut off contact. That's their choice, but maybe they should consider the friendship's history. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The writer isn't obligated to attend, so they might not be in the wrong. But maybe they should reflect on their own feelings and the friendship's state. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about personal choice. The answer here is likely B (No), because attending a wedding isn't required, and the writer is prioritizing their own feelings and the health of the friendship. They're not in the wrong for making that choice.\n"
