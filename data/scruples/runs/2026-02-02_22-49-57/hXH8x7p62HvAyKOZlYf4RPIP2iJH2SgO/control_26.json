I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they aren't a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been friends for over 15 years, but the writer found out about the wedding on Facebook. They thought they would be the maid of honor, especially since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The writer is hurt but understands the drift. Now, the writer is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's a significant expense and time commitment.\n\nThe key points here are the length of the friendship, the prior role in the friend's wedding, and the current feelings of being excluded. The writer is feeling slighted but is questioning if they're right to skip the wedding. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are major events, and friends are usually expected to attend. However, if there's a falling out or significant hurt feelings, maybe it's acceptable. But in this case, the writer mentions they still want to attend but are conflicted because they're not in the wedding party. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to stop contact.\n\nThe original friend didn't inform them first, which could be a point. Also, the writer was expecting to be a maid of honor but wasn't, which might be a valid hurt feeling. However, skipping the wedding might be seen as cutting off contact, which could be harsh.\n\nBut in terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether attending is expected despite not being in the wedding party. Socially, attending is usually expected unless there's a major reason not to. The author's reasoning is that they're hurt and not in the wedding party, but that might not be a valid reason to skip. The author could still attend to support the friend, even if they feel slighted.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they're choosing not to attend a friend's wedding out of hurt feelings, which could be seen as selfish. However, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's a valid decision. The writer says they don't want a one-sided friendship, so maybe they're justified in ending it. But attending the wedding is separate from being in the wedding party. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they have a right to their feelings and can choose to attend or not based on their comfort and the current state of the friendship.\n\nWait, but the core of the question is whether they are in the wrong for not attending. If the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is a common occurrence and not a personal slight, then not attending might be seen as overreacting. However, the initial friend's action of finding out on Facebook instead of being told first adds to the hurt. The writer might feel disrespected, which could justify their decision. So maybe B is the answer here because the writer isn't in the wrong for making a choice based on their feelings and the friendship's status.\n"
