I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user is a friend of someone who's getting married. They've known this friend for over 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at the user's wedding. Now, the user found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor but later realized they weren't even in the wedding party. The user is now considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Usually, close friends are invited, and being in the wedding party is a big honor. But the user wasn't asked, which could be hurtful. The friend did reach out after the user congratulated them, but maybe that was just polite. The user feels slighted because they expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated by having the friend as maid of honor.\n\nThe user is questioning whether it's wrong to not attend the wedding. The main points here are the friendship, the expectation of being in the wedding party, and the decision to not attend. The user is also considering cutting off contact after the wedding. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation, especially for someone close. But if the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the user feels it's a sign of the friendship not being as close as they thought. The user might be hurt and want to distance themselves. \n\nBut maybe the friend had other reasons for choosing the wedding party. They might have drifted apart, as the user mentioned. The user is making a choice based on their feelings of not being valued. However, not attending could be seen as cutting ties without giving the friend a chance to explain. But the user does say they planned to attend anyway, just without being in the party. However, they found out later the friend included others who aren't close anymore. \n\nThe user is deciding that attending isn't worth the emotional toll. They're choosing to focus on more mutual friendships. So, is the user in the wrong? If the friend didn't ask them to be in the party, maybe they have valid reasons. But the user's feelings are justified. The decision to not attend is a personal choice based on the friendship dynamics. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The user isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt and choosing to not attend, especially if they feel the friendship is one-sided. So the answer is probably B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
