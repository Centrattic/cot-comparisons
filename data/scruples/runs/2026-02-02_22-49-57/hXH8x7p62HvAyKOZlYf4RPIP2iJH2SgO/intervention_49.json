I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't inform the author about the wedding first, which the author expected. That's a red flag because usually, close friends tell each other about major life events. Then, the author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author felt hurt but tried to understand the drift in their relationship. However, when the author realized they weren't even a bridesmaid, they decided not to attend the wedding because they felt embarrassed and didn't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nNow, the key points here are expectations and the nature of the friendship. The author had a long-standing friendship of 15 years, which suggests a deep connection. The friend's failure to inform them first and not including them in the wedding party might have been a significant letdown. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as a reaction to feeling undervalued. However, weddings are important events, and attending is often considered a sign of support, even if you're not part of the wedding party.\n\nBut then, the author's reasoning is about mutual respect and valuing friendships that are reciprocal. They feel the friendship has become one-sided, which is a valid concern. The cost of attending isn't prohibitive, but the emotional cost of being embarrassed might outweigh the financial aspect. The author isn't holding a grudge but is choosing to focus on friendships that are more balanced.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is typically expected, especially for long-term friends, regardless of being in the wedding party. However, the author is making a conscious choice to not invest in a relationship that they feel has become one-sided. That decision is personal. Whether it's right or wrong can depend on cultural expectations and personal values. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the friend values the friendship enough that attending the wedding is a priority. But if the author believes the friendship is deteriorating and they want to move on, their decision is understandable. It's a balance between social expectations and personal feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their feelings of being undervalued and choosing to prioritize reciprocal relationships.\n"
