I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The author has been friends with their friend for 15 years, and even though they thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was in their wedding, they weren't even in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Typically, weddings are big events, and attending is a significant gesture. But the author is hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party, which might be a big deal for them. They feel it's a one-sided friendship now and want to focus on friends who value them.\n\nThe key points are: the friend didn't inform the author first, didn't include them in the wedding party, and the author is deciding whether to attend despite the cost and effort. The author's reasoning is that since they aren't in the wedding party, attending doesn't seem worth it, and they don't want to maintain a one-sided friendship.\n\nI should think about whether not attending is a reasonable response. The author isn't being hostile; they're making a personal choice based on their feelings. The friend might feel hurt if they don't come, but the author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being. It's a tough spot, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're responding to their friend's actions, which were hurtful. The answer would probably be B (No), because attending a wedding when you're not in the party isn't mandatory, and the author is choosing their own happiness.\n"
