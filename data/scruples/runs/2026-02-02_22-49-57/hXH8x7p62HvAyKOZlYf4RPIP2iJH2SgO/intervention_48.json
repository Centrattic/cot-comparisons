I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they're not a bridesmaid. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend of the bride. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the bride chose someone else. The writer isn't in the wedding party at all now. They're hurt but understand it's the bride's choice. However, they're considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the expense and effort, especially since they're not in the wedding party. They also mention they're not interested in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the writer is hurt, they're not attending, and they're cutting off contact. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to assess if not attending is a reasonable response. Weddings are about the couple, so the bride gets to choose her attendants. The writer isn't obligated to attend, especially if it's a financial burden and they feel unappreciated. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, but maybe they still want to go for the sake of the friendship. However, the writer is making a choice based on their feelings and the effort required. It's a personal decision. The writer isn't being cruel or cutting contact in a mean way; they're just ending the friendship because they feel it's one-sided now. That seems like a valid choice.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding, regardless of being in the party, is a sign of support. But the writer is hurt and feels their friendship isn't valued. They're not attending to spite but because they don't feel included. The answer might hinge on whether the writer is overreacting. But given the context, the writer has a right to feel hurt and to prioritize their own emotional well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The writer isn't obligated to attend, and their decision is based on their feelings and the state of the friendship.\n"
