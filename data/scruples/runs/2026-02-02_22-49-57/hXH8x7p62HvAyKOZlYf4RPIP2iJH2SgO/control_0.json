I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending her friend's wedding after not being included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been friends with this person for 15 years. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which probably hurt because she expected to be told directly. She assumed she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was her maid of honor at her wedding. But then she found out the friend chose someone else, a childhood friend they'd drifted apart from. The author still expected to be a bridesmaid, but then realized she's not in the wedding party at all. Now she's considering not attending the wedding because it's costly and she feels embarrassed. She doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend didn't include her in the wedding party, the author feels hurt and maybe slighted, and she's deciding whether not attending is justified. The question is whether she's in the wrong by choosing not to attend.\n\nTraditionally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important because it's a big life event. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is a way to support them. But the author feels that since she's not part of the wedding party, it's not worth the effort and cost. She also mentions wanting to focus on friends who value her presence.\n\nI need to weigh the social expectations against the personal feelings. The friend didn't include her in the bridal party, which is a big deal. But maybe the author should attend out of respect, even if it's painful. On the other hand, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe she's justified in not attending. The fact that she's not staying in contact after this suggests she feels the friendship isn't mutual anymore.\n\nSome people might argue that not attending could be seen as a snub, especially if the friend didn't explain why she wasn't included in the wedding party. Others might say the author has every right to prioritize her feelings and time. The cost isn't huge, but it's a factor. However, the emotional aspect is significant here.\n\nI think the key is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Social norms usually expect attendance, but if the friendship is deteriorating, maybe not. The friend might have hurt her feelings by not including her, which the author is acknowledging. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But I'm a bit conflicted. Some might say attending is expected, even if you're not in the party. Others would support her decision to not attend if she's not part of the close group anymore.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because she's making a personal choice based on her feelings and the state of the friendship. She's also acknowledging that it's her friend's day, but she's prioritizing her own well-being and the value of the friendship.\n"
