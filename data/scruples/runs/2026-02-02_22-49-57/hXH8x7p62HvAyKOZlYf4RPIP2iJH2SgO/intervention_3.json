I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have a friend who's getting married, but the friend didn't include them in the wedding party. The author feels hurt because they thought they'd be the maid of honor, given that they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and then the author realized they're not even in the wedding party at all.\n\nThe author is now considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the bridal party. They mention that the friend didn't inform them about the wedding first, which is a point of hurt. They also feel like the friendship has drifted, which might contribute to their decision.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to attend. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, attending a wedding is traditionally considered a nice gesture, especially for a long-time friend. But it's not a legal obligation. The author is hurt and feels slighted, which is understandable. Being excluded from the wedding party can be a blow, especially if there was an unspoken expectation based on past roles.\n\nThe friend didn't communicate the plans directly, which could have caused confusion or hurt feelings. The author did reach out to congratulate, so they tried to maintain the friendship. The decision to not attend might be seen as a way to set boundaries, especially since the author feels the friendship is becoming one-sided. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending is a kind thing to do regardless, even if you're not in the bridal party. Weddings can be expensive, but the author mentions it's not a major hardship, so that's a factor. \n\nBut the core issue is the friendship dynamics. If the author feels the friend isn't valuing their relationship as they once did, then choosing not to attend could be a way to protect their own feelings. The author isn't being spiteful; they're not planning to cut off contact entirely but are focusing on maintaining relationships that are more reciprocal.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's failure to communicate directly, the drifting apart, and the author's feelings of being unappreciated. The author's decision is more about self-respect than being petty. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about the friend's actions leading to the author's hurt, not the author's choice not to attend. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
