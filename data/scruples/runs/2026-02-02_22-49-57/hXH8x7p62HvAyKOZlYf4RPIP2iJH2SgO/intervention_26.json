I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was friends with the bride for over 15 years. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the bride was their maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. But the bride chose someone else, a childhood friend, as her maid of honor. Then the author realized they weren't even in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands it's the bride's choice. However, they don't want to attend the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, and they're considering not attending due to the cost and effort involved, plus feeling like the friendship has become one-sided.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author feels slighted by not being asked to be a bridesmaid, which is a common source of hurt in friendships. The bride didn't inform the author first, which might be another issue. The author is considering skipping the wedding, which can be a sensitive decision because weddings are big events, and not attending might be seen as rude or hurtful. But the author is also reflecting on the drifting relationship and not wanting to invest in a one-sided friendship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is generally considered important, even if you're not in the wedding party. People often go to weddings of close friends regardless of their role. However, if the friendship has become distant, maybe the author feels justified in not attending. But there's a balance between personal feelings and social expectations.\n\nThe bride might have her reasons for not choosing the author as a bridesmaid, maybe due to wanting closer current friends or others who live nearby for the wedding party. The author's hurt is valid, but choosing not to attend a wedding is a big decision. However, the author is also acknowledging the cost and the fact that they're not in the wedding party, which is a personal decision.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is unreasonable. Some might say that attending a friend's wedding is a basic courtesy, especially after 15 years of friendship, regardless of being in the wedding party. Others might see it as the author's right to make that choice, especially if they feel the friendship has become one-sided.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often considers intent and context. The author isn't being malicious; they're hurt and feeling unappreciated. They're making a decision based on their own feelings and circumstances. However, the action of not attending might be seen as a bit harsh, but given the circumstances, it's understandable.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not attending because of hurt feelings, some might say they're being petty or not supporting their friend. However, if they're making a choice to not invest in a one-sided relationship, others might support that. The author is not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their own feelings after a long friendship that seems to have drifted.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for their feelings and decision, even if it's a difficult one to make.\n"
