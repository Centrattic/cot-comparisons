I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for considering not attending her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is getting married after 15 years of friendship. The author was surprised by the Facebook announcement, expecting to be told first. She assumed she would be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But then she found out her friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and the author realized she wasn't in the wedding party at all. Now she's considering not attending because it's a hassle and she's hurt.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the friendship dynamics. The author felt slighted because she wasn't in the wedding party. But the friend might have drifted apart, as mentioned. The author is thinking about not attending to avoid embarrassment and to focus on friends who value her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. While some might argue that attending is a sign of support, others might say that if the friendship has changed, it's okay to prioritize one's feelings. The author isn't cutting off the friend entirely but is planning to discontinue contact afterward. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being upset about not being in the wedding party is understandable, but deciding not to attend because of it could be seen as a response to feeling undervalued. However, weddings are about the couple, so the friend's choice of wedding party is her right. The author's decision to not attend might be seen as justified given the circumstances, especially if she's not part of the wedding party. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of attending as a friend regardless of the role. Some people might expect you to attend out of respect, even if you're not in the party. However, the author is in a different state, so there are logistical and financial considerations. She's not refusing out of spite but because she doesn't want to put herself through the effort if she's not part of the party.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's making a choice based on her feelings and the situation. The friend didn't include her in the wedding party, which hurt her, and attending might feel like a one-sided effort. The answer would be B (No).\n"
