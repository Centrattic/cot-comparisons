I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend's wedding. The author is a 15-year friend, and she found out about the wedding on Facebook, which hurt. She expected to be the maid of honor since she was the maid of honor in her friend's wedding two years ago. But now she's not in the wedding party at all. The friend has chosen someone else as the maid of honor and even included people who haven't been close lately. The author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party and feels it's not worth the expense and effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend didn't tell her first, which is a bit of a red flag. The author probably felt slighted. But the friend is within her rights to choose her wedding party as she sees fit. The author's expectation of being maid of honor might have been based on their past friendship, but relationships can change. The friend might have drifted away, and the author noticed that too.\n\nNow, the author is deciding whether to attend the wedding. The question is if she's in the wrong for not attending. The author feels hurt and embarrassed, and she's not in the wedding party. She's planning to cut ties, so maybe she's done with the friendship anyway. \n\nAttending a wedding is usually a social expectation, but it's not a legal obligation. People do choose not to attend weddings for various reasons. The author is justifying her decision by saying it's not worth the cost and effort, and she doesn't want a one-sided friendship. Her reasoning is that she wants to focus on friends who value her presence. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, not necessarily. She's making a personal choice based on her feelings and the current state of the friendship. She's not being malicious; she's hurt and wants to honor herself. However, it's possible that attending the wedding might help mend the friendship or show support despite the hurt. But if she's planning to cut ties anyway, maybe it's a way to save face and avoid awkwardness. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that attending a friend's wedding is important regardless of being in the party. But if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's not worth it. The author's decision seems to be based on self-respect and moving on from a drifting friendship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that prioritizes her own feelings and the reality of the friendship's current status.\n"
