I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might be a point of hurt. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding. But then the friend chose someone else. The author felt hurt but tried to understand the drift in the relationship. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and are thinking of cutting ties.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not attending. The key points here are the expectations and the reasons behind not attending. The author is hurt because they weren't in the wedding party and feel the friendship is one-sided. Not attending is a personal choice, especially given the distance and cost involved. \n\nFriendships can be complex. The author might feel that their efforts in the friendship aren't reciprocated, especially since the friend didn't inform them first. However, attending a wedding is a social norm, but it's not a requirement. The author's feelings are valid, and choosing to prioritize other relationships isn't wrong. The friend might feel slighted if the author doesn't attend, but the author has the right to make this decision based on their comfort and feelings. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their emotional state and the dynamics of the friendship. The answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
