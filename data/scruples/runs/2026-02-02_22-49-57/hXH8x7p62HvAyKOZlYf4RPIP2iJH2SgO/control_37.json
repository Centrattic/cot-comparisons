I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend situation: they've been friends for 15 years. The writer thought they'd be maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend. The writer was already concerned they might not be in the wedding party, but then realized the friend included other people who aren't close anymore. The writer feels hurt but understands it's the friend's decision. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and are planning to cut ties after this.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's consider social norms and expectations. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered important, especially for someone who has been close for so long. The wedding is a significant life event, and even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is usually expected. However, the author is making a choice based on their feelings of being slighted and not wanting to be in a one-sided relationship. \n\nBut is it wrong? Well, the friend didn't necessarily exclude them intentionally. The author was surprised not being told first, but that's on the friend. The author was hurt but tried to understand. Now, they're choosing not to attend, which could be seen as a reaction to the hurt feelings. However, attending is often seen as a gesture of support regardless of the wedding party status. Not attending might be hurtful to the friend, especially since the author was close. The friend might feel rejected if the author doesn't come. \n\nBut the other side is, the author is prioritizing their own feelings and setting boundaries. If the friendship has drifted and the author feels it's one-sided, maybe they're justified in making this choice. However, a wedding is a major event, and not attending could be a big snub. The author's reasoning hinges on the fact that they're not in the wedding party, but that's the friend's decision, and the author is using that as an excuse not to attend. \n\nIn AITA terms, the community often values showing up for important events even if you're not part of the wedding party. The friend's choice to include others is their right, but the writer's decision to exclude themselves from the wedding entirely might be seen as the problem. They're using the friend's decision as a reason not to attend, which could be seen as the wrong choice. The author might be overreacting, and the real issue is the drifting friendship rather than the wedding attendance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because not attending a close friend's wedding is generally frowned upon, especially if the decision is based on not being in the wedding party. The friend's choice isn't a valid reason to skip the event. The author should attend to maintain the friendship or at least try to reconcile, rather than cutting ties preemptively.\n"
