I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and the friend have been friends for over 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author assumed they would be the maid of honor at hers. But she ended up choosing another childhood friend. The author found out through Facebook, which might have added to the hurt because they thought they'd have been told in person first.\n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding. They mention it's not a major hardship but they don't want to attend if they're not in the wedding party. They also plan to cut ties after this. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Weddings are significant events, and attending is often expected even if you're not in the bridal party. However, the author feels hurt and might be prioritizing their own feelings here. But is it wrong to not attend? Well, it's their choice. They might feel it's one-sided, especially since there's been drifting apart. The friend didn't inform them first, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off contact, but the author says they don't want a one-sided friendship. Maybe they're justified in their decision. Also, the friend didn't include them in the bridal party, which could be a factor. \n\nBut culturally, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is customary. However, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and the state of the friendship. If the friendship has been drifting, perhaps the author isn't obligated to attend. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friendship seems to have changed, and attending might be more about formality than a genuine connection. Also, the friend didn't treat the author as a priority in the wedding planning, which is part of the reason for the decision.\n"
