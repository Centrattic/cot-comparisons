I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first and didn't ask them to be a bridesmaid. The author was surprised by the Facebook post. They had assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Then they found out another friend got the role, and even two other girls who aren't close. The author feels hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be part of a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the friend wrong the author? Well, the friend didn't exclude them intentionally, just chose others for the wedding party. The author is upset but acknowledges it's the friend's decision. The question is if not attending the wedding is wrong.\n\nTraditionally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not in the party. But the author is hurt and plans to cut ties. Is that justified? Maybe. The friend didn't reach out to the author, which might be a problem. But weddings are big events, and not attending might be seen as a big deal. However, the author's feelings are valid. They might feel disrespected. On the other hand, the friend might not have intended any harm.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, attending is expected, but if there's a falling out, it's understandable. The author isn't being unkind; they're prioritizing their own feelings. The friend didn't reach out, so maybe the author is protecting themselves. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to their feelings. So answer B.\n"
