I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is getting married, and the author is a 15-year friend. The author was surprised when they found out on Facebook, which already hints that the friend might not have made the author a priority. The author assumed they would be maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. Then, the friend chose someone else as maid of honor, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. \n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't asked to be part of the wedding party. They feel hurt and see it as a one-sided friendship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend.\n\nI should think about social norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is a big deal, but it's also a personal decision. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which might be a big emotional blow. The author is considering not attending to avoid embarrassment. \n\nIs there an obligation to attend even if you're not part of the wedding party? I think not. Weddings are about celebrating the couple's union, but guests are usually people the couple wants there. If the author wasn't part of the wedding party, maybe the friend didn't see them as a top priority. However, the friend might have had other reasons for not inviting them to the party, like logistical issues or personal choices. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship and would rather focus on friends who value them. That's a valid perspective. If the friendship has been drifting apart, maybe the author feels it's time to move on. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is a sign of support regardless of being in the party. But the author is hurt and not attending might be a way to express that. It's a personal choice. \n\nI need to check if there's any expectation in the friend's culture or if there's prior history. The story mentions they found out on Facebook, which could indicate some issues in communication. Also, the friend didn't ask the author to be a bridesmaid, so maybe they feel slighted. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not attending because attending a wedding when not part of the party isn't mandatory. The decision is based on their feelings and perception of the friendship. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
