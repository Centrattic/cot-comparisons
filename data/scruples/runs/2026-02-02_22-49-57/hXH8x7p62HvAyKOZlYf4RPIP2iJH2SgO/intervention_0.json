I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't invited to be a bridesmaid. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were best friends for 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which was a surprise. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But then, the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands the drift in their relationship over the years. Then, when checking Facebook, they realized they're not even in the wedding party at all. The author is considering not attending because it's a hassle and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore. They also plan to cut contact after this.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether not attending is wrong. Well, weddings are usually about the couple's day, and guests are generally invited, but the wedding party is a specific role. The author wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid, which might mean they weren't invited at all. But maybe they were just not in the party but still invited to the wedding.\n\nThe friend didn't inform them first, which is a point. But the author assumed they'd be in the wedding party, which might not be a given. The author is feeling slighted and wants to cut ties. So, if they were invited to the wedding, attending is expected, even if not in the party. But if they weren't invited, then not attending is understandable. The author's reasoning is that since they're not in the party, it's not worth the effort and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. The friend's actions (not telling them first, not including them) might be at fault here.\n\nBut from a social norm standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is usually expected regardless of being in the party. However, the author is feeling hurt and plans to move on. So, maybe they're not in the wrong because they were excluded from the wedding party and are prioritizing their own feelings. The friend's actions could be seen as the issue here. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
