I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend didn't inform the author about the wedding first. They found out on Facebook, which might be a point of hurt. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend, and later a few others who aren't as close.\n\nThe author feels hurt but understands the friendship has drifted. Now they're considering not attending the wedding since they're not part of the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship but they feel embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nI need to consider if attending is expected. Weddings are big events, and friends are usually invited. Not being in the wedding party doesn't mean you don't get to attend. The author might feel slighted, but refusing to attend could be seen as cutting off contact, especially if they were close before. However, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe this is a natural decline.\n\nBut the key here is the author's reasoning: they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They might feel the friendship isn't mutual anymore. Not attending could be a way to distance themselves. In that case, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're cutting off contact entirely without trying to talk it out, maybe there's a different angle. However, the friend didn't reach out to explain, just posted on Facebook. The author's decision might be a response to the friend's actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their feelings and the value they place on the friendship. Attending isn't mandatory unless there's a personal or family obligation. Since the author feels the friendship is one-sided, it's their right to prioritize their time and money elsewhere. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
