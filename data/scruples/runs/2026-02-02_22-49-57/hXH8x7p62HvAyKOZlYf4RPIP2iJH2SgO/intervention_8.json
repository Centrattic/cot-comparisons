I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known them for over 15 years and was the maid of honor at their wedding. The author was surprised when they found out via Facebook and then later realized they weren't in the wedding party. They feel hurt but understand it's the friend's day. Now they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the emotional response. The author expected to be a bridesmaid, maybe even the maid of honor, given their history. Not being included is hurtful. They're choosing not to attend, which is a personal decision. \n\nBut is this the author's fault? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. While there's a social expectation to attend, especially for a close friend, the author is justified in feeling hurt. They're not obligated to attend if they feel it's not worth the effort, especially if they're already planning to distance themselves from the friend. The friend didn't reach out, which could be part of the issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They're acting on their own feelings and priorities. The friend may have mismanaged expectations, but the decision to attend is the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
