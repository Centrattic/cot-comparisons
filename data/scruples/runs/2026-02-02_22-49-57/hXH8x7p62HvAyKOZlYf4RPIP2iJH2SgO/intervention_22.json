I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend of 15 years didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which is a bit strange. The author thought they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. Then, when the author saw the wedding party, they realized they weren't in it at all. Now, the author is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the reasons for not attending. The author felt they should have been included, but the friend made different choices. The author is hurt, which is understandable. Attending a wedding can be a big deal, especially if you're not in the wedding party. It might feel like an obligation, but in reality, attending is a choice. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and deciding that the effort isn't worth it given the current state of the friendship. \n\nThe friend didn't communicate well, maybe drifted apart, and chose others for the wedding party. The author isn't being unkind; they're making a decision based on their own emotional state and the direction they want their friendship to go. They also mention not staying in contact after, which shows they're processing the shift in the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not obligated to attend. They're making a personal choice based on how they feel. The friend's actions might have contributed to the author's decision. It's possible the author is protecting their own feelings. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
