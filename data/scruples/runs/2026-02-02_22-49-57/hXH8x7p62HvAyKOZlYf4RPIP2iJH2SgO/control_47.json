I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The person is a 15-year friend, but the friend found out via Facebook, which was a surprise. The friend was the maid of honor at their wedding, but now she's chosen someone else. The person is hurt but considering skipping the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the friendship duration, the initial surprise about the wedding announcement, the assumption of being a maid of honor, and the decision to not attend because they're not in the wedding party. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around weddings. Typically, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is expected, especially for close friends. But there are exceptions. The author is hurt because they weren't told first and wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. They feel the friendship has become one-sided, especially since they've drifted apart.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that attending would be a financial and time burden, and they don't want to put themselves in an uncomfortable situation. They also mention not planning to stay in contact after, which suggests they feel the friendship is ending. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, the friend didn't ask them to be in the wedding party. The author assumed they would be, but the friend made different choices. The author's decision not to attend because of that could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted. However, weddings are usually about celebrating the couple, so not attending might be seen as cutting off ties. But the author is also prioritizing their own feelings and time, which is understandable.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be in the wrong for not attending a friend's wedding without discussing it first. On the other, they're dealing with hurt feelings and a drifting friendship. The fact that they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding adds to the expectation. But the friend might have other reasons for the choices made, like personal preferences or family dynamics.\n\nIt's a bit nuanced. The author's intention is clear: they feel undervalued and don't want to invest in a one-sided relationship. But culturally, attending a friend's wedding is a big deal. However, the author's reasoning is valid\u2014they have a right to their feelings. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their feelings and circumstances.\n"
