I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author was a surprise when the friend posted about the engagement. The friend was the maid of honor at their wedding, so the author expected the same. Then, the friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor. The author was hurt but understood their drift. Now, the author found out that even as a bridesmaid, they weren't included. They feel it's not worth attending since they're not part of the wedding party, and they don't want to attend. They also plan to cut off contact.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Attending a friend's wedding is a common expectation, especially if you've been close. But not being in the wedding party might affect that. The author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided now. They're not attending, which could be seen as a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, some might argue that you attend for the friend's big day regardless of your role. \n\nThe key points: The friend didn't inform them first, which is a breach of etiquette. The author was hurt not being asked, which is valid. Deciding not to attend because they're not part of the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge or not valuing the friendship beyond their role. However, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing their own feelings and time.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often say that attending is important unless there are major issues. But here, the author's hurt feelings are valid. They might feel it's a one-sided friendship. So, depending on the community's perspective, the answer could vary. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to prioritize their feelings, especially if the friendship has been drifting. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a point against her. The author's decision is a personal choice to protect their own feelings, not just about the wedding party. So, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
