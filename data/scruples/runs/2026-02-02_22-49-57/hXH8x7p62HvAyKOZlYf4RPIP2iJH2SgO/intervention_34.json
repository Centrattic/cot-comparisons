I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with the bride for over 15 years. The bride didn't tell her about the wedding first, which was surprising. The author assumed she'd be the maid of honor because the bride was the maid of honor at her own wedding two years ago. But the bride chose another childhood friend for that role. The author thought she'd at least be a bridesmaid, but then found out she's not in the wedding party at all. The author is considering not attending the wedding because it's a hassle and they're feeling hurt and undervalued. They don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the decision not to attend. The author expected to be included, especially since they've been friends for so long. The bride didn't communicate the plans, which could be a point of contention. The author is now choosing not to attend, which is a personal decision based on their feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong to not attend? Well, weddings are typically expected to be attended by close friends, but it's the bride's choice who's in the wedding party. The author is hurt but also deciding that their time and money might not be worth it. The question is whether not attending is a valid reaction. \n\nSome might say the author is overreacting because the bride isn't obligated to include everyone, but others might see it as the author protecting their feelings. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer hinges on whether the author is being reasonable. Since they're choosing to honor their feelings and not attend, even though it's a close friend, it's their right. Plus, they already plan to distance from the friend, so attending might not be necessary. The answer is B.\n"
