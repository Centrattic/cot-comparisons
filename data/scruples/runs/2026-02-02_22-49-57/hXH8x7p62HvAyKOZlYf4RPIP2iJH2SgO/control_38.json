I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is that they've been friends for 15 years, the friend didn't tell them personally about the wedding, and they expected to be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. The friend ended up choosing someone else for the maid of honor, and the author isn't in the wedding party at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is being unreasonable. The friend didn't inform them directly, which was a hurt, but maybe they just forgot or assumed the author knew. Then the author assumed they'd be in the wedding party based on their previous role. However, the friend had different plans and included others who weren't as close. The author is deciding not to attend because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're close friends, people have different reasons for attending. The author might feel that not being in the wedding party invalidates their relationship. But maybe the friend still values them as a friend but just wanted different people in the wedding party. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as cutting ties, but if their friendship has drifted, maybe it's a way to move on. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's expectations vs. the friend's decisions. 2) The impact of not attending. 3) Whether the author is overreacting. \n\nIf the friend didn't communicate well, maybe that's her fault. But the author's reaction of not attending because they weren't in the wedding party might be a bit harsh. Weddings are the host's choice, and not being in the party doesn't necessarily mean the friend doesn't value them. However, the author's feelings are valid. They might be in the right to prioritize their own feelings, especially if the friendship has been drifting. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because attending is a personal choice, and the author is respecting their own feelings. The friend may have made poor choices in communication, but the author isn't obligated to attend if it's causing them distress.\n"
