I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend of 15 years didn't tell the author first and instead found out on Facebook. That's a red flag right there because usually, people tell their closest friends about a major life event first. Then, the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author felt hurt but tried to understand the drift. However, when they saw the wedding party list, they realized they weren't even a bridesmaid.\n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't in the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship but question the worth. They also plan to cut contact after this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Weddings are big events, and attending is often expected, especially for close friends. But the author has valid reasons. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is a significant role. Maybe the friend's actions showed they didn't value the author as a close friend anymore, given the drift and not being informed first. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and choosing to focus on mutual friendships. \n\nBut is it wrong not to attend? Well, it's the author's choice. They can decide to attend or not. The friend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, so the author's decision to not attend might be a way to protect their feelings. They're not obligated to attend just because of past friendship. However, some might argue that attending is a kindness despite the hurt. But the author is not being inconsiderate; they're processing their hurt and adjusting their friendship. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're making a personal choice based on their feelings and the friend's actions. The friend didn't act considerately, so the author's decision is understandable.\n"
