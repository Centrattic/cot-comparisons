I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year friend of the bride. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which upset her because she expected to be told first. She thought she'd be the maid of honor since she was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. But the bride chose another childhood friend instead. The author isn't in the wedding party at all now, and she's considering not attending because she's hurt and doesn't want to go to a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not attending the wedding is reasonable. The author is hurt, which is understandable. The bride didn't include her in the wedding party, which could be seen as a snub, especially given their long friendship. The author is not obligated to attend, right? Weddings are her choice. But maybe there's an expectation because of their friendship. However, the author mentions that they've drifted apart in recent years. If that's true, maybe the friendship isn't as close as it used to be, which might justify her decision.\n\nAlso, the author isn't going for the sake of being spiteful; she's hurt and wants to focus on friends who value her. She's not planning to stay in contact with the friend after this. That suggests she's moving on from a friendship that's become one-sided. \n\nBut is it wrong to skip the wedding? Some might argue that attending is important regardless of being in the wedding party, but others might say that if you're not part of the wedding party and the friendship has faded, it's okay to decline. The author is making a choice based on her feelings and the value she places on the friendship. The bride didn't reach out to explain or include her in the wedding party, which could be a factor. The author was surprised by the Facebook announcement, which isn't the best way to handle such news.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, I think she's making a personal choice that's respectful but reflects her current feelings. She's not being malicious; she's choosing to prioritize her own well-being and time. The bride might have a different perspective, but the author isn't obligated to attend. So I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
