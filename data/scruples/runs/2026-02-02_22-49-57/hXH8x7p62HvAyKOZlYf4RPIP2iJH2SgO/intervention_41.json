I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year friend of someone who is getting married. The author thought they would be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding a couple years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author feels hurt, especially since they found out through Facebook, which might indicate a lack of communication.\n\nFirst, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party. The main question is whether that's wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author mentions they understand it's the friend's day and she can choose her people. They also say it's not a major hardship but the cost and effort might not be worth it given their hurt feelings. They also plan to cut off contact after this, so it's a significant decision.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is usually expected, especially if you're close. But there's also the idea that if someone isn't in the wedding party, they might feel less obligated. However, the author is close to the friend, even if they've drifted a bit. The fact that they found out via Facebook first might add to the hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have changed her mind about roles, perhaps due to recent closeness with others. The author isn't being asked to attend; weddings are open to guests. So, if the author isn't in the wedding party, maybe they're not expected to attend. However, the author could still choose to go out of respect, even if they're not in the party.\n\nBut the author is also considering the cost and effort. If they're not in the wedding party, maybe the expense isn't justified. The author's main point is about not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship, so cutting off contact makes sense. Not attending the wedding could be a way to distance themselves, which might be justified if they feel undervalued.\n\nIs it wrong to not attend? It depends on the relationship and the reasons. If the author is hurt and feels unappreciated, maybe it's not wrong. But if the friend expects attendance regardless, the author might be seen as being petty. However, since the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not attending. The key is that the author isn't being disrespectful; they're making a personal choice based on their feelings and the state of their friendship.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
