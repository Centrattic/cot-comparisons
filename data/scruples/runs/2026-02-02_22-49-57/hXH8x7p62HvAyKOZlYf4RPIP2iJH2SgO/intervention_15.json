I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's wedding where the author wasn't invited as a bridesmaid, even though they thought they would be, given their 15-year friendship and the fact that the friend was the maid of honor at their own wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because their friend was in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend. The author now feels hurt and is questioning whether they should attend the wedding if they're not in the wedding party. The main conflict is about whether not attending is justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should think about social norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered important, especially after a long friendship, even if you're not in the wedding party. However, the author points out that they feel the friendship is one-sided. The friend didn't inform them of the engagement first, and now they're not in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending as a way to distance themselves from a friend they feel isn't valuing their relationship. \n\nOn one hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend, which could be harsh if the author still wants to maintain the friendship. On the other hand, if the author feels unappreciated and the friendship is one-sided, choosing to not attend could be a way to set boundaries. \n\nThe key factors are: the friend's actions (not informing them first, not including them in the wedding party), the author's feelings of being ignored or undervalued, and the decision to not attend as a result. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and the reasonableness of actions. The author isn't refusing to attend because of anger or spite but because they feel hurt and are reevaluating the friendship. The fact that the friend didn't reach out and included others who aren't close might support the author's perspective. \n\nHowever, attending a friend's wedding is often seen as a gesture of support, regardless of being in the party. So there's a counter-argument that attending is expected. But the author is not in the wedding party and feels it's a one-sided relationship now. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their decision is based on their feelings and the perception of the friendship being one-sided. They're not being vindictive but are choosing to focus on healthier relationships. So the answer should be B.\n"
