I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer has been friends with their friend for over 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, expecting to be told first. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and the writer wasn't in the wedding party at all. Now, the writer is considering not attending the wedding because they feel hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend's actions (not informing the writer first, not including her in the wedding party), the writer's feelings of being hurt and embarrassed, and the decision not to attend the wedding as a result.\n\nI need to assess whether the writer is in the wrong. The key here is whether attending a wedding is expected even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are often considered social events where guests are invited, not just the wedding party. Even if you're not part of the bridal party, attending is generally seen as a kind gesture to support the couple. However, there are exceptions if there are personal reasons or if the friendship is no longer strong.\n\nThe writer mentions that they've drifted apart recently, which might explain why the friend didn't include her in the wedding party. The writer feels that the friendship is one-sided now and doesn't want to continue it. Choosing not to attend could be a way of distancing themselves, which might be a personal choice rather than a social faux pas.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation of attending a friend's wedding. While it's common to attend, it's not mandatory. The writer is considering the costs and personal feelings. They're not attending to avoid embarrassment or because they feel unimportant. The question is whether this decision is inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the friend might expect an attendance, especially given the long friendship. Not attending could be seen as a slight, but if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's a mutual decision. The writer is making a choice to not invest in a relationship they feel is one-sided, which is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. The friend didn't inform them first, excluded them from the wedding party, and the writer feels hurt. The writer's decision to not attend is a consequence of the friend's actions. So, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their feelings and their own time and money.\n\nBut there's a cultural expectation to attend a close friend's wedding. However, if the friendship has become one-sided, that expectation might not hold. The writer is choosing to not attend because the friendship isn't as it once was, which could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They're making a personal choice based on their feelings and the current state of the friendship, and they're not obligated to attend if they feel it's not worth their time and emotional investment.\n"
