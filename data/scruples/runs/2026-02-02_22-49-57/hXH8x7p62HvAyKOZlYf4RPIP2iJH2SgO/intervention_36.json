I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if it's okay not to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. They were friends for 15 years, and they thought they'd be the maid of honor, especially since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and the author is hurt. They're considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the expense and effort, and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Typically, people attend their close friends' weddings even if they're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions, like distance, financial constraints, or other personal reasons. The author mentions they live a few states away, so the cost might be a factor. But they also say it's not a major hardship, just not worth it. That's a bit conflicting\u2014cost isn't the main issue, but their feelings are. \n\nThe friend didn't inform the author about the wedding initially, which is a problem. Maybe the author felt slighted because they weren't told first. The friend chose someone else as maid of honor, which the author thought would be them. That could have been a betrayal, especially since they were the maid of honor for the friend's wedding. The author is hurt and feels the friendship has drifted. \n\nThe question is whether not attending is justified. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and deciding to cut off contact. But is that fair? Weddings are usually joyous events, and not attending might be seen as cutting off ties, which could be harsh. On the other hand, the author feels unappreciated and the friendship is one-sided. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend didn't inform the author first, the author was hurt by not being asked to be a bridesmaid, and they're not attending because of that. Whether it's right or wrong depends on cultural or personal expectations. In some cultures, attending close friends' weddings is expected regardless of being in the party. But if the friendship has genuinely deteriorated, maybe the author is justified. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're processing their hurt and making a choice based on their feelings. They are also honest about not wanting a one-sided friendship. So, while it's a sensitive decision, they might not be in the wrong. The friend might have miscommunicated or the friendship did drift. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own emotional well-being. So, probably answer B.\n"
