I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The writer and their friend have been friends for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the writer's wedding two years ago. The writer expected to be the maid of honor this time but found out through Facebook that another friend was chosen. The writer felt hurt but eventually realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's a few states away and would require some effort.\n\nSo, the writer is conflicted. On one hand, they're hurt and maybe feel slighted. On the other, they don't want to attend if they aren't part of the wedding party. The main question is whether the writer is in the wrong for deciding not to attend.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered important, especially for long-term friends. But sometimes, people have different expectations. The writer might feel that since they aren't in the wedding party, attending isn't necessary. But maybe they should still go to support their friend.\n\nThe writer also mentions they are not interested in a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact. That shows they're prioritizing their own feelings. But is it wrong to not attend? Well, the friend didn't necessarily exclude them; they just chose other people for the wedding party. The writer could still attend to celebrate their friend's day. However, if they feel attending would be awkward or hurtful, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether not attending is a justified response.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might have drifted apart, and the writer is aware of that. Maybe they're using the wedding as an excuse to end the friendship. But the writer is honest about their feelings and isn't attending just to be spiteful. They're considering the effort involved and their own emotional state.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, is it wrong to not attend? It's a personal choice. Some might say that attending is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. Others might say that if you're not part of the core group, it's okay to not attend. The writer isn't being mean-spirited; they're making a decision based on their feelings.\n\nBut maybe the writer should attend to show support, even if they're hurt. However, if they feel attending would be painful and they're already distancing themselves, is it wrong? The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific friendship dynamics.\n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice based on their emotional state and the existing drift in the friendship. They aren't being malicious; they're prioritizing their own well-being. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
