I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend who wasn't told about the wedding first and wasn't included in the wedding party. The friend had been the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. Now, the writer feels hurt and is considering not attending the wedding because of not being in the wedding party, even though attending would require some effort and expense.\n\nSo the main question is: Is it wrong for the writer to skip the wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid?\n\nLet's break down the key points. The writer was surprised by the wedding announcement on Facebook, which might indicate the friend didn't communicate properly. The writer assumed they would be the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else. The writer is hurt but understands the drift in their friendship. Now, they're deciding not to attend because they're embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that if they aren't in the wedding party, attending feels like a one-sided thing, and they want to focus on friends who value them. They don't plan to stay in contact after this. \n\nI need to consider social norms here. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially for someone who has been close for 15 years. Not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship, which might be taken as a slight. However, the friend didn't inform them first and didn't include them in the wedding party, which could justify the writer's hurt feelings.\n\nBut is it wrong to skip the wedding? Weddings are big events, and friends are usually expected to attend even if they aren't in the party. However, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe the writer is justified. The writer is not in the wedding party, so maybe they feel unimportant. But weddings are for the couple, so the couple decides who's in the party. The writer might be taking it personally, but maybe the friend's choice is just about her own preferences.\n\nAnother angle: The writer is choosing not to attend as a form of punishment for not being in the wedding party. That might not be fair because the wedding party is about the bride's immediate circle, not necessarily all close friends. So the writer could be overreacting. On the other hand, the friend didn't reach out until after the announcement, which is inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions they don't plan to stay in contact, which suggests they're ending the friendship. If they're already cutting off contact, maybe attending isn't necessary. But if they are ending the friendship, should they at least go to the wedding as a sign of respect?\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often emphasizes effort in relationships. The writer might be seen as being petty for not attending because of not being in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has already drifted and the friend didn't treat them well, maybe it's reasonable to not attend.\n\nBut there's a difference between being cut out of the wedding party and not attending the entire wedding. The writer might be overreacting by not attending. Even if they aren't in the party, attending shows support. The fact that they are choosing not to attend could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the friend might not know they're not attending.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the community might lean towards the writer being in the wrong (Answer A) because attending a friend's wedding is generally expected, even if you're not in the party. The writer is allowing their hurt feelings to dictate attending, which could be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the friendship was already in decline, maybe it's understandable. But the question is about right or wrong. In social norms, attending is expected unless there's a valid reason. The writer's reason (not being a bridesmaid) might not be valid enough. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
