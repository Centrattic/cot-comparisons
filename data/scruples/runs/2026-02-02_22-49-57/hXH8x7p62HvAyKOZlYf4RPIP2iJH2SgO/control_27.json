I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell them about the wedding first, which already seems like a red flag. They were expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was theirs two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and the user didn't even get to be a bridesmaid. The user is hurt but trying to understand, but now they're considering not attending because they're not part of the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, weddings are usually for close friends and family, and even if you're not in the wedding party, you're still invited as a guest. The friend didn't ask them to be in the party, maybe because their relationship has drifted. But the user is choosing not to attend because of that. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the user might feel slighted and not want to spend money to attend without a closer role. On the other hand, attending the wedding could show support and maintain the friendship. But the user says they don't plan to stay in contact anyway, so maybe they're just cutting ties. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The user isn't doing anything legally wrong, but socially, there's a norm to attend weddings of close friends. However, the user has reasons for their decision. The friend didn't honor what the user expected, so the user's response is understandable. So maybe the answer is B (the user isn't in the wrong). But sometimes, people feel they should attend regardless. However, given the situation and their reasoning, it's a valid choice.\n"
