I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is that they were best friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Now, the friend is getting married but didn't ask them to be in the wedding party. The author feels hurt and thinks they were drifting apart, but they're considering not attending because it's a hassle and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. The cost and time might be a factor, but usually, friends make an effort. However, the author is hurt and feels the relationship has changed. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. Maybe the friend didn't value them as much as the author thought. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're not in the wedding party, so they don't see the point. But culturally, weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about the guests being in the party. Not attending could be seen as a slight, but the author is also choosing to end the friendship. They mention not staying in contact after. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're reacting to being excluded and feeling disrespected by not being told first. On the other, not attending might be hurtful to the friend. But the author is prioritizing their own feelings and recognizing that the friend isn't valuing the friendship as before. \n\nI think the key points are the friend's failure to communicate and the shift in the relationship. The author isn't obligated to attend if they feel the friendship isn't reciprocal. So, the answer is B.\n"
