I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which is a red flag. Then, the author expected to be the maid of honor because they were in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author was hurt but tried to understand. Then, upon checking Facebook, the author realized they weren't even in the wedding party.\n\nThe author is considering not attending because it's a hassle (cost, time off) and feels it's a one-sided friendship now. They plan to cut contact after. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in skipping the wedding. Attending someone's wedding is a big deal, especially for a 15-year friend. But the author wasn't in the wedding party, which is a significant snub. The friend didn't communicate well, leading to the author feeling hurt and undervalued. \n\nThe author is making a choice to prioritize their feelings and not invest in a one-sided relationship. While it's respectful to attend if possible, it's understandable if the author feels it's not worth their emotional or financial investment, especially if they plan to distance themselves anyway. \n\nThe key points are the friend's failure to communicate, the snub of not being in the wedding party, and the author's decision to not attend as a result. The author isn't obligated to attend, especially if they feel their friendship isn't reciprocal. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
