I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The situation is that the author thought they would be the maid of honor, since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but understands that they've drifted apart. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered a social obligation, especially if they are a close friend. But the author mentions that the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook first, which might indicate some distance in their relationship. They also mention that they've drifted apart over the past few years. \n\nThe author isn't in the wedding party, which might mean they weren't part of the inner circle anymore. However, not attending a wedding because you're not in the party is a big decision. Weddings are usually a celebration, and not going could be seen as a slight, but the user feels it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nBut the author is also considering the cost and effort\u2014plane ticket, hotel, time off. It's a financial and time investment. They might feel it's not worth it if the friend isn't prioritizing them. The key here is the emotional aspect. The author is hurt and wants to focus on friendships that are mutual. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, social expectations might lean towards attending, but the author's feelings are valid. They're making a personal choice based on their current relationship status. If they decide not to go, it's their prerogative, especially since the friend didn't include them in the wedding party. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision based on their feelings and the state of their friendship. Answer B.\n"
