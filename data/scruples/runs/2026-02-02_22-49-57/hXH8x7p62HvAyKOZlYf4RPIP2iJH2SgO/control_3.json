I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not attending her friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been friends for 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding via Facebook, which was a surprise. The author assumed she'd be the maid of honor because her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, the friend's wedding party includes people they haven't been close with recently. The author is considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party, and she's planning to cut contact after this.\n\nSo, the core of the question is whether it's wrong to skip the wedding for this reason. Let's think about social norms here. Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important, regardless of being in the wedding party. Even if you're not part of the bridal party, being there is a sign of support and respect. However, the author feels slighted and is choosing to distance herself. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't explicitly exclude her. The author found out through Facebook, which might be a separate issue. But the main point here is attendance. The author is feeling that the friendship is one-sided now and wants to focus on other friends. That's a personal choice, but does that make her the asshole? \n\nIn terms of social expectations, not attending a close friend's wedding without a valid reason could be seen as rude. But if the friendship is already strained and the author is making a point about being in a one-sided relationship, maybe she's justified. However, the friend might still expect her to come, even if she's not in the wedding party. The author is allowing her hurt feelings to influence her decision to attend. \n\nOn the other side, the friend didn't inform her first, which is a red flag. Maybe that's part of the problem. The author had a right to feel hurt about not being told first and not being chosen as a bridesmaid. But the decision to not attend could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be harsh. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's not attending, she's avoiding a situation where she could potentially mend the friendship or show support despite the hurt. However, if she feels the friendship is no longer mutual, walking away isn't inherently wrong. But socially, attending a close friend's wedding is expected unless there's a major conflict. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's decision to not attend is justified by her feelings about the friendship. If she's already planning to cut contact, maybe she's making a point. But socially, it's seen as being in the wrong because weddings are significant events. However, the friend's actions of not informing her first and excluding her could be part of the problem. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at both sides. The friend's failure to communicate and include the author might make the author's decision more understandable. But the author's choice to not attend could be seen as avoiding the situation. However, the post says she's not in the wedding party, so maybe it's not seen as a personal slight, just a friend's choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her feelings about the friendship, and the friend's actions contributed to the situation. The author isn't obligated to attend if she feels the friendship is one-sided and the friend didn't communicate properly. The answer would lean towards B.\n"
