I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a friend's wedding. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't invited to the wedding party and now doesn't want to attend the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was surprising. She thought the friend would tell her first. The friend was the maid of honor at her wedding, so the author expected to be the maid of honor here. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend. Then, the author saw the wedding party list and noticed others who aren't close anymore. She's hurt but understands it's the friend's day. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. So, should the author go to the wedding even if not in the wedding party? Well, weddings are usually open to friends and family. Not being in the wedding party doesn't mean you shouldn't attend. The author is planning to not attend because of the hurt feelings. Is that wrong?\n\nThe friend didn't ask her to be in the wedding party, maybe because they've drifted apart. The author is considering this a one-sided friendship and wants to focus on others. But the author is choosing not to attend the wedding, which is a significant event. \n\nI think the key points here are: The author is hurt but acknowledges it's the friend's day. She's not obligated to attend, but maybe she should. However, her decision not to attend because of being excluded from the wedding party might be seen as a response to being snubbed. But is that at fault?\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have expected the author to attend regardless. On the other, the author feels it's not worth the effort if she's not part of the wedding party. The author is also saying she plans to cut off contact, which might be a bigger issue. \n\nBut the question is specifically about not attending. The author isn't being asked to attend, so she's not obligated. However, in some social norms, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the party. If she doesn't attend, maybe that's seen as a slight. But the author is hurt and feels unappreciated. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's making a conscious choice to not attend because of being excluded from the wedding party, maybe she is. Because the friend might have expected her to still come. But if the author is prioritizing her own feelings and deciding not to attend due to the effort and the hurt, maybe not. \n\nThe original question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer hinges on social expectations. In many cases, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if not in the party. So if she skips it, others might see that as a problem. But the author is also planning to cut off contact, which is a bigger issue. However, the question is just about attending the wedding. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's entitled to her feelings and isn't obligated to attend if she's not part of the wedding party. But others might argue she should attend regardless. But given her explanation, the author is not being unreasonable. She's hurt, but making a choice that's right for her. So B.\n"
