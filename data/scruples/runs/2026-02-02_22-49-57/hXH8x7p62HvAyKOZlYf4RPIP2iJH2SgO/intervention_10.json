I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and considering not attending the wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 15-year friend who found out about the wedding on Facebook. They were hurt because they expected to be the maid of honor, as they had been the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. Now, the friend chose another childhood bestie for maid of honor and included others not as close. The author feels hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. They're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's not a huge hardship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider cultural norms. In many cases, weddings are big events where guests are invited, even if they're not in the wedding party. The author might feel slighted, but skipping the wedding due to not being in the party could be seen as a big reaction. However, the author also mentions wanting to focus on mutual friendships and not being in a one-sided one. \n\nThe friend didn't inform the author first, which adds to the hurt. The author was the maid of honor before, so expectations were there. Now, the friend chose others, possibly because of a drift. The author's decision to not attend might be about their own feelings of being undervalued, not just about the wedding party. \n\nIs the author wrong for not attending? Some might say yes because weddings are about celebrating the couple, and not attending could be seen as petty. Others might say no, as the author is prioritizing their own feelings and boundaries. The author is not in the wedding party, so maybe they feel it's not their event anymore. \n\nBut usually, even if you're not in the party, attending shows support. However, the author has other plans and doesn't want to invest in something that feels one-sided. The friend might not realize the author's hurt, but the author is making a choice based on their own feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But in many perspectives, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason is their feelings, which are valid. However, some might argue that the friendship has already drifted, so the author is justified in moving on. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is wrong. If the answer hinges on social expectations versus personal feelings, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their emotional state and the dynamics of the friendship. So the answer would be B.\n"
