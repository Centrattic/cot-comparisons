I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't in the wedding party. The author and the friend have been friends for 15 years. The author was surprised when she found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might be a red flag. She thought she would be the maid of honor since her friend was her maid of honor in her wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The author still expected to be a bridesmaid, but now it's clear she's not in the wedding party at all. She's hurt but understands it's the friend's day. However, she's considering not attending because it's a hassle and she's embarrassed. She doesn't want to maintain a one-sided friendship and plans to cut contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is customary, regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is making a choice based on her feelings. She's hurt and feels slighted. Is it wrong to prioritize her feelings?\n\nThe friend didn't reach out first, which might indicate a drifting relationship. The author tried to reconnect by congratulating her and discussing plans but wasn't invited to the wedding party. The author is now choosing not to attend because attending would be an effort without reciprocation. \n\nIs the author wrong for valuing her time and emotional well-being? Maybe not. Friendships should be mutual. If the friend didn't include her, maybe the author is justified in not attending. But some might argue that attending a wedding is a social expectation. However, the author is making her own decision based on her experience.\n\nThe key points are: the friend didn't inform her first, chose someone else for the wedding party despite past closeness, and the author feels the friendship is one-sided. She's not attending to save money or time, but because of hurt feelings and lack of reciprocation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But from the author's perspective, choosing to prioritize her feelings is reasonable. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
