I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author was expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose a childhood best friend instead. The author was hurt but understood the drift. Then, the author realized they weren't in the wedding party at all, and now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're embarrassed and feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the decision to attend. Traditionally, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending a close friend's wedding is considered a given, especially if you've been friends for 15 years. The author is considering not attending due to hurt feelings and a desire to focus on other friends. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, while it's understandable to feel hurt, the decision to attend a wedding is more about supporting a friend's big day than just being in the party. Not attending might be seen as holding a grudge over not being asked as a bridesmaid. However, the friend did reach out and talk about the wedding plans, so maybe there was a communication gap. The author might feel slighted, but cutting off contact entirely could be seen as extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering the cost and effort. However, attending a wedding is often considered a priority despite expenses. The question is about being in the wrong. If the author's friend expected them to attend, then not going could be seen as a slight. But since the author mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship, maybe it's a mutual decision. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid feelings and choosing to not attend because they feel undervalued isn't wrong. However, some might argue that attending is still the right choice. But based on the information, the author's reasoning is understandable.\n"
