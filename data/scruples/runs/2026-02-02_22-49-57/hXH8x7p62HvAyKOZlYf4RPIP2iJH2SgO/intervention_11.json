I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person is a 15-year friend who wasn't initially told about the wedding, found out on Facebook, and was expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and now the person is considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the hurt feelings. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. Then, the person assumed they'd be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated before. The friend chose others, including someone not as close recently. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending, which is costly and requires time off work.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Usually, close friends are invited, and being in the wedding party is a big honor. However, the author isn't part of it, so they might feel slighted. But should attending the wedding be contingent on being in the party? That's the question. \n\nThe author is also considering cutting off contact after, which shows they feel the friendship is one-sided. They're not attending because they're hurt, but maybe they have a right to prioritize their feelings. On the other hand, some might say attending is expected regardless. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're not attending because they're hurt, maybe they're justified. The friend didn't include them in the initial announcement, which is unkind. The author isn't obligated to attend if they're not part of the party. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut some might argue that attending is a gesture of goodwill regardless. However, given the friend's behavior, the author's decision is understandable. So, the answer is probably B.\n"
