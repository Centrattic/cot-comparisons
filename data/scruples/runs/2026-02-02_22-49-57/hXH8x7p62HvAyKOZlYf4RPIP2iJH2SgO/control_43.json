I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should attend their friend's wedding even though they weren't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has known their friend for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author thought they would be the maid of honor but found out through Facebook that another childhood friend was chosen. The friend didn't inform them directly, which hurt the author. Then, when the author checked the wedding party list, they weren't included at all. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they feel it's not worth the effort and expense, and they feel the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether attending the wedding is expected even without being in the wedding party. The author is hurt, but is it wrong to not attend?\n\nI know that in some cultures, attending a friend's wedding is a given, but in others, it's more about the wedding party. Also, the author mentions that they are not interested in a one-sided friendship. The friend didn't communicate well, didn't inform them directly, and didn't include them in the wedding party. The author is making a decision based on their feelings and the effort required.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to attend regardless? If the friend didn't include them, maybe the author feels disrespected. However, sometimes people make choices about their wedding party based on various factors, not necessarily the strength of the friendship. The author could attend as a guest, but they're choosing not to. Is that wrong?\n\nThe key points are the friend's actions (not informing first, not including in the party) and the author's response. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and resources. The friend might be hurt if the author doesn't attend, but is the author in the wrong if they feel the friendship isn't reciprocal now? It's possible that the author is justified in their decision, especially if they feel unvalued. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
