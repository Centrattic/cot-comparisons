I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The author has been friends with this person for 15 years and was the maid of honor at their friend's wedding two years ago. Now, the friend didn't tell them first, and when the author found out, they were excluded from the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor again since the friend was their maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt because they weren't informed first and now aren't in the wedding party. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect a wedding invitation just because you're a long-time friend? Weddings are personal events, and the couple chooses their guests. Not being in the wedding party doesn't necessarily mean you aren't invited. The author is considering not attending because of the hurt feelings. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing that? Well, they are a friend, even if not in the wedding party. However, the author is also saying they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact. That's their choice. Attending a wedding can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, especially for a long-time friend. Not attending might be hurtful to the friend, but the author's feelings are also valid. \n\nThe key points: The friend didn't inform them first, which is rude. The author was hurt and felt excluded. Choosing not to attend might seem harsh, but they have reasons. However, weddings are about celebrating the couple, so attending might be expected regardless of being in the party. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make personal decisions about their time and attendance, especially given the circumstances. While attending could have been nice, they're not obligated to go if it's causing them emotional distress. The friend's actions were questionable (not informing them first), which adds to the complexity. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend.\n"
