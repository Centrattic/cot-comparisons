I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the user is a long-time friend, over 15 years. They thought they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But now the friend has chosen someone else, maybe a childhood best friend. The user feels hurt but understands the drift. However, when looking at the wedding party list, the user realizes they're not part of it. The user is considering not attending because they're hurt and think the friendship is one-sided now. They plan to cut contact after this.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether attending the wedding is a moral obligation even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and attending usually involves expenses and time. The user is hurt and feels slighted. They don't want to attend because they feel unappreciated. But is it wrong to not attend?\n\nTraditionally, close friends are expected to attend weddings even if they're not part of the party. But the user feels the friendship has changed. The friend didn't inform them first, which might indicate some drift. The user is also thinking about future contact, deciding not to stay in touch. So maybe they're using the wedding as a way to cut ties.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that if the friend doesn't value their presence as a bridesmaid, then attending is not necessary. They might see this as a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, some might say that attending is a kindness, regardless of being in the party. But if the user is already moving away from the friendship, maybe it's not in the wrong to not attend.\n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. If the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the user is justified in not attending, especially if they feel the friendship is no longer mutual. The user isn't being malicious; they're making a choice based on their feelings. So the answer is probably B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
