I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding, and now is considering not attending the wedding at all. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the friendship's history, the author's expectations, and the friend's actions. The friend didn't inform the author first, which is a red flag. The author was a maid of honor at her wedding two years ago, so there's a precedent. The friend later chose someone else as maid of honor, and included others in the wedding party who aren't close anymore. The author feels hurt and wants to cut off contact, hence not attending the wedding.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The author's reasoning is about the one-sided friendship and the effort required to attend (cost, time off). But is not attending the wedding a justified response?\n\nWeddings are major life events, and attending is often expected by the host, regardless of one's role in the party. However, the author's hurt feelings are valid. The friend's failure to communicate and the exclusion from the wedding party could be seen as a breach of friendship norms, especially given their history. \n\nBut is it acceptable to walk out on the friendship entirely? The author mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship and plans to cut off contact. That's a personal choice, but not attending a wedding might be seen as cutting off contact abruptly. However, if the friendship has been drifting and the friend is prioritizing others, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to move on.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the friend's actions, the lack of communication, and the author's right to prioritize their own feelings, I think B (No) is the right answer. The author isn't obligated to attend if they feel hurt and the friendship isn't reciprocal. Also, the effort required (money, time) isn't insignificant, and the author's emotional response is valid.\n"
