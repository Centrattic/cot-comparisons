I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The friend was surprised when she found out via Facebook, thought she was supposed to be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor at her wedding. Then the friend chose someone else, and the author is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. They were friends for 15 years, so it's a long-term relationship. The author felt it was their role to be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated by having the friend as their maid of honor. Now, the friend hasn't included them, which is hurtful. The author is deciding not to attend, which is their choice. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're not part of the wedding party, attending is a nice gesture, but not mandatory. The author is hurt, which is understandable. They might feel slighted, but the friend might have her reasons, like drifting apart. The author is choosing their own path, focusing on other friends. \n\nSome might argue that attending the wedding is important for the friendship, but others might say that the friend's actions have already caused enough hurt. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely but is choosing not to attend. The cost is a factor too\u2014traveling is an expense. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether the author's decision is selfish. If they're making a choice that's best for their own feelings without being vindictive, maybe not. The author is not forcing the friend to do anything but choosing their own attendance. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being and moving on from a drifting friendship. The friend might have made a different choice, but that doesn't make the author at fault for not attending.\n"
