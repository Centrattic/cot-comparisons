I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend not being invited to a wedding party after being a close friend for 15 years and being the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author expected to be in the wedding party, maybe even the maid of honor, given their history. However, the friend chose someone else, which hurts the author. The author feels the friendship has drifted, and now they're questioning whether it's worth attending the wedding, which involves some expense and effort.\n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings of hurt and betrayal, the friend's decision to invite others not as close, and the author's decision to not attend as a form of self-respect or to avoid further disappointment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should think about social norms. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions, especially if the relationship has become one-sided. The author mentions they're not interested in a one-sided friendship and plan to cut ties. That might indicate that the author is setting boundaries, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the friend not informing the author first, which is inconsiderate. The author did reach out and get involved in planning, which might have led to the assumption of being in the wedding party. The friend's actions could be seen as dismissive, which justifies the author's hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, not attending a wedding is a significant decision. Some might argue that attending is important to support the friend despite the hurt. But others would say it's okay to prioritize your own feelings and not attend if the relationship isn't reciprocal.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's polite to attend a friend's wedding. But if the friendship is already deteriorating, maybe not attending is a way to end it gracefully. The author isn't being malicious; they're making a decision based on their own needs and the friend's actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to feel hurt and to choose how to handle the situation. The friend's actions contributed to the hurt, so the author isn't at fault for not attending.\n"
