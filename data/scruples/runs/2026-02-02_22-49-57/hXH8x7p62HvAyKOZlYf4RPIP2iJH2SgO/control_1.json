I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. The author was expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else, and now the author is considering skipping the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to attend without being in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author thought they were close enough to be in the wedding party, but the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. They're now considering not attending because it's not worth the effort and they feel it's a one-sided relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's expectations vs. reality, the friend's actions (using Facebook to announce instead of direct contact), the emotional impact on the author, and the decision to not attend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding is a big commitment, and while it's common to attend friends' weddings, it's not a strict rule. If someone isn't in the wedding party, it's sometimes seen as less expected to attend, but many people still go out of respect. However, the author feels it's a one-sided friendship now and doesn't want to invest time/money in a relationship they feel isn't reciprocal.\n\nThe friend's actions might be seen as neglectful for not informing the author first, which could have caused the hurt feelings. The author's decision to not attend is more about their own feelings and boundaries. They're not necessarily being selfish; they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether attending a wedding is a social obligation, especially when not in the wedding party. If the author feels they're not wanted or that the friendship is one-sided, it's reasonable to choose not to attend. However, some might argue that attending is still important regardless of being in the wedding party. But given the context of the author's hurt and the friend's actions, it's understandable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice based on their feelings.\n"
