I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nThe situation is that the friend has known her for over 15 years. The friend found out via Facebook, which was surprising because she expected to be told first. The author thought she would be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend. The author was still expecting to be a bridesmaid, but even that didn't happen because the friend included people not close recently.\n\nNow the author is hurt and considering not attending the wedding. She's thinking about the costs involved (plane ticket, hotel, time off) and feels it's not worth it since she's embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. She plans to cut contact after this.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations vs. reality. The author felt entitled to be in the wedding party based on past reciprocity. However, the friend made different choices, possibly due to drifting apart. The author is hurt but trying to understand that it's the friend's day. Still, she's deciding not to attend, which is a big deal.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a gesture of goodwill. But the author feels the friendship is one-sided now. She's not in the wedding party, maybe the friend hasn't been as close, and she's cutting ties. \n\nBut the author isn't being asked to attend; she's choosing not to. The friend might feel hurt if the author doesn't show up. However, the author has legitimate feelings of being slighted and not valued. She's also considering the effort and cost. \n\nIn some perspectives, friends attend each other's weddings regardless of being in the party. But if the friendship has changed, maybe it's okay to step back. The author isn't being rude by not attending; she's just prioritizing her feelings. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not in the wedding party, maybe the friend expects her to come, but if their friendship has diminished, maybe not. The author isn't ignoring it entirely; she's just choosing not to participate as a guest. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong because attending is a choice, and she's justified in her feelings. But some might argue that attending is respectful. However, the context of a drifting friendship and her hurt feelings could support her decision.\n"
