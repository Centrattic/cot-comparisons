I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The friend is getting married, they found out on Facebook, which already hurt their feelings. The user thought they'd be the maid of honor, like their friend was in their wedding. Then they found out the friend chose someone else, even though they've drifted apart. Now they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, the hurt feelings are valid. The friend didn't tell them first, which is a big deal. Then not being in the wedding party is another blow. The user is considering not attending as a way to respond. But is that wrong?\n\nWeddings are usually for close friends and family. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a common courtesy. The user is thinking about the time and money involved, but maybe they're using that as an excuse to avoid the hurt. Also, cutting off contact after might be a reaction to feeling slighted. However, not attending could be seen as punishing the friend, which might not be fair. The friend might not realize the hurt caused and might expect attendance regardless. The user's decision could be seen as reasonable if they feel the friendship has become one-sided, but maybe they should talk to the friend first instead of just not showing up. So, is the user in the wrong? If they don't attend without a conversation, maybe. But if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, then perhaps not. Hmm. Need to weigh the social expectations vs. personal feelings.\n"
