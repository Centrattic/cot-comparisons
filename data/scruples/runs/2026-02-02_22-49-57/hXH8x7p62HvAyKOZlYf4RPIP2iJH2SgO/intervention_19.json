I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The author was a surprise on Facebook about the friend's engagement. They thought they'd be the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else. The author assumed they'd at least be a bridesmaid but later found out they're not in the wedding party at all. Now, they're considering not attending because they don't want to be there without being part of the wedding party. They mention it's a few states away, so there's a cost involved, but it's manageable. They also say they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were close for 15 years, had a two-way exchange (the friend was maid of honor at their wedding). Being left out of the wedding party might feel like a slight. Attending might make them uncomfortable, especially if they're hurt. The cost is a factor, but not prohibitive. They want to focus on reciprocal friendships, which is reasonable.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective: Maybe they feel they have the right to choose their wedding party based on current relationships. If they drifted apart, maybe they felt the other friends were more involved now. The author's absence might hurt their feelings, but it's the author's choice to attend or not.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Attending a wedding is a personal choice. Not attending because you're not in the wedding party isn't uncommon. The author is prioritizing their own feelings and comfort. They aren't being malicious; they're not attending because they feel slighted. The friend might be upset, but the author isn't obligated to attend. The cost is a factor, but the main issue is emotional. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged for their intentions. The author isn't being cruel; they're making a personal decision. Friends have different dynamics, and it's possible the friend didn't consider the author's feelings when choosing the wedding party. The author's choice to not attend is their right, especially if they feel the friendship has become one-sided. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
