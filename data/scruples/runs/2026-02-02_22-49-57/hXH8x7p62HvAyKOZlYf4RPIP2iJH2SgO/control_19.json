I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the friendship dynamics. The friend has known them for 15 years, which is a long time. The writer was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might indicate a lack of communication. They were expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their own wedding. But instead, another childhood friend was chosen. The writer feels hurt but understands that they've drifted apart.\n\nNow, the question is whether not attending the wedding is justified. The writer is considering the costs\u2014plane ticket, hotel, time off work. They feel it's not worth it because they're already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. They also mention wanting to focus on reciprocal friendships.\n\nI should think about the expectations in friendships. The friend might have had her reasons for choosing her wedding party, maybe based on current relationships or other factors. But the writer's reaction is to cut contact entirely and not attend. Is that fair? Attending a wedding is a social norm, even if you're not in the wedding party. But maybe it's unreasonable to expect someone to attend if they're not invited to the party.\n\nWait, the writer didn't say they were not invited to the wedding. They just aren't in the wedding party. So maybe the wedding itself is still open to all friends and family. If that's the case, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact. But if the invitation is only to the wedding party, then the writer isn't in the loop. The question is a bit ambiguous on that. The original post mentions that the friend lives a few states away, so maybe the wedding is a big event that's open to friends.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship and don't want to attend if they aren't honored. However, not being in the wedding party doesn't necessarily mean the friend is being one-sided. Maybe the friend has other plans or different priorities. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer is making a decision to distance themselves from the friend, which could be harsh. But they are within their rights to choose how they spend their time and money. The question is whether they are in the wrong for making that choice. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is a common expectation, but it's not a legal requirement. The writer is choosing not to attend, which might be seen as selfish by some, but others might understand if the friendship has faded. The key here is the writer's intent. They are not attending because they feel slighted and don't want to engage in a one-sided relationship. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether attending is expected. If the friend is inviting all close friends, then not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship. But if the invitation is only to the wedding party, then the writer isn't in the wrong. However, the original question doesn't specify if the writer will be invited to the wedding itself. The user might assume they are invited but just not in the party. \n\nIn that case, the writer is choosing not to attend because of the slight. But weddings are significant events, and not attending might cause further hurt. However, the writer's feelings are valid. They've been hurt and are making a choice based on their emotional response. It's a personal decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the writer isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and deciding not to attend if it's not worth the emotional cost. They are not required to attend, even if it might be disappointing for the bride.\n"
