I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a friend of over 15 years who got engaged. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was surprising because they expected to be told first. They congratulated the friend and discussed wedding plans, assuming they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author thought they would still be a bridesmaid but later found out that even that wasn't the case. The wedding party includes some people the friend hasn't been close with recently. The author feels hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to deal with the expense and time off. They also mention that they don't plan to stay in contact after the wedding.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations here. The author assumed they would be in the wedding party, especially since they were once close enough for the friend to be the maid of honor at their wedding. The fact that the friend found out about the author's wedding and included them as a maid of honor suggests they had a close relationship. However, over the past few years, the friendship has drifted. The friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, which the author acknowledges but still thought they would be a bridesmaid. The author is hurt but tries to rationalize it as the friend's choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether not attending the wedding is wrong. The author is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. The author is also planning to cut contact afterward. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, especially for close friends, regardless of whether you're in the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and not attending might be seen as hurtful, even if the person isn't in the wedding party. However, the author's feelings of being slighted and the drift in the friendship might affect their perspective. The author might feel it's unfair to invest time and money into attending when they're not part of the wedding party, especially if they're planning to distance themselves anyway.\n\nBut from the friend's perspective, not inviting the author to the wedding party could be a breach of expected roles, especially if there was an unspoken assumption based on their past. However, the friend might have her reasons, and it's her choice who to include. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a way to avoid dealing with the hurt feelings or the awkwardness of being excluded from the wedding party.\n\nI should also consider the effort involved. The author mentioned that attending would require buying a plane ticket, a hotel, and taking time off work. While not a major hardship, it's a cost they might not be willing to bear. However, in many cultures, attending such events is considered a priority for close friends, even if there's some personal expense involved.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intention to not stay in contact. That might indicate they feel the friendship isn't worth maintaining, so attending the wedding might be seen as a last gesture. However, if they're already planning to cut ties, maybe attending isn't necessary, but it could still be considered disrespectful.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that attending is about supporting the friend on their big day, regardless of personal feelings. Others might say that if the friendship has deteriorated, it's okay to prioritize one's own well-being. The author's hurt feelings are valid, but the decision to attend or not is a personal one. However, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the friend didn't have malicious intent and the author is making a choice based on their own feelings, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But not attending a close friend's wedding could be seen as a breach of social expectations unless there's a valid reason.\n\nBut the author is in a state where they're planning to end the friendship. In that case, maybe they feel it's okay to not attend. However, even if the friendship is ending, attending the wedding could be a closure. If the friend was unaware of the drift, the author's absence might cause hurt. But the author already feels hurt by not being included in the wedding party.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author's decision is understandable given their feelings and the state of the friendship, but socially, there's an expectation to attend a close friend's wedding. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have valid reasons for their decision, but they might be seen as dismissive or hurtful. However, considering the drift in the friendship and the author's intention to not stay in contact, maybe it's a justified choice. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
