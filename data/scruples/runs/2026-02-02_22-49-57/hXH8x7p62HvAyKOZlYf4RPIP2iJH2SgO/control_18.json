I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and now considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the friend have been friends for over 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author expected the same in return. However, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. Now they're thinking of skipping the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, not because they don't want to celebrate, but because they feel slighted.\n\nThe main question is whether it's wrong to not attend. The author is considering not going to avoid embarrassment and because they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact with the friend after this.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, weddings are generally events to celebrate the couple, not about the guest's feelings. Even if someone isn't in the wedding party, it's usually expected to attend unless there are major obstacles. The author is choosing not to attend due to personal hurt feelings, which could be seen as a breach of friendship norms. However, the author is also justified in feeling hurt, especially since they had a close relationship and the friend didn't reach out to them first.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author was surprised the friend didn't tell them first, which might indicate some existing tension. The friend's decision to include others in the wedding party could be due to changes in their friendship over the years. The author's decision to not attend might be a way to protect their feelings, which isn't entirely wrong. However, it could also be seen as cutting off contact based on a single situation, which might be hasty.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because attending a wedding is a social expectation unless there's a valid reason. If B (no), it's because the author is prioritizing their feelings and the friendship has changed. I need to weigh the social norms against the personal feelings here. \n\nThe key point is that the author is not attending because they weren't included in the party, which is a personal issue rather than a necessity. Socially, people might expect them to attend regardless, but emotionally, it's understandable. However, the author might be overreacting by not attending, which could damage the friendship further. On the other hand, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe this is a justified decision.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think the answer is B (No), because the author has the right to prioritize their feelings, especially if the friendship has changed. But some might argue it's still their place to attend. However, the author isn't being malicious, just hurt and making a choice based on their current relationship.\n"
