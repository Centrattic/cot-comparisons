I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend for 15 years. When the author got married two years ago, the friend was the maid of honor. Now, the friend is getting married, and the author expected to be the maid of honor again, but instead, another childhood friend was chosen. The author felt hurt but understood they'd drifted apart. Then, when looking at the wedding party list, the author wasn't included at all. The author is now considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the wedding party and don't want to put in the effort (plane ticket, hotel, time off work). They mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author's reasoning is that since they weren't included in the wedding party, they feel embarrassed and don't want to attend. They also don't want to continue the friendship if it's one-sided. \n\nFrom a social perspective, weddings are significant events, and attending is often expected even if you're not part of the wedding party. Not attending might be seen as a slight, especially since the friend didn't include them in the party but they were expected to be there. However, the author did try to reach out initially, and the friend didn't inform them first, which might have contributed to the hurt feelings. \n\nThe author is not obligating themselves, but choosing based on their feelings and the effort required. But there's a cultural aspect where attending weddings is a social obligation. However, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe the author's feelings are justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's decision to not include them in the wedding party might be due to her own reasons, which are valid. The author's plan to stop contact after this could be a reaction to being excluded. However, not attending the wedding might be seen as cutting off contact preemptively, which could be harsh. \n\nThe author is hurt and feels slighted. While it's understandable to feel that way, the decision to not attend might be seen as a response to the friend's actions. However, the friend might have her reasons, like choosing closer current friends. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to attend. It's their choice. If attending is a financial and time burden, they can choose not to. But the question is if they're in the wrong. Since they are making a personal choice based on their feelings and circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that attending is important for maintaining the friendship, even if it's one-sided. However, the author is planning to cut contact regardless, so maybe they're already deciding to end the friendship. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on their own feelings and the friend's actions. They might not be in the wrong, but it's a sensitive situation. The answer could be B (no), because attending a wedding isn't mandatory unless there's a prior agreement. The author has the right to prioritize their feelings and time, especially if the friendship is already strained. However, some might say they should attend to be supportive. But since they are choosing not to attend due to personal reasons, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
