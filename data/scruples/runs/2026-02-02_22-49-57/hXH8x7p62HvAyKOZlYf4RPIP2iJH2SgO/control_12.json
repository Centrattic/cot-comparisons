I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the user found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was surprising because they expected to be told first. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood friend for the role. The user still assumed they'd be a bridesmaid but now realizes they aren't part of the wedding party at all. They're hurt but understand it's the friend's choice. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they feel it's not worth the effort and expense, especially since they're distancing themselves from the friend anyway.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the hurt feelings from not being included as expected, the financial and time commitment, and the decision to not attend. The user is conflicted but also wants to end the one-sided friendship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, even if you're not in the party. But there are exceptions. If someone is not part of the wedding party and the relationship has become distant, some might argue it's okay to skip. However, weddings are significant events, and not attending can be seen as cutting someone off, even if the friendship is already fading.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions they plan to distance themselves further after this. They're not attending because they feel the friendship is one-sided. The financial aspect is a factor, but they acknowledge it's not a major hardship. So, they're making a choice based on their feelings about the friendship.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often considers intentions and whether someone is being unreasonable. The user's hurt is valid. They were close for 15 years, but the friend drifted. The user isn't in the wedding party and is passing up the chance to be there. But maybe the user is within their rights to prioritize their feelings and resources. On the other hand, weddings are big events, and not attending might be hurtful.\n\nBut the user is choosing not to attend because of the exclusion and their decision to end the friendship. They're not ignoring the wedding entirely\u2014they're making a conscious choice based on their current relationship status. So, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong). They have a valid reason for not attending, and they were already planning to distance themselves. The friend's actions might have contributed to the user's decision. The user isn't necessarily at fault for choosing their own peace of mind and not attending a wedding where they feel excluded.\n"
