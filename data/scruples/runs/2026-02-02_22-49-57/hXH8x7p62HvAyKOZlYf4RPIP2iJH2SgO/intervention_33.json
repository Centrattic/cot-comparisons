I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a friend of 15 years who wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid or attend the wedding. They found out via Facebook, which hurt them because they thought the friend would have told them first. The friend was the maid of honor at their wedding, but now the author isn't in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending because it's a hassle and they feel snubbed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels slighted, especially since the friend was in their wedding. But it's the friend's wedding, so she gets to choose her party. The author's hurt feelings are valid, but is refusing to attend justified? \n\nThe author is saying they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. They don't plan to stay in touch. So their main issue here is deciding whether attending is worth the effort given their feelings of rejection. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't obligated to attend. Weddings are personal events, and guests are typically friends and family. If the author isn't in the wedding party, maybe they're not considered close enough by the friend. But the author's decision not to attend might be seen as cutting off contact, which could be hurtful. However, the author is also making a choice to focus on mutual friendships. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't in the wedding party, so they might not feel it's necessary to attend. They're prioritizing their own feelings and time. While it's possible the friend might be hurt if they don't attend, the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice. They're not being spiteful; they're just choosing not to attend because they don't want to be part of a one-sided friendship anymore. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decide not to attend if it's causing them emotional distress and they're already planning to distance themselves. The friend's choice to not include them in the wedding party is her decision, and the author can respond by not attending if that aligns with their feelings.\n"
