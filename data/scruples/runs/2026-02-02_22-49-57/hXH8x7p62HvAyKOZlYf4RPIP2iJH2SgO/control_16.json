I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The friend is a 15-year friend, but they drifted apart. The author was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago, but now the friend chose another best friend for that role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around attending weddings. Generally, people attend weddings of close friends even if they aren't part of the wedding party, especially if they've been friends for 15 years. But the author is hurt and feels it's a one-sided friendship now. They also mention not wanting to go because it's an expense and effort, but it's not a major hardship.\n\nThe key points are the emotional hurt, the expectation of being a bridesmaid, and the decision not to attend. The friend didn't inform them about the wedding first, which adds to the hurt. The author feels it's not worth the effort without being in the wedding party.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding isn't a requirement. The friend's choice to include others in the wedding party is her right, but it's understandable the author is hurt. However, the author's decision not to attend is a personal choice. They might be cutting ties, which is their prerogative. The friend's mistake was not informing them first and not including them in the wedding party despite the long friendship. But the author isn't obligated to attend. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). They have a valid reason to feel hurt and decide not to attend. The friend might be at fault for not considering the author's feelings, but the author isn't wrong for not going.\n"
