I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend getting married and the author not being asked to be in the wedding party, leading them to consider not attending.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook instead of being told first. That's a red flag. Close friends usually share such big news directly. Then, the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author was hurt but tried to understand, recognizing they'd drifted apart. Still, they expected to be a bridesmaid, but now they realize they're not even in the wedding party at all.\n\nThe author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They mention the costs and time involved, but it's not a major hardship. The key here is whether the author is obligated to attend just because they're a friend, especially since they're not in the wedding party.\n\nWeddings are typically for the couple's closest friends and family. If you're not part of the wedding party, attending is optional. The friend didn't reach out to the author directly until after the fact, which might indicate they didn't value the author as much as they thought. The author's decision not to attend because they're not part of the wedding party seems reasonable. They're not being selfish; they're prioritizing their feelings and time. Also, they don't plan to stay in contact, which is their choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and to choose where they invest their time and money. The friend's actions were hurtful by not informing them early and not including them in the wedding party, which the author is responding to appropriately.\n"
