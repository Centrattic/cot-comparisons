I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't chosen as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which already hurt her feelings. She thought she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was her maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The author drifted apart over the years but still expected to be a bridesmaid. Now she's not in the wedding party at all. She's hurt but understands it's the friend's choice.\n\nThe main issue is whether she's wrong for not attending. She's considering the cost (plane, hotel, time off) and the emotional aspect. She feels the friendship is one-sided now and wants to focus on other friends.\n\nHmm. Attending a wedding is a personal choice. While it's customary to attend, especially for a long-term friend, the author is justifying her decision based on her feelings. She's not in the wedding party, which might make attending less necessary. But some might argue that attending out of respect is important regardless.\n\nThe key factors are the friendship's current state and the author's feelings. If they've drifted apart, maybe the friendship isn't as strong. The author is not attending to avoid embarrassment and isn't interested in a one-sided relationship. \n\nI think it's her right to choose not to attend. The friend made her choices for the wedding party, and the author is respecting that it's her day. Plus, the author is being honest about her feelings and moving on. So, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
