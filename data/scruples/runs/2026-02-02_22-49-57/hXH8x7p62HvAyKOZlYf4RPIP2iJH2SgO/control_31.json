I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being chosen as a bridesmaid. The author has been friends with their friend for over 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. The author thought they would be the maid of honor here, but the friend chose another childhood friend. The author is hurt but understands the drift. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding since they aren't in the party, and they mention not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. People often attend for support and celebration. However, the author is hurt and feels slighted. They might be using the attendance as leverage to show disapproval of not being a bridesmaid. \n\nThe friend didn't inform the author first, which is a point of contention. The author was surprised by the Facebook post. The friend might have drifted apart, but the author still expected to be a bridesmaid. The author is now considering not attending because of the hurt feelings. \n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? The author is making a point about the friendship being one-sided. They plan to cut contact after, so not attending could be a final act. However, not attending a close friend's wedding without a valid reason might be seen as a breach of social etiquette, even if the author is hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to prioritize their feelings. They have a valid reason for being hurt and might not want to attend a stressful event. The decision to not attend could be a way to protect their emotions. \n\nThe key points are the expectation of being a bridesmaid versus the reality, the drift in the friendship, and the author's feelings. The question is whether not attending is wrong. Socially, it's expected, but emotionally, the author has valid reasons. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between social expectations and personal feelings. Since the author is using non-attendance as a reaction to the slight, some might say they're in the wrong for prioritizing feelings over the friendship. Others might empathize with the hurt and understand the decision. But AITA often considers social norms, so maybe the author is wrong. But maybe not, if the friendship was already drifting. \n\nHmm. The friend didn't reach out to the author, which is a problem. The author was surprised by the Facebook post, which might indicate the friend didn't value their relationship enough to inform them directly. In that case, the author's hurt is justified, and not attending could be a reasonable response. \n\nSo maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for feeling hurt, and the friendship's decline is mutual. Not attending is a way to set boundaries.\n"
