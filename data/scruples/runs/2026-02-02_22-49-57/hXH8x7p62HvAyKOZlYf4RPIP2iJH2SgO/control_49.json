I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe friend has known the author for over 15 years, and the author was surprised when they found out about the wedding via Facebook. They thought the friend would have told them first. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their own wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, a childhood best friend. The author was hurt but thought they'd still be a bridesmaid. However, when they saw the wedding party list, the author wasn't included at all. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and not attending would save them the hassle and embarrassment. They also mention not wanting to maintain a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions: Not telling the author first and not including her in the wedding party. The author felt this was hurtful, which is understandable. The friend might have had reasons for not including her, maybe they did drift apart, but the way she found out (through Facebook) and not being informed first could be seen as dismissive.\n\nOn the author's side: They're considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party. The question is whether attending is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. Typically, weddings are events where friends and family are expected to attend, regardless of being in the wedding party. The author is making a choice based on their feelings of being slighted. But is it reasonable to skip a friend's wedding because you weren't in the wedding party?\n\nThere's the aspect of the cost and effort involved. The author mentions it's not a major hardship, but they don't think it's worth it. That's a personal decision, but some might argue that attending is important for the friend's day, regardless of being in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing their own feelings.\n\nThe author also plans to cut off contact after this, which could be a factor. If they feel the friendship is one-sided and not worth maintaining, then not attending might be a way to set boundaries. But is that the right approach?\n\nFrom a social norm perspective, attending a friend's wedding is usually expected unless there are extenuating circumstances. Not attending because you're not in the wedding party might be seen as petty, but if the friendship was already strained, maybe it's a reasonable decision.\n\nAnother angle: Did the friend do something wrong by not including the author? If they drifted apart, maybe the friend felt closer to others. But the initial surprise and lack of communication might have been a mistake. However, the author is focusing on their own feelings here.\n\nSo, the author's decision to not attend is a personal choice. Whether they're in the wrong depends on societal expectations versus personal feelings. If the author feels they're not valued, maybe they're justified. But if attending is a social expectation, they might be seen as in the wrong.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is making a choice based on their own hurt feelings and the state of the friendship. While not attending might be seen as cutting ties, the author is acknowledging that the friendship might be one-sided. Since they're not in the wedding party, the cost and effort might not be worth it. However, some might argue that a long-time friend's wedding is still important to attend regardless. But given the context of drifting apart and the author's decision to end the friendship, maybe it's not wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're prioritizing their feelings and recognizing the friendship's decline. It's their choice to make, and they're not obligated to attend just because it's a friend's wedding if they feel disrespected.\n"
