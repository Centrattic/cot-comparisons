I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the writer and their friend have been close for over 15 years. The friend found out about her wedding via Facebook, which the writer felt was unexpected since they thought they would be told first. The writer assumed they'd be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend for that role. The writer then realized they weren't in the wedding party at all, which hurt their feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the friendship dynamics. The writer expected to be informed first, maybe even assumed a role in the wedding party, but the friend didn't include them. The writer is now considering not attending the wedding because of being excluded, which is a big decision since it's a significant event. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. In many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation, especially for long-term friends. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is seen as a sign of support. However, the writer feels slighted and is considering not attending as a reaction to being excluded. \n\nBut is the writer at fault? They might feel the friend was inconsiderate by not informing them first or including them in the wedding party. However, the friend's right to choose her wedding party is also important. The writer's decision not to attend could be seen as a passive-aggressive response, potentially burning a bridge in the friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer has the right to their feelings. If the friendship has been drifting, maybe the writer's priorities are shifting. The friend's actions might have contributed to the drift. The writer might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being by not attending a wedding that feels one-sided.\n\nSo, the analysis hinges on cultural expectations versus personal feelings. If the writer is choosing not to attend because of hurt feelings, some might say they're overreacting, while others might support their right to set boundaries. However, in most social contexts, attending a friend's wedding despite not being in the party is expected unless there's a valid reason (like distance, cost, etc.). The writer is using not being in the party as the reason, which is more about personal feelings than practicality. \n\nTherefore, the writer might be in the wrong because attending the wedding is a basic courtesy, even if they're not in the party. Cutting off contact entirely might be too harsh. But if the friendship was already drifting, maybe it's a mutual issue. However, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely B (No), because the friend's actions might have been hurtful, and the writer is within their rights to prioritize their feelings. But I need to check common AITA responses. Often, people are advised to attend weddings unless there's a good reason. So maybe AITA would say the writer is in the wrong. Hmm. Need to balance both perspectives.\n"
