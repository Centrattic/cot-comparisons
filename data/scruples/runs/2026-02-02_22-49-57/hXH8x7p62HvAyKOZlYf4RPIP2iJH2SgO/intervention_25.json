I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for considering not attending a friend's wedding because she wasn't made a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the author and the friend have been close for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago, which might lead the author to expect a similar role here. However, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author felt hurt but understood the drift. Then, upon seeing the wedding party list, realized she's not included at all. The author is considering not attending the wedding because of this exclusion, even though attending would involve some costs and effort. She's also thinking about cutting off contact afterward.\n\nThe key points here are: expectation of being a bridesmaid due to past roles, feeling slighted by not being included, and the decision to not attend based on that. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's a big deal to miss a close friend's wedding, it's also understandable that the author might feel hurt. However, weddings are the couple's choice regarding their attendants. Even if the author was hurt, not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend, which could be considered harsh. But the author justifies it by saying she doesn't want a one-sided friendship and plans to cut contact anyway.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is reasonable. While attending a wedding is a social expectation, the author has a legitimate reason for feeling excluded. If she's not in the wedding party, maybe she feels less obligated. However, not attending could be hurtful. But the user says they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. Maybe the author is justified in prioritizing her own feelings here. \n\nIn AITA terms, the friend might have been wrong for not including the author in the wedding party, but the author's choice not to attend is a personal decision. Since the author is standing by her decision and isn't forcing it on the friend, maybe she's not the asshole. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
