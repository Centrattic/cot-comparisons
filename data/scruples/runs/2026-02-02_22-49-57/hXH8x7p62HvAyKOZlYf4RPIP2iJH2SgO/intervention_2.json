I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being included in the wedding party. The author is a 15-year friend who was surprised she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid, especially since she was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. She found out via Facebook, then later learned the maid of honor was another childhood friend. She felt hurt but understood they'd drifted. Now, the friend's wedding party includes people she hasn't been close to lately, and the author is considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party, even though it's not a huge hardship.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't inform her about the wedding first, which is a red flag. The author was probably expecting to be in the wedding party given their history. The fact that the friend didn't reach out first and instead posted on Facebook shows a lack of communication. The author's hurt feelings are valid. The friend might have drifted apart, but that doesn't excuse not including her in the wedding party, especially since it's a significant event. The author is not obligated to attend if she feels disrespected. The cost and effort are factors, but the main issue is the emotional impact. The author is choosing to focus on friendships that are mutual. That's a reasonable decision. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
