I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The author was surprised they weren't told first, thought they'd be maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor before. Then found out another friend was chosen, and now they're not even in the wedding party. They're considering not attending because they feel hurt and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The main points are: the friend didn't tell her first, she assumed a role, but wasn't chosen. She's hurt but trying to be understanding. Now she's thinking of skipping the wedding, which is a big commitment for her. She's also planning not to stay in contact after.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're not in the wedding party, it's common to attend for the friend. However, the author feels it's not worth the effort and is moving on. That's her right. But maybe there's an expectation to attend despite not being a bridesmaid? Or maybe the friend's actions (not telling her first, not including her) justify her decision. \n\nThe key here is whether attending is expected. Some might say that even if you're not in the party, attending is polite. Others might agree that if you're excluded and hurt, it's okay to not attend. The author is prioritizing her own feelings and moving on, which isn't necessarily wrong. She's not cutting off all contact, just not attending and not staying in touch. \n\nThe answer might hinge on the depth of the friendship. Since it's 15 years, maybe she's expected to attend. But the friend didn't reach out to her first, which is a red flag. The author's hurt is valid. Deciding not to attend because of the emotional impact isn't wrong. She's choosing her own well-being. So the answer is B (No).\n"
