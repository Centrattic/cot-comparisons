I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend getting married, and the author not being invited as a bridesmaid, leading to the question of whether it's okay to not attend the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend didn't inform the author about the wedding until they saw it on Facebook, which the author found surprising. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor and didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author is hurt and considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the cost and emotional effort, especially planning to cut ties afterward.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the expectations in friendships and weddings. Friends often have certain expectations, especially when they've been close for years. The author felt wronged because they weren't informed first and expected to be in the wedding party. The friend's decision to include others not recently close might indicate a shift in relationships. The author's decision to not attend and distance themselves could be seen as a response to feeling undervalued. \n\nHowever, weddings are the couple's event, and the bride chooses her bridal party. The author might be overreacting, but their feelings are valid. The question is about right and wrong. Is it wrong to not attend because you're not in the wedding party? \n\nIn some social norms, attending a close friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the party. But others might argue that if the friendship has become one-sided or the person feels excluded, it's okay to prioritize their feelings. The author is willing to bear some costs (travel, time off) but sees the emotional cost as higher. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are based on their feelings of being excluded and choosing to distance themselves, it's a personal decision. However, not attending a close friend's wedding without a valid reason (like distance, work, etc.) might be seen as inconsiderate. But in this case, the author is hurt and plans to end the friendship, which adds context. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has a right to their feelings and it's understandable they want to focus on reciprocal friendships. The friend's actions might be the root cause of the hurt, so the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend.\n"
