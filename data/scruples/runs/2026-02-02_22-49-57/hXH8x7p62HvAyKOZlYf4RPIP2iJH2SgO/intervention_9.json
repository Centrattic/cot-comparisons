I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend of their friend. The friend didn't tell them first about the wedding, which already seems like a possible oversight. The author assumed they'd be a bridesmaid, especially since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and now the author isn't in the wedding party at all. They're hurt but understand drifting apart. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and find the cost and effort not worth it. They also don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's break down the factors. \n\nWeddings are typically social events where close friends are expected to attend, even if they're not in the wedding party. However, not being in the wedding party can be a sensitive issue. The friend didn't communicate first, which is a red flag. The author was blindsided and not treated with the respect they might have expected. The author is hurt and feels the friendship has become one-sided. They're not attending because they don't want to invest time and money without being a part of the event, which could be seen as a justified reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, friends often attend each other's weddings out of respect and support, regardless of their role. The author's decision might be seen as cutting off contact completely, which could be harsh. But if the friend has already drifted away, maybe the author is right to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are the lack of communication from the friend, the drifting relationship, and the author's feelings of being undervalued. The author isn't being vindictive; they're making a choice based on their hurt feelings and the current state of the friendship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while attending a friend's wedding is customary, the author's decision to not attend because they're not in the wedding party isn't inherently wrong. They have valid reasons for feeling slighted and aren't obligated to attend. The friend's failure to inform them of the wedding and not including them in the wedding party could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They're making a decision based on their own feelings and the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
