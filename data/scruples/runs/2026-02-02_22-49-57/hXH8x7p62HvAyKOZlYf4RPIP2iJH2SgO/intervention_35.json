I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they're not a bridesmaid. They were friends for 15 years, and the friend was their maid of honor. Now, the friend chose someone else as maid of honor, and the person feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. They found out they're not in the wedding party at all, so they're considering not attending. They mention it's a few states away, so it's not easy, and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. First, the friend didn't tell them first about the wedding, which is a red flag. Then, they expected to be in the wedding party since they reciprocated in the past. But the friend chose others, possibly closer ones. The person is hurt, which is valid. Attending a wedding is a big deal, especially when you're not in the bridal party. They might feel it's a one-sided friendship now, given the lack of communication and inclusion.\n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? Well, weddings are important events, and not attending could be seen as cutting off ties. However, they're not in the bridal party, so maybe they don't feel obligated. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own feelings and focus on other relationships. It's their decision, even if it might hurt the friend. But maybe they should consider the friend's feelings as well. However, the friend didn't include them in the planning, so maybe the author is justified in their feelings. I think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're acknowledging the hurt but making a choice based on their own boundaries. So answer B.\n"
