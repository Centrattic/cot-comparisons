I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The friend is getting married, and the author felt snubbed when they found out they weren't a bridesmaid. They were expecting to be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor two years ago. Now, the author is considering skipping the wedding because they're hurt and not part of the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to think about social norms. Usually, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is considered polite. Weddings are major events, and not showing up might be seen as disrespectful. But the author has reasons: they feel hurt, it's a financial and time commitment, and they want to focus on mutual friendships. \n\nThe friend didn't tell the author first, which is a point in their favor. Maybe that was a mistake on the friend's part. The author tried to stay positive, understanding that the friend might have drifted. But now they're deciding not to attend, which could be seen as cutting off contact entirely. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend's actions might have been hurtful, and the author has the right to prioritize their own feelings. However, weddings are significant events where guests are expected to attend regardless of being in the party. Skipping might be hurtful to the friend. But the author isn't saying they won't attend at all\u2014they're weighing the value of the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to attend. It's their choice, but the act of not attending might be seen as a passive-aggressive response. However, if the author feels the friendship is one-sided, maybe it's a valid decision. \n\nThe key here is that the author is not the one who invited the others without them; the friend made the choices. The author is reacting to being excluded. While weddings typically expect attendance, the author's feelings are valid. So, are they in the wrong? Maybe not. They're making a personal choice based on their emotions and the state of the friendship. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
