I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. The friend is getting married in a few months, and the author found out through Facebook. They had a conversation with their friend about the wedding plans, assuming they would be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. Then the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor, and the author later realized they aren't in the wedding party at all.\n\nThe author's feelings are hurt but they understand it's the friend's day. However, since they're not part of the wedding party and it's not a major hardship to attend (but requires some effort like plane tickets, hotel, time off), they're considering not attending. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact after this. The question is whether they are in the wrong (AITA) for not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around attending weddings. Generally, even if you're not part of the wedding party, attending is expected if you're close friends. But the author is feeling hurt and maybe the friendship has changed. They mention drifting apart in the last few years. So maybe the author is still a close friend but the friend chose others for the wedding party. \n\nThe author didn't confront the friend about not being included, but they found out through Facebook. The friend did respond to their message and talked about the wedding plans, which could imply that the author is still expected to attend. However, the author is choosing not to attend due to hurt feelings and not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize your own feelings? On one hand, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and not attending might be seen as self-centered. On the other hand, the friendship has changed, and the author feels undervalued. The key here is that the author is not attending because they're not part of the wedding party and are upset about it. They're also planning to cut contact, so maybe they see this as the end of the friendship. \n\nBut if they were close friends for 15 years, even if they've drifted, attending the wedding might still be a kind gesture. However, the author might feel that their friend didn't communicate properly\u2014like announcing the wedding on Facebook instead of telling them first. That's a valid point. The friend's actions might have already strained the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong if they feel the friendship isn't mutual anymore. They are allowed to make a choice based on their own emotions. The friend might be in the wrong for not informing them earlier or not including them in the wedding party. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting on their own feelings and the friend's lack of communication and changed priorities.\n"
