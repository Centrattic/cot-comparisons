I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 15-year friend who wasn't invited to the wedding party of her friend. The friend was the maid of honor at the user's wedding two years ago, but now the user isn't even a bridesmaid. The user is hurt and considering not attending the wedding because she's not part of the wedding party. She's thinking about whether she's in the wrong (AITA) for not going.\n\nFirst, the user's feelings are valid. Being excluded from a close friend's wedding party can be hurtful, especially given their history. The friend didn't inform the user initially, which added to the hurt. The user had a right to expect some level of inclusion, given their past relationship.\n\nThe friend's actions might be explained by drifting apart over the years, but that doesn't make the exclusion less painful. The user is considering not attending, which is her choice. The cost and effort involved (plane ticket, hotel, time off) are factors she's weighing against her emotional investment in the friendship.\n\nThe key here is the user's decision to not attend. Is she in the wrong for doing that? Well, attending a wedding is a social norm, but it's not a requirement. Since the user is not part of the wedding party, her attendance might be less expected. The user also mentions wanting to focus on mutual friendships, indicating that she sees the relationship as one-sided now. \n\nThe user isn't avoiding the situation entirely; she's just choosing not to attend the wedding. She's still staying in contact briefly but plans to cut ties afterward. That shows she's processing her feelings and making a decision that's best for her emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. She's acting based on her feelings and circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
