I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friendship dynamics. The friend is getting married after 15 years, but the writer found out on Facebook, which might be a red flag. The writer assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The writer feels hurt but understands the drift. Then, the writer realizes they aren't in the wedding party at all, even though two others in the party aren't close either. Now, the writer is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and want to focus on friends who value them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions and the writer's response. The friend didn't inform the writer first, which might indicate a lack of consideration. The writer's friend didn't include them in the wedding party despite their history, which could be due to the drift or other reasons. The writer's decision not to attend is based on personal hurt feelings and a desire to not be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Attending a wedding is a personal choice. While it's customary to attend for close friends, it's not a requirement. The writer is experiencing hurt and feeling undervalued. The friend's actions (not informing first, not including in the wedding party) contributed to the writer's feelings. The writer isn't being unkind by not attending; they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. So, the answer is B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
