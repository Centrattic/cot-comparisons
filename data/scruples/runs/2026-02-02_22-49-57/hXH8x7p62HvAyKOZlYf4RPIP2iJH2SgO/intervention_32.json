I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with the bride for 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which already seems like a missed opportunity for the bride to include them. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the bride was their maid of honor in their wedding. But the bride chose someone else, maybe because they've drifted apart. The author is hurt but tries to understand. Now, when the author sees the wedding party list and isn't there, they're considering not attending the wedding.\n\nThe main points here are: the author's feelings of exclusion, the effort and cost involved in attending, and the decision to cut ties. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions. The author feels it's one-sided now, and wants to focus on other friends. The bride didn't communicate well, which is a problem on her end. However, the author is choosing not to attend, which might be seen as cutting off the friendship. But maybe justified given the lack of communication and inclusion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the bride didn't reach out, used Facebook to announce the wedding, didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author's decision might stem from feeling undervalued. Attending a wedding is a big commitment, especially over distance. If the author feels the friendship is one-sided and isn't worth the effort, maybe they're not wrong. The bride's actions contributed to the situation. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
