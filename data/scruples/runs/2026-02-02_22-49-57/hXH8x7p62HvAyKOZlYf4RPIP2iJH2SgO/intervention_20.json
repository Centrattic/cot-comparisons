I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been friends with the bride for over 15 years. The bride didn't tell them about the wedding first, which the author found surprising. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor at the bride's wedding two years ago. But the bride chose someone else, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. Now they're considering not attending because they're hurt and see it as a one-sided friendship.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the author had versus the reality. The author expected to be a bridesmaid, maybe even the maid of honor, given their history. When that didn't happen, they felt slighted. They also mention not wanting to attend because of the financial and time costs, but the main issue is the emotional aspect.\n\nThe bride didn't communicate her decision well. She found out through Facebook, which might have been a mistake. Also, she didn't explain why she chose other people for the wedding party. The author feels embarrassed and hurt, which is a valid emotional response. They're not attending to save money or time; they're making a statement about the friendship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is generally expected, especially if you're close. But that's a general rule. In this case, the friendship has drifted, and the bride didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author is questioning the value of the friendship, which is a personal choice. They're not obligated to attend if they feel disrespected or hurt.\n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate by not attending if they're not in the wedding party. Weddings are the bride's choice in terms of who's in the party. The author's decision to not attend is a reaction to feeling excluded, which is understandable. The financial aspect is a minor point compared to the emotional one. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They have valid reasons rooted in feelings of exclusion and the state of their friendship. The answer should be B.\n"
