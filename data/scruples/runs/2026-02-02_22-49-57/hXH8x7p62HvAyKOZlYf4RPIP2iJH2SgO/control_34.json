I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell the author about the wedding in person, which is a bit odd given their 15-year friendship. Then, the author expected to be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author feels hurt. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and they feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and friendship dynamics. The author had an expectation based on past behavior (their friend being the maid of honor), but the friend didn't reciprocate. Not being invited to the wedding party can be hurtful, especially if you've been close. However, weddings are typically the couple's choice for their day, so maybe the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nThe author is also thinking about the cost and effort of traveling. They're planning to cut ties after this. The question is whether it's wrong to not attend. In many cases, attending a friend's wedding is not mandatory unless you're part of the party. But culturally, there might be an expectation to attend if you're a close friend. However, since the author feels the friendship has been one-sided, maybe they're justified in prioritizing their own feelings.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has every right to set boundaries. If the friendship has become one-sided, and the friend didn't communicate properly, it's reasonable for the author to decide not to attend. The wedding is her day, but the author's feelings are valid. Not attending doesn't make them wrong.\n"
