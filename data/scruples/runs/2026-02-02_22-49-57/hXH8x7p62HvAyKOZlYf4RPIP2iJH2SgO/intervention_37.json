I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the friend of 15 years didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which is a bit odd. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But then the friend chose someone else, and the author is hurt but still thought they'd be a bridesmaid. When they realized they weren't in the wedding party at all, they're considering not attending because it's a hassle and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nWeddings are the host's choice of attendees, so the friend isn't obligated to invite the author, especially if they're not in the wedding party. But the author is close, and the friend didn't inform them initially, which might have been a mistake. However, the author's decision to not attend because of not being in the wedding party could be seen as a bit petty, but it's also about the author's feelings and effort involved. The author is also planning to cut off contact, which might be a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often attend weddings of close friends even if they're not in the wedding party. But if the friendship has been drifting, maybe the author feels it's time to move on. The key points are: the friend's actions (not informing first, choosing others for the wedding party), the author's feelings, and the effort required to attend. The author's reasoning is that it's not worth the effort if the friendship isn't reciprocal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend didn't include them, and the author is prioritizing their own feelings and time, it's understandable. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't obligated to attend, especially if the friendship is already strained and they're not in the wedding party. The friend's actions may have contributed to the author's decision, so the author isn't in the wrong for making a choice based on their hurt feelings and the friendship's state.\n"
