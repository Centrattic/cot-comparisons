I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they aren't a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend who found out about the wedding through Facebook. They were surprised and thought they would be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. The friend chose someone else for the maid of honor, which the author found hurtful but understood due to drifting apart. Then they noticed that even the other bridesmaids aren't close anymore. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship and plans to cut contact afterward. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The core issue is whether attending the wedding is necessary if the author isn't in the wedding party. The author feels hurt by not being included, which is natural. But the friend might have her own reasons for choosing different people. The author is facing the cost and effort of attending but doesn't see the value if their role is just as a guest.\n\nIn many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is seen as a sign of support and respect, even if you aren't in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has been one-sided\u2014like the author feeling they're being excluded\u2014it might be reasonable to prioritize their own feelings. The author isn't refusing the wedding entirely but is questioning if not attending is wrong. \n\nThe key points are the emotional investment of the author, the friend's decision to include others, and the author's choice to not attend to save face. I think the author is justified in their feelings. If the friend didn't communicate properly, that's her fault. The author isn't obligated to attend, especially if they feel the friendship isn't mutual. But maybe some people would argue that attending is still important regardless of the role. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. So the answer should be B.\n"
