I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son, explaining the game's mature content. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, there are age ratings on video games, like the ESRB rating in the US. GTA V has an M (Mature) rating, which is for 17+. The employee mentioned the M rating and the specific content, which is part of their job to inform customers. The mother was concerned after being informed, which shows the employee provided necessary information. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The employee is protecting a child from inappropriate content. The mother might not have been aware of the game's content, so the employee's role in educating her is valid. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing the child's autonomy or not seeing the content as harmful. But the employee's intention was to help the mother make an informed decision, which is a responsible action.\n\nAnother point is the employee's job responsibility. Retail employees are often trained to advise customers on age-appropriate content, especially for minors. By giving accurate details about the game's content, the employee was fulfilling their duty. The mother chose a different game after being informed, which supports the idea that the employee did the right thing.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the employee overstepped by not just stating the rating but going into graphic details. But since the mother asked for more information, providing specifics about torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing is reasonable to convey the game's maturity level. It's about transparency to help the parent decide.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the employee acted ethically and responsibly by informing the parent, thereby helping her avoid a potentially inappropriate purchase. The co-worker's reaction is a personal opinion, but the employee's action aligns with protecting a child's well-being and adhering to their job's expectations.\n"
