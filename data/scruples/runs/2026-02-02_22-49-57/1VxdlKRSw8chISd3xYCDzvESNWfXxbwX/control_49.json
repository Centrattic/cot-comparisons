I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works at Target and helped a mother who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explained the game's content, like the M rating, graphic scenes, and other mature themes, which made the mother decide against buying it. The co-worker was upset, thinking the author was \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means it's for ages 17+. The author was providing accurate information about the game's content, which is a common practice in retail. The mother asked for more details, so the author gave her the info to make an informed decision. Legally, there's no law against sharing content details, and in some places, stores might even be required to inform customers about content ratings.\n\nEthically, the author is acting in what they believe is the best interest of the child. By informing the mother, they're helping her make a responsible choice. The co-worker's complaint is about interference, but the author isn't forced to let someone buy something inappropriate. The author's reasoning is that if their own kids were in that situation, they'd want the same information. That's a valid point about empathy and responsibility.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the co-worker's son has a right to play the game if he's old enough according to the rating. But the mother decided against it based on the info given, so the author's actions led to a positive outcome. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since they provided information and left the decision to the mother, they're not forcing anyone. The mother chose not to buy it, so the author isn't in the wrong. They did their job honestly and ethically.\n"
