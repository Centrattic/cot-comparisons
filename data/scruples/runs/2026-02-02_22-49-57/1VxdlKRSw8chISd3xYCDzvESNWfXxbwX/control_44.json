I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mom buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mom wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is an M-rated game. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset with the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the author thinks they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"M\" rating means. It's for Mature audiences, so it's not suitable for kids under 17. Retail employees are often trained to check the age of the buyer when selling M-rated games. But in this case, the author didn't just inform the parent about the rating\u2014they went into detail about the graphic content. The co-worker thought the author was being too harsh, but the author's reasoning was that they would want the same info if they were a parent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the author provided accurate information about the game's content, which could help the parent make an informed decision. The parent then chose not to buy it, which seems responsible. On the other hand, maybe the author shouldn't have gone into such graphic details, or perhaps they should have just stated the rating and left the decision to the parent. However, the parent asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The author's actions might have been within their job's guidelines, which often include informing customers about content ratings. The co-worker's criticism might be more about not wanting to interfere with a sale, but the author's priority was the parent's right to know.\n\nI think the key points here are the responsibility to inform customers about age-appropriate content and the fact that the parent asked for more details. The author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information that the parent requested, helping them make a decision. The co-worker's reaction might be more about protecting sales rather than the child's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
