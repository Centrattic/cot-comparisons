I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the person who wrote this is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting a mother buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, GTA V has an M rating, which stands for Mature. The author explained that there are graphic scenes like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online features. The mother was concerned after the explanation and decided to buy a different game. The co-worker didn't like that the author stopped the sale, calling it \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want to know the content to make an informed decision. So, they feel they're protecting the child from inappropriate content.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The key points here are the age of the child (9 years old) and the content of the game. GTA V is rated for 17+ in some regions, so selling it to a younger child could be inappropriate. The author provided information that the mother might not have known, helping her make a choice. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to enforce the rating? As an employee, maybe they're supposed to inform customers about the ratings. But did they overstep by discouraging the purchase? The mother was the one making the decision, and the author just gave her the facts. She decided not to buy it after being informed. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be about personal preference, but the author's action was protective. Legally, the store might not stop the sale if the parent is buying it for a minor, but the author's action was to prevent the sale of a game not suitable for the child's age. \n\nSo, the author wasn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help the parent make a responsible decision. The parent chose not to buy it, which was her right. The co-worker's issue is about not letting the child get the game, but the author's action was in line with ethical responsibility towards child welfare.\n"
