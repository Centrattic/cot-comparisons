I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works at Target in electronics and encountered a situation where a mother wanted to buy GTA V for her son. He explained the mature content, leading her to choose a different game. His coworker criticized him, but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9 years old) and the content of GTA V, which is rated M for Mature. The author's intention was to provide accurate information about the game's content so the mother could make an informed decision. He's essentially upholding the ESRB rating by informing her about the graphic elements. \n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, the mother was seeking advice for a game intended for children under 16-18. The author provided necessary details that align with the game's rating, which is meant to warn parents about inappropriate content for minors. His action can be seen as helping the parent make a responsible choice rather than selling a game that's not age-appropriate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not just stating the M rating but going into graphic details. Yet, the primary duty of an employee in this context is to provide accurate information about the product. Since the mother asked for more details, the author was merely fulfilling her request, which led to her not purchasing the game. \n\nThe coworker's criticism seems more about the author \"cockblocking\" the son, implying that the coworker wanted the sale to go through. But the author's priority was the child's well-being, not the sale. The mixed responses from coworkers suggest that while some might agree with the action, others might see it as unnecessary, but the author's main goal was to inform, not dictate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in good faith to inform the mother, respecting the rating system and the parent's right to make an educated decision. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
