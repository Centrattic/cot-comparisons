I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target in electronics and a customer came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the game's content, including the M rating, graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, but the author thought they were just being helpful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was asking for more information, so the author provided the details. The key point here is that the author was giving factual information about the game's content to help the parent make an informed decision. GTA V is rated M for Mature, and the content described aligns with that rating. The author's intention was to prevent the mother from buying a game unsuitable for a child her age.\n\nIn many places, there are laws requiring retailers to follow content ratings, especially for minors. The author's actions might actually be in line with those regulations by informing the parent. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced because the author wasn't enforcing the law themselves but was providing accurate information. The mother made the decision not to buy the game after being informed, which is exactly the scenario the author intended.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not just stating the facts but \"convincing\" the mother not to buy it. But given that the mother asked for more details, the author's role was to provide that info, and the mother made her own choice. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they just gave her the necessary info to decide. The author's perspective is that they'd want the same if they were buying for their own kids, which is a reasonable stance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, followed company policy, and respected the parent's autonomy. The co-worker's reaction seems to be the real issue here. The answer should be B for No.\n"
