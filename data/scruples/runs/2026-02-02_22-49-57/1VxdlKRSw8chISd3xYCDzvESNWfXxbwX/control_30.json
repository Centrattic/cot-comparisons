I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who helped a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old by detailing the game's graphic content. The employee's co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The employee is in the electronics department, a role where they're expected to help customers with purchases. The mother was seeking advice, and the employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which is rated M for mature audiences. The mother then chose a different game. The employee's action seems to be an effort to inform the parent about the game's content, which could include violence, sexual themes, and swearing. \n\nThe key points here are the responsibility to inform customers about product content and the appropriateness of the game for the child's age. The employee isn't forcing the mother to buy or not buy the game; they're giving her the facts to make an informed decision. The mother, upon hearing the details, decides against the purchase, which suggests the employee's information was valuable to her.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly thinking the employee overstepped. However, in a retail setting, employees often provide product information, including content warnings, to help parents make informed choices. The employee is acting as a responsible advisor, not imposing their own views but offering information. \n\nThe ESRB rating already provides content descriptors, but the employee is expanding on that by explaining specific scenes. This is within the bounds of their role to ensure the product is suitable for the customer's needs. There's no indication the employee was rude or forced the decision; they presented the facts and let the mother decide. \n\nPotential arguments against the employee might be that they shouldn't interfere or that they overstepped. However, the employee's action is in line with helping the customer, which is their job. Parents have a right to know about content to make age-appropriate choices. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong here.\n"
