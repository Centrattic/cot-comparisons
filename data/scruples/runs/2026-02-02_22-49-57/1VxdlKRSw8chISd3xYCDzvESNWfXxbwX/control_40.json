I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V, which is rated M for mature audiences. The author explained the M rating and detailed some of the more graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided against buying it and chose another game instead. The co-worker was upset, saying the author was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it. The author is wondering if they were wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author provided information about the game's content, which is part of their job role in electronics, especially when dealing with parents buying for kids. The mother was seeking more information when she asked, so the author's response was in answer to her request. The co-worker's reaction seems to be about the author interfering with a sale, but the author's intention was to inform the parent properly. \n\nFrom a parent's perspective, knowing the content of a game that's rated M is important, especially for a 9-year-old. The author is acting in the interest of the child's well-being by ensuring the parent is fully aware of the content. The ESRB ratings exist to inform consumers, and the author is essentially reinforcing that by explaining the reasons behind the M rating. The co-worker's frustration might be about perceived interference, but the author's actions align with their responsibility to provide accurate information. \n\nHowever, there's a possible angle where the author might be overstepping if they didn't just stick to the facts. But in this case, the mother asked for more details, so the author's detailed explanation was appropriate. The author isn't the parent, but by providing the necessary info, they're helping the parent make an informed decision. There's no indication the author forced the mother to not buy the game; she made the decision herself after being informed. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author shouldn't take it upon themselves to dissuade a customer from purchasing a product unless there's a policy in place. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mother was the one who decided not to buy the game after receiving the information, the author isn't imposing their own values but providing factual data. The co-worker's criticism might stem from a different perspective, but the author's actions were in line with their role as an informed salesperson. \n\nIn summary, the author provided necessary information upon request, helping the parent make an appropriate choice for their child. The author isn't in the wrong here because they were doing their job correctly and responsibly.\n"
