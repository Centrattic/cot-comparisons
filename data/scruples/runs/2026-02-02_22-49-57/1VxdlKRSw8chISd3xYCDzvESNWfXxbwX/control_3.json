I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author works at Target in electronics. A customer (the mother) wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explains the game's M rating, mentioning graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decides against it and buys a different game. The co-worker was annoyed, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The author is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by providing detailed information that led to the mother changing her purchase. Let's consider the responsibilities here. As an employee, part of their job is to provide accurate information about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The ESRB ratings are in place to help parents make informed decisions. The author was following standard practice by explaining the game's content, which could affect whether it's suitable for a child.\n\nHowever, the author might have gone beyond just stating the rating by giving specific, graphic details. But is that really a problem? The mother asked for more information, and the author provided it honestly. Parents need to know the specifics to make a decision that's right for their child. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which seems reasonable. The co-worker's reaction is a social issue among the employees, but the author's actions towards the customer were helpful and responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author have just mentioned the rating and left it at that? Possibly. But the mother asked for more details, so the author was responding to her request. The fact that the mother ended up choosing a different game after being informed suggests that the author's intervention had a positive effect. The author's reasoning\u2014that they would want the same information if purchasing for their own kids\u2014is valid and shows a good intention.\n\nI think the key here is that the author was providing information the customer requested, which is part of their job. The co-worker's complaint is about the author's method, but as long as the information is accurate and the customer wasn't pressured, the author is in the right. The author's actions align with helping parents make informed choices, which is a responsible approach.\n"
