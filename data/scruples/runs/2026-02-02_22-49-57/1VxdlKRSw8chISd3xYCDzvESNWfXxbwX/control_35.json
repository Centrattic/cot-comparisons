I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who works at Target in electronics, helping a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which is rated M (for Mature). The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements, which made the mother decide against buying it.\n\nThe co-worker was upset, saying the author was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it. The author feels conflicted but thinks they were just doing what they would want for their own kids. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by providing detailed information that led the mother to not buy the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of the employee. Their job is to assist customers, which includes informing them about product details. Games have content ratings for a reason, so explaining the M rating and its implications is part of customer service. The mother asked for more information, so the author was responding to her request. The author didn't force her to not buy the game; they provided facts, and the mother made the decision herself.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was being judgmental or overstepping by emphasizing the graphic content. But since the mother was seeking more information, the author's detailed explanation was appropriate. The co-worker's reaction suggests they didn't like the author interfering, but the author's intent was to inform, not to judge. The author also mentions they were doing what they would want for their own kids, which adds a layer of responsibility to protect children from inappropriate content.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't legally responsible, but as an employee, their duty is to provide accurate information. The mother had the autonomy to decide, and the author merely facilitated that. The co-worker's complaint is more about personal opinion rather than the author violating any rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for providing necessary information to help the mother make an informed decision.\n"
