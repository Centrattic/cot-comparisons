I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker is upset, but the author thinks they're helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The employee was helping a customer, explaining the M rating and graphic elements. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase. The co-worker and others are mixed in their reactions. The author's reasoning is that they were informing the parent about content they might not know about, which they'd appreciate if they were in a similar situation.\n\nNow, the key factors here are the employee's duty and the ethical implications. As an employee, their role is to assist customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which includes content like violence, language, and sexual themes. The employee is highlighting these aspects to help the parent make an informed decision. \n\nThe mother was clearly seeking information, so the employee was doing their job by explaining the content. The co-worker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" but the real issue is about appropriateness for a child. The parent's decision to change their purchase indicates that the information was useful. \n\nPotential counterarguments might be that the employee overstepped, but given the age of the child and the game's rating, it's reasonable to warn about content. The employee isn't forcing the sale; they're informing the parent. The ethical stance here is about protecting children from inappropriate content versus a co-worker's dissatisfaction. \n\nIn such scenarios, employees are often encouraged to guide customers away from age-inappropriate products, especially for minors. So, the author isn't in the wrong for doing their job and providing necessary information. The answer should be B.\n"
