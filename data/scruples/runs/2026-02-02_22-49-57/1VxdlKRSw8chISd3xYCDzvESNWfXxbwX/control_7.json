I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target, transferred to a new store, and were helping a customer buy a video game. The customer's 9-year-old son wanted GTA V, which is rated M for Mature. The author explained the M rating and the graphic content, including torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it and chose a different game. The co-worker later mocked the author for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room with mixed responses.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were just doing what they would want if they had kids and weren't informed about the game's content. The key points here are the age of the child (9 years old), the M rating of GTA V (which is 17+), and whether the author overstepped by providing detailed information that convinced the mother to change her decision.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the M rating entails. The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) classifies games, and an M rating is for games with content suitable for ages 17 and older. GTA V has violence, strong language, sexual content, and online interactions that might include inappropriate material. So, selling an M-rated game to a 9-year-old is against the guidelines. Retail employees are actually encouraged to question the age of the buyer when an M-rated game is being purchased, to prevent underage sales.\n\nIn this case, the mother was buying the game for her 9-year-old, but the author didn't just mention the M rating\u2014they went into more graphic details about the content. The co-worker's reaction suggests that while some might think the author was being helpful, others might see it as overstepping, especially if the mother was aware of the rating but wanted more info. However, the mother did ask for more information after the author mentioned the M rating. The author provided that info, and the mother then made a decision based on that. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to detail the graphic scenes. The author's intent was to inform the parent so they could make a responsible choice, which seems like a valid reason. But the co-worker's criticism implies that maybe the author shouldn't have been so involved in the decision, perhaps by giving more details than necessary. However, considering the age of the child and the M rating, the author was acting in line with best practices to prevent underage exposure to inappropriate content. The mother was given the information and chose to not buy the game, which is the desired outcome. \n\nThe mixed coworker responses don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The main issue is that the author went above and beyond by explaining specific graphic elements, but they were still providing relevant information that the parent asked for. Since the parent was informed and made a responsible choice, the author's actions were probably justified. The law and store policies likely support ensuring that minors don't get games rated for older audiences. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
