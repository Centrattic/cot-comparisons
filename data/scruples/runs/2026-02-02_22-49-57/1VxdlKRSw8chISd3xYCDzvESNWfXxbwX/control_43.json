I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation involves the author working at Target and providing detailed info about the game's content. The mother was concerned after the explanation and changed her purchase. The co-worker felt it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to inform the mother about the game's mature content, like torture and sexual themes. The M rating is there for a reason, and the author is acting within their role to provide accurate info. But the question is whether the author overstepped by being too graphic. \n\nOn one hand, the author is helping the mother make an informed decision, which is responsible. Parents should know what they're buying for their kids. On the other hand, maybe the author could have been less detailed, but the mother asked for more info. The author's actions led to the mother making a better choice, which seems positive. The co-worker's reaction is about feeling the author blocked a sale, but the author's priority was the child's well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information in a helpful way, especially since the parent asked. The author's actions are protective and responsible. The answer is B.\n"
