I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they work at Target in electronics, and a customer came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating and gave more details about the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mom then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset and called it \"cockblocking,\" and other coworkers had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole here. The key here is whether providing detailed information about the game's content to help a parent make an informed decision is appropriate or overstepping. \n\nFirst, the author mentioned the game's M rating, which is a standard rating system meant to inform parents about content. The mother asked for more information, so the author provided it. That seems like a reasonable response. The parent then used that info to decide against buying it, which is her right as a parent. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was too graphic in their description, even if the mother asked. But the mother explicitly asked for more details, so the author answered truthfully. The main job role here is to assist customers, which includes giving accurate information about products. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is interesting. They seem to think the author was being a \"dick\" and \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were buying for their own kids. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is acting in the child's best interest by informing the parent about potentially harmful content. The parent is the one who decides whether the child can handle it. The author isn't forcing the parent to do anything; they're just providing necessary information. \n\nOn the flip side, could there be a point where providing too much detail crosses the line? Maybe, but since the parent asked, and GTA V is known for its mature content, it's part of the job to explain it. The author isn't the parent's child, so they have no right to make the purchase for the parent. \n\nIn conclusion, the author was doing their job by providing accurate and detailed content information, which the parent requested. The parent made an informed decision, so the author isn't in the wrong. The co-worker's criticism is misplaced here.\n"
