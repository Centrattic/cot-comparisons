I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer (the mother) wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explains the game's M rating, mentions graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decides not to buy it. The co-worker was with the author and later criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the author's intention was to inform the parent.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9) and the content of the game. GTA V is rated M, which is for mature audiences. The parent was seeking advice because she didn't know much about the game. The author provided the necessary information, which led the parent to make an informed decision. \n\nI should consider if there's any policy against this. Retail employees are often trained to explain game ratings and content. The author isn't forcing the parent to not buy it, just providing facts. The parent had the final say. The co-worker's complaint is about the author being too direct, but the author's action seems protective and responsible.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have given such detailed info, but the parent asked for more. Also, the parent is the one who decides, not the employee. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're helping the parent make a choice, not taking away the purchase right. The parent was informed and chose not to buy. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They were doing their job by providing accurate information to help the parent make a decision. The co-worker's reaction is just a difference in opinion, but the author acted responsibly.\n"
