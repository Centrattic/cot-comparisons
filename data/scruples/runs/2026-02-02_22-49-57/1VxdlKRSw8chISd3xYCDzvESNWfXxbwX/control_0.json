I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker helping a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a Target employee who explained the mature content of GTA V to a mother. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The coworker and others reacted mixed, but the author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. The author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is their job when a customer asks. The mother was seeking advice, so giving her the details to make an informed decision seems appropriate. The author's coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but that might be more about the coworker's preference rather than the mother's best interest. \n\nAlso, the mother was naive about the game, so the author helped her make a responsible choice. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were buying for their kids. That's a valid point. \n\nBut maybe there's a line where the employee shouldn't push their own opinion. However, the author didn't force the sale; they provided info and the mother made the choice. The author didn't violate any rules by giving factual content details. \n\nIn retail, employees are often encouraged to inform customers about product content, especially for parental guidance. The author's actions align with that. The coworkers' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision, which is their responsibility.\n"
