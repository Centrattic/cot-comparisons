I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The situation is that the author works at Target in electronics and a customer asked for GTA V. The author explained the M rating, mentioned the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother decided against it, and the co-worker was upset about \"cockblocking\" the kid. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was seeking information to make an informed decision. The author provided accurate details about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. The mother then made a choice based on that info, which seems responsible. The author's intention was to inform, not to make a judgment, but rather to help the parent decide. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is a point of contention. The author isn't in the wrong for doing their job, which includes advising on content. The mother had the right to know, especially since the child is under the recommended age. The author's action aligns with protecting a child from inappropriate content. However, maybe the way the information was presented could have been more tactful, but the intent was good. \n\nIn many places, stores are required to inform customers about content ratings. The author's action supports the parent's responsibility. The co-worker might feel it's their job to sell, but the parent's decision is about the child's well-being. The author isn't forcing the mother to do anything; they're providing facts. So, the answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong) because the author was helping the parent make an informed choice, which is a responsible action.\n"
