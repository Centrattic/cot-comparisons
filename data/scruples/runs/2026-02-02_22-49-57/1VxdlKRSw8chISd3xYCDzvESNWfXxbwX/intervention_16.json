I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content in GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer, a mother, wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother decided not to buy it after the explanation. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and other coworkers had mixed reactions. The author feels they were just doing what they would want for their own kids, providing necessary info.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't, but they're curious for my take. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider several angles. Legally, there's no law against informing a customer about product content. Ethically, it's about protecting a child from inappropriate content versus respecting the customer's choice. The mother was the one making the purchase decision for her child. She asked for more information, so the author provided it. The author's intention was to help the mother make an informed decision, which seems responsible. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by influencing the purchase, but since the mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed, maybe the author's role was just to inform, not persuade. But the author did explain the content, which is standard practice. Employees in electronics sections often give such advice. The co-worker's reaction might be more about personal annoyance than a valid ethical concern. The key point is that the author provided factual information that the customer requested. The mother used that info to make her choice. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were being responsible and helpful, not forcing the decision. Therefore, answer B (no).\n"
