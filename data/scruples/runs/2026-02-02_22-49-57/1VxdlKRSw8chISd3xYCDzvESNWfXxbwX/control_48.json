I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they work at Target in electronics, and when a mother came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, the author explained the M rating and the graphic content. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker called it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's actions. GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which means it's intended for ages 17+. The game has violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother's son is 9, which is way under the recommended age. The author provided the necessary information about the content, which is part of their job, especially in helping customers make informed decisions. \n\nThe author's co-worker criticized him for \"cockblocking,\" but the main issue is whether the author overstepped. The mother asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which seems reasonable. The author also mentioned that they would want the same for their own kids. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong here. They were following up on the customer's request for more info and gave accurate details about the game's content. The mother made the choice not to buy it after being informed. The co-worker's reaction might be about not wanting to interfere, but the author was just doing their job. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
