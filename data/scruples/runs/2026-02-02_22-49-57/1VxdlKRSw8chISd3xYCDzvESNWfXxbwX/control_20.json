I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the employee at Target explained the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old son, leading her to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just providing necessary information.\n\nFirst, consider the store's policies. Employees are usually encouraged to inform customers about product content, especially for age-appropriate ratings. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences, so the employee was probably just following standard practice. The mother was seeking information, and the employee provided it. That seems responsible.\n\nSecond, the age of the child is a key factor. GTA V's content, including violence, swearing, and sexual themes, is definitely not suitable for a 9-year-old. The employee's actions align with protecting a young child from inappropriate content. The mother made the final decision based on that info, which is a good outcome.\n\nNow, the co-worker's reaction. The employee isn't in the wrong for standing by their decision to provide honest information. The coworkers' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the employee was wrong. The employee's reasoning is based on wanting to be informed if they were in the parent's position, which is a valid perspective. \n\nNo laws or policies were broken here. The employee acted within their role to help the customer make an informed choice. The mother appreciated the information, so the action was helpful. The co-worker's criticism is misplaced because the employee was doing their job responsibly. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
