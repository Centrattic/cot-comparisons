I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target in electronics, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother asked for information, and the author detailed the graphic content of GTA V, leading her to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author's reasoning is that they were providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which typically means it's not suitable for under 17. The mother was purchasing for a 9-year-old, so there's an age mismatch. The author's role in a retail setting is to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate ratings. By explaining the graphic scenes, they're acting within their responsibility to provide accurate information. The co-worker's complaint seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly underestimating the importance of such content warnings for a young child. The author's intent was to help the parent make a responsible choice, not to be malicious. The key point is whether the author overstepped by giving detailed info when the parent asked. Since the parent asked for more details, the author's response was appropriate. There's no indication they forced the decision; the mother made the choice based on the information. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
