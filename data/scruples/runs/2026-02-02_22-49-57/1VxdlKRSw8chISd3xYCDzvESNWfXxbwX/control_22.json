I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works at Target and was helping a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which has an M (Mature) rating. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, and convinced her not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, but the author thinks he's in the right because he's informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V's content is like. It's known for violence, strong language, sexual content, and other mature themes. The age rating is 17+, so a 9-year-old is way under that. The author's job is to help customers, and providing accurate information about product content is part of that. The mother might not know the details of the game beyond the title, so the author is filling in important info that could affect her decision.\n\nThe key points here are: the author gave factual information about the game's content, which led the mother to make an informed choice. The co-worker criticized him, but the author's intent was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The mother was concerned after being informed, so she chose a different game. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The author didn't force her to not buy it; he provided info. The mother had the final say. The author's action aligns with responsible consumer advocacy, especially regarding child safety. The co-worker's reaction seems to be about not wanting to interfere, but the author was actually helping the parent make a better decision. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author overstepped by being too detailed. But given the age of the child, the content's maturity, and the author's role in informing, it's reasonable. The mother asked for more info when she said \"if it was okay,\" indicating she wanted to know. The author's response was appropriate in the context of parental guidance.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted responsibly by providing necessary information to help a parent make a decision in their child's best interest.\n"
