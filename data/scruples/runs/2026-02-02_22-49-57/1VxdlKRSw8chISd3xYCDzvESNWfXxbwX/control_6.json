I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content in GTA V to a mother, leading her not to buy it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The author works in electronics at Target. A customer wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided against buying it. The co-worker was upset, saying it was a \"dick move,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the action taken. The author's intention was to inform the mother about the content to help her make an informed decision. The mother was seeking advice since she wasn't familiar with the game. The author provided factual information about the game's content, which is protected under freedom of speech. The mother used that information to decide not to buy it, which is her right as a parent. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force the mother not to buy the game; they provided information. The author's actions align with helping a customer make an informed choice, especially regarding a child's purchase. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too graphic in the description. But the author's reasoning is valid\u2014parents should know about content that might be inappropriate for their children. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing the customer's choice over the parent's informed decision. \n\nIn terms of company policy, the author might need to check if there are guidelines about discussing game content. But generally, employees are expected to inform customers about product details. The author's approach was professional and helpful, leading to a positive outcome where the parent made a choice based on accurate information.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because their actions were in the interest of informing the customer, which is a legitimate and responsible action.\n"
