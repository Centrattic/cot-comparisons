I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The employee explained the M rating, including graphic scenes like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The coworker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions. The employee's reasoning is that they would want similar information if buying a game for their own kids.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9 years old), the content of the game (M-rated with violent and mature themes), and the employee's role in providing information. Legally, there's no law preventing the sale of M-rated games to minors, but stores can choose to enforce ratings. Ethically, the employee is acting in what they believe is the best interest of the child, ensuring the mother is informed. \n\nHowever, the mother was already aware of the M rating and asked for more info, so the employee's detailed explanation might have gone beyond just the rating. The question is whether the employee overstepped by actively discouraging the purchase. But since the employee's job is to help the customer make an informed decision, providing detailed content warnings is part of their role. The mother then made the choice based on that info. The coworker's complaint is about not letting the child play, but the employee's intention was to inform, not to make a judgment. \n\nSo, the employee isn't in the wrong because they were helping the customer make an informed choice, which aligns with responsible selling practices. The answer should be B.\n"
