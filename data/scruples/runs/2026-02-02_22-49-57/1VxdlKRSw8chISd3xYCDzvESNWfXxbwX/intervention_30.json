I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by informing a mother about the mature content in GTA V, leading her not to buy it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works in a store where they sell video games. Their co-worker was helping a customer (a mother) buy a game for her son. The mother's son is 9, and GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother decided not to buy it, and the co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the child.\n\nNow, the key points here are the responsibility of the store employee to inform customers about the content of products, especially when there's an age rating involved. The author is acting in a role where they are supposed to provide accurate information to help customers make informed decisions. By giving detailed warnings about the M-rated content, the author is fulfilling their duty to the customer, not to the co-worker or the child.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to stem from a desire to let the kid get the game, but that's a different perspective. The author's intention was to help the mother make a responsible choice. Since the mother is the one making the purchase, the author's job is to assist her, not the child. There's no law against informing customers about product content, and in many places, businesses are required to inform parents about age-appropriate content.\n\nAdditionally, the author is following their own ethical stance, which is that if they were a parent, they'd want to know the details. That's a reasonable position. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily mean the author is wrong; people have different opinions on such matters. But from an ethical standpoint, the author is helping prevent a purchase that might be inappropriate for the child's age.\n\nI don't see any malicious intent here. The author is not forcing the mother to make a decision but providing her with the necessary information. The mother then decides not to buy it. The co-worker's complaint seems to be about interfering with the child's wishes, but the employee's role is to support the customer's decision-making process, not to facilitate a purchase that might be against the parent's best judgment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They are doing their job by providing accurate information about the product's content, which is in line with the store's responsibility to customers and in the best interest of the child.\n"
