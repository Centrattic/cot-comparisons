I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not selling a game to a child. The situation is that the author, working at a store, informed a mother about the mature content in GTA V and convinced her not to buy it for her 9-year-old son. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and making a scene.\n\nFirst, the author's role as a salesperson includes providing accurate information about products. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The mother asked for more details, and the author provided the necessary info about the content. The mother then decided against the purchase. The author's action seems to align with the responsibility of a salesperson to inform customers about product content, especially when it's a matter of appropriateness for a child.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism is about the author overstepping, but the key point is that the mother was given the information she needed to make an informed decision. The author didn't force the sale or act out of malice; they were being responsible. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and employees are often trained to discuss content ratings. The author's own reasoning about wanting the same information if they were a parent makes sense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting in the best interest of informing the customer, not imposing personal views. The answer should be B.\n"
