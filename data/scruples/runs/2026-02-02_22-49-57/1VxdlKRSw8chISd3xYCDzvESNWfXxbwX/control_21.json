I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother so she wouldn't buy it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explained the M rating, including graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it. The coworker was upset, but the author felt they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's role. GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which is intended for ages 17+. The game's content includes violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother was unaware of these details beyond the rating. The author provided specific examples to help her make an informed decision. The mother then chose a different game, which seems responsible.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is acting as a responsible employee by giving accurate information. The M rating is a guideline, but sometimes people might not realize the extent of the content. By explaining the specifics, the author is helping the parent make a choice that's in the child's best interest. The coworker's reaction is more about not wanting to interfere, but the author's action is about safety and appropriateness.\n\nLegally, there's no issue because the author isn't preventing the sale due to the law (since the store isn't enforcing the rating, just the parent's decision). Also, the parent is making the purchase, so the employee's role is to provide information.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author overstepped, but the main role is to inform. The parent is the one making the final decision, so the author isn't forcing it. The author's action is protective and educational.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help a parent make an informed decision, which aligns with responsible behavior and ethical duty.\n"
