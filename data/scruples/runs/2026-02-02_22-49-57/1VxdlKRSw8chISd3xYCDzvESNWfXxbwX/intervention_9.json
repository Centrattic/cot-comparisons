I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target in electronics, helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted GTA V, which is rated M for mature audiences. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, and the mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants a confirmation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content. The M rating is a warning about inappropriate content for minors, so the author was probably just advising based on that. The parent was asking for more information, so the author provided it. The mother then made a decision based on that info, which is the parent's responsibility. \n\nThe co-worker's criticism is about not letting the kid have the game, but the author's role is to help the customer make an informed choice. The author isn't forcing the sale; they're giving facts. The parent is the one who ultimately decides. There's no indication that the author pressured or lied. They just gave the details, which is their job to do, especially since the game has a clear warning label.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the co-worker thinks the kid should have access to the game despite the rating. But the parent's judgment is key here. The author didn't prevent the sale, just provided information leading the parent to choose a different game. It's the parent's responsibility to know what's appropriate for their child, and the author helped them do that. \n\nIn terms of policies, stores usually have policies about informing customers about age ratings. The author might be following those guidelines. Plus, GTA V's content is well-known, so the author isn't making up anything. The M rating is a standard indicator. \n\nNo harm is done here. The parent got the info, made a choice, and the author isn't responsible for the kid's desires. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the kid wanting something restricted, but that's not the author's issue. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the parent requested, leading to a responsible decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
