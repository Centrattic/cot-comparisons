I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The employee's coworker was upset about it, calling it \"videogame cockblocking.\" The employee's reasoning is that they wanted to inform the mother about the content to help her make a decision, similar to how they would want for their own kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The employee is trying to protect a child from inappropriate content by informing the parent. GTA V is rated M, which is for mature audiences, so there's an expectation that parents should know about the content. The employee provided accurate information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker is upset because they think the employee is overstepping. The employee's approach was direct, mentioning graphic scenes, but was it wrong? The key here is whether the employee had the right to influence the purchase like that. In a retail setting, employees are often encouraged to provide accurate information about products, including content ratings. However, going beyond the standard rating and giving a detailed, potentially graphic description might be seen as personal judgment.\n\nBut the mother asked for more information, so the employee was responding to her request. The employee's intention was to help the mother make an informed decision. The mother then chose not to buy the game after being informed. The employee isn't forcing the decision; they're providing facts. \n\nIn terms of company policy, it's possible that employees are allowed to discuss content ratings, but there might be guidelines about not adding personal opinions. If the employee stayed within the bounds of factual information, then it's probably okay. However, if the employee went beyond that into personal judgment, maybe not. But the description here is that the employee gave examples of content, which is part of the M rating. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems more about the employee making a personal choice to influence the sale. But the employee's action was in the interest of protecting a child's exposure to inappropriate content. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the employee's actions were well-intentioned and within their role of providing necessary information. The mother was informed and made her own decision. The coworker's criticism seems misplaced. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
