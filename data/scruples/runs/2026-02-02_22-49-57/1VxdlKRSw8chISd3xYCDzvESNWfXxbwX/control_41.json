I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which is rated M for Mature. The author explained the content, like the graphic scenes, torture, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother then decided not to buy it and picked a different game. The co-worker wasn't happy and called it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and there was some mixed reaction in the break room. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of a retail employee in this context. The author's job is to help customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. The mother asked for more information, so the author gave a detailed explanation of the content. The parent made the decision based on that info. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the game has an M rating, which is the ESRB rating in the US. However, there's no law that prevents someone under 18 from purchasing an M-rated game, though stores have policies against selling them to minors, but here the parent was buying for her son. The author's role isn't to second-guess the customer's decision, but to provide the information they need. The mother was the one making the choice, and the author just informed her of the content.\n\nEthically, the author is acting in what they believe is the child's best interest. They wanted the parent to be fully informed so she could make a decision. The parent didn't take the advice as pressure but as information, and she chose to act on it. The co-worker's complaint is about the author influencing the purchase, but the author was fulfilling their duty to inform.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too graphic in the details. Maybe they went beyond just stating the rating and gave explicit content descriptions that the parent didn't ask for. But since the parent asked for more information, the author provided it. If the parent was seeking a responsible game for her child, the detailed info would be necessary.\n\nIn some states, there are laws about selling certain content to minors, but since the parent was purchasing for her child, the store employee isn't legally obligated to prevent the sale if the parent is buying it. However, the employee's role is to inform, not to make the decision for the customer. So, the author wasn't wrong in providing the necessary information. The parent's decision was her own, and the author helped her make an informed choice.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They did their job by providing full disclosure about the game's content, allowing the parent to make an informed decision. The co-worker's criticism is about personal opinion, but the author acted ethically and responsibly.\n"
