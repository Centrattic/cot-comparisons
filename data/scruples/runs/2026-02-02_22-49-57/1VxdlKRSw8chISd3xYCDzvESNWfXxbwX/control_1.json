I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for detailing graphic content in GTA V to a mother to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was working at Target, helping a customer who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The game has an M rating (for Mature), which is typically for ages 17+. The author explained the content, including graphic elements, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the action, calling it \"cockblocking.\"\n\nThe author's argument is that they were providing necessary information to help the mother make an informed decision. The question is whether that action makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nLegally and ethically, retailers are supposed to provide information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The M rating exists to inform parents about the suitable age range. By explaining the content, the author was acting in line with their responsibility to inform the customer accurately. The mother then used that information to decide against purchasing for her young child, which is a responsible choice.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author went beyond the M rating and gave explicit details that the mother might not have needed. But GTA V is known for its mature content, and the ESRB rating already includes descriptors for violence, language, etc. The author's intention was to prevent a 9-year-old from accessing content unsuitable for his age, which aligns with child protection standards.\n\nThe co-worker's frustration might stem from a belief that the author overstepped, but the author's action was in the best interest of the child and the customer's informed choice. There's no indication the author forced the decision, just provided facts. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
