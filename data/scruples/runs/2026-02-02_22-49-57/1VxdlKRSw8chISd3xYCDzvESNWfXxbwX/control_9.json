I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who detailed the graphic scenes in GTA V to the mother is in the wrong. The situation is that the mother wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author, but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is 17+. Retailers are supposed to follow these ratings, so refusing a sale might not be necessary, but informing the customer is part of the job. The author was doing their job by explaining the content. However, the mother was the one making the decision, and the author's role is to inform her accurately.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is that the author was \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The author believes that providing full details helps the parent make an informed choice. It's a common debate about the responsibility of employees to go beyond just stating the rating and explaining the content in detail.\n\nIn many places, stores have policies about not selling M-rated games to minors, but the mother wasn't a minor. The author's action could be seen as overstepping if they didn't just stick to the rating explanation. However, the parent is the one deciding, and giving more info is part of customer service. The key is whether the author crossed the line into giving unsolicited advice or if it's part of their duty to inform.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want the same if they were buying for their kids. That's a valid perspective. The ESRB rating is a guideline, but explaining the content helps the parent understand why it's rated that way. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision. The co-worker's reaction might be more about the method rather than the intent. Therefore, answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
