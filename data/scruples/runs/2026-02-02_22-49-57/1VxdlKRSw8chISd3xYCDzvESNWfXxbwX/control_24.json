I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer came in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explained the game's M rating and detailed some of the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother decided not to buy it. Then, the co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" and there was mixed response among coworkers.\n\nThe author is unsure if they were the asshole. They justify their actions by saying they wanted to inform the mother about the content so she could make an informed decision, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying a game for their kids.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The mother didn't know much about the game and asked for more info. The author provided that info, which led to the mother making a different choice. The co-worker's reaction seems more about not wanting to restrict a child's game choice, but the author believes in parental guidance and informed decisions.\n\nLegally, stores can't prevent customers from buying age-rated products unless there are specific laws. However, the employee isn't obligated to sell the product if they believe it's inappropriate. Ethically, the author is acting in good faith to prevent a child from accessing content that's rated for mature audiences. The key point is whether the author overstepped by providing detailed info that led the mother to change her decision. But since the mother asked for more information and the author provided it honestly, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother made the choice based on the information given. The co-worker's criticism might stem from a different view on parental control versus child's choice, but the author's action was within their right to inform.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They provided necessary information for an informed decision, which is a responsible action.\n"
