I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they work at Target in electronics and helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old. The mother wanted GTA V, which is rated M for mature audiences. The author explained the game's graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized them as \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. GTA V is an M-rated game, which typically isn't recommended for those under 17. The mother didn't know the content details, so the author informed her. The author's intention was to help her make an informed decision, which seems responsible. However, the co-worker and others in the break room had mixed reactions, some thinking the author was overstepping.\n\nLegally, the author isn't violating any laws by providing accurate information about the game's content. Ethically, it's about responsibility. Parents are supposed to make informed choices about what their children consume. The author is acting as a responsible employee by advising them on the game's content. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, maybe valuing the customer's choice over the child's well-being. \n\nBut wait, is there a point where an employee should not give such advice? Retail employees are supposed to provide accurate information about products. Since the author was explaining the ESRB rating and the content, it's within their role. The mother was the one making the decision, and she chose not to buy the game after being informed. So the author isn't forcing her, just giving information. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have just mentioned the M rating and left it at that. But the mother asked for more details, so she was seeking the information. The author's detailed explanation was in response to her request. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were in a similar situation. That's a valid point. It's about transparency and helping parents make decisions they're comfortable with. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help a parent make an informed choice, which is their responsibility as an employee. The co-worker's reaction is more about differing opinions on the appropriateness of the game for children, not the author's actions being at fault.\n"
