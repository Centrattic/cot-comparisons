I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset about this, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and there was mixed reaction among other coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The employee's main argument is that they provided the mother with detailed information about the game's content so she could make an informed decision. This aligns with the idea of being responsible and helping a customer make a choice that's in their child's best interest. On the other hand, the co-worker might see it as overstepping, especially if the mother was already aware of the M rating and the employee went beyond that to give explicit details about the content. \n\nI should think about the role of an employee in such a scenario. The employee's job is to assist customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. However, there's a line between giving necessary information and overstepping by adding personal opinions or graphic details that might influence the customer's decision. The key here is whether the employee acted within their professional boundaries. \n\nAlso, the mother asked for more information after being informed about the M rating. The employee explained the content, which could be seen as responsible, especially since the child is quite young. GTA V is rated for older audiences due to its mature themes. The mother's decision to not buy the game after being informed suggests that the information was helpful. \n\nAnother angle is the co-worker's perspective. They might feel that the employee shouldn't have intervened so directly, possibly infringing on the customer's choice. But the employee's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which could be a valid concern. \n\nLegal aspects might not be the main issue here, but ethically, the employee was trying to prevent a purchase they deemed unsuitable for a child. However, it's possible that the employee could have provided the information in a more neutral, factual manner without being overly graphic, which might have been just as effective without causing offense. \n\nIn summary, the employee's actions seem to be in the best interest of the child and the customer, but there's a potential overstep in providing detailed, graphic descriptions. The key is whether the employee was within their role to provide that information. Since the customer asked for more details, the employee's response might be justified. However, if the co-worker felt it was unnecessary, there's room for debate. The answer might depend on cultural or company policies as well. But generally, informing a customer about content to help them make an informed decision isn't wrong. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
