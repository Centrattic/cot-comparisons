I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. They explained the game's mature content, which led the mom to choose a different game. Their coworker felt they were \"cockblocking\" the kid, but others had mixed reactions.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author is a Target employee who provided honest information about the game's content. The mother was concerned after learning about the graphic scenes, swearing, and online aspects. The author's motivation seems to be protecting the child, especially since the mother was underinformed. \n\nIn many places, there are laws requiring retailers to inform customers about age ratings, like the ESRB in the US. By explaining the M rating and its implications, the author is probably just doing their job. Also, the mother didn't force the sale and actually decided against it, so there's no harm done. The coworker's reaction might be more about thinking the kid should get the game regardless, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing the child's well-being. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent here. The author is acting in good faith, providing necessary information so the parent can make an informed decision. Parents are expected to know their kids' maturity levels, but if the parent isn't aware, it's reasonable for the employee to step in. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
