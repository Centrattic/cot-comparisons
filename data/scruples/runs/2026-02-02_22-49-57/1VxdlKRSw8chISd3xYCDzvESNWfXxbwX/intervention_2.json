I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target, a co-worker was helping a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The mother asked for more info about GTA V's content. The author detailed the graphic scenes, which made the mother decide not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"cockblocking,\" but the author felt they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for mature audiences. The author explained the content, which is part of their job. The mother was concerned after being informed. The author's intention was to help the parent make an informed decision, which aligns with responsible customer service. The co-worker's frustration seems to come from thinking the author overstepped, but the author was just providing necessary information. \n\nThe key points here are the responsibility of the employee to inform customers about product content, especially when it's age-inappropriate. The author didn't force the mother not to buy it; they simply gave her the facts. The M rating is there for a reason, so the author's actions supported the rating system. It's reasonable to assume that a parent would want to know about violent or explicit content before buying for a young child. \n\nI don't see how the author is in the wrong here. They were doing their job to provide accurate information, which the mother appreciated. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about disagreeing with the decision, not the act of informing. The author's reasoning\u2014that they'd want the same for their own kids\u2014makes sense. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
