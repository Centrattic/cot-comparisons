I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for detailing the graphic content of GTA V to a mother considering buying it for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer, a mother, wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author, knowing the game's M rating and its content, explained the graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided against it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were providing necessary information to help a parent make an informed decision. They compare it to wanting the same info if they were the parent. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the employee's role in giving advice.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle: GTA V is rated M for Mature audiences, which is 17+. The game's content includes violence, sexual content, and strong language. A 9-year-old is way below that age. The author is pointing out the game's content to align with the rating. The mother wasn't aware of the specifics, so the employee provided details. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, as an employee, part of their job is to inform customers about products. However, there might be a line when it comes to giving unsolicited detailed information beyond what's on the packaging. But in this case, the mother asked for more info after the M rating. The author gave more specifics, which led to her making a different choice. The author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the game's content is rated appropriately, so the store isn't obligated to prevent the sale, but employees can give their opinions. Ethically, the author is acting in the best interest of the child, helping the parent make an informed decision. The co-worker's criticism is about interfering, but the parent's responsibility is to know what their child is exposed to. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're providing necessary information that the parent sought, helping them adhere to the game's rating. The answer should be B (No).\n"
