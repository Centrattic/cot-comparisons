I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. The author worked at Target, helped a customer who wanted to buy the game for her son, and explained the M rating and the specific content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online features. The mother decided not to buy it, but the co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking.\" The author is unsure if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The mother was seeking more information because she wanted to make an informed decision about what her child plays. The author provided that information, which is part of their job as a salesperson. The M rating is there for a reason, indicating content not suitable for minors. By informing the mother, the author was helping her make a responsible choice. \n\nThen, the co-worker's reaction. The co-worker's concern might stem from thinking the author was overstepping, but the author's intention was to protect a child from inappropriate content. The mother's decision to buy a different game shows that the information was useful. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same for their own kids if they had any. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't breaking any rules by providing accurate information about the product. The mother was the one making the purchase, so the author had a duty to inform her about the game's content. The co-worker's criticism doesn't seem valid here because the author was doing their job correctly. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the author shouldn't have been so detailed, but the content is part of the game's rating. The mother asked for more info, so the author was fulfilling that request. Also, the author didn't force her not to buy it; they just provided the facts, which she used to make her own decision. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong. They were helping the customer make a responsible decision based on accurate information. The co-worker's reaction is more of a personal opinion, but the author's action was justified.\n"
