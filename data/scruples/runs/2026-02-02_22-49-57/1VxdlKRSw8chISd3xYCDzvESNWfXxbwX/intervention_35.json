I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author working at Target and convincing a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) for her 9-year-old son. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's role in advising the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the game's rating. GTAV is an M-rated game, which stands for \"Mature\" and is intended for ages 17+. The rating includes warnings for violence, strong language, and sexual content. The mother was buying the game for her 9-year-old, which is way below the recommended age. The author explained the game's content in detail, leading the mother to choose a different game.\n\nThe author's co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to provide information to help the mother make an informed decision. The author's perspective is that they were acting in the child's best interest, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying a game for their own child. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: Was the author overstepping their role? Did they have a responsibility to inform the customer about the game's content? As an employee, part of their role in electronics, especially when assisting with purchases, might involve providing accurate information about the product. The mother asked for more information after being told the game is M-rated, so the author's response was in line with the customer's request. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have just provided the rating and left the decision to the parent. But given that the parent asked for more details, the author's thorough explanation was appropriate. The parent ultimately made the choice not to buy the game after being informed. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction and the mixed responses from others don't necessarily indicate that the author was wrong; different people have different views on such matters. The author's action was about transparency and ensuring the parent is aware of the content, which aligns with ethical considerations of protecting minors from unsuitable content. \n\nIn conclusion, the author was acting in a responsible manner by providing necessary information, and the parent made an informed decision. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
