I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask a Manager post is in the wrong for not selling GTA V to a 9-year-old. The situation involves the employee explaining the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the role of the employee. Their job is to assist customers and provide information. The parent asked for more details, so the employee gave them the facts about the game's content. The mother decided against it after being informed. \n\nNow, is there a policy against discussing game content? The employee didn't prevent the sale but provided information. The mother was the one who made the decision based on that info. The co-worker's reaction is about being \"cockblocked,\" but the employee acted in what they believe is the right way, protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n\nAlso, the ESRB rating is M for Mature, which is meant for ages 17+. The employee is respecting that rating by informing the parent. There's no legal obligation to stop the sale, but ethically, it's about protecting minors. The employee's action aligns with ethical responsibility rather than personal gain.\n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about interfering, but the employee's intent was to inform, not to block. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily mean the employee was wrong. The key point is whether the employee crossed a line by not allowing the sale. Since they didn't force the mother not to buy it, just informed her, it's more about providing transparency.\n\nTherefore, the employee isn't in the wrong because they acted in good faith to inform a parent about content that could be inappropriate for a young child. The mother was empowered to make an informed decision, which is the employee's duty.\n"
