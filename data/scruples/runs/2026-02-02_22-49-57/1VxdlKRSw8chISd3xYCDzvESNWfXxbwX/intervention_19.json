I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, working at Target in electronics, convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main argument is that they were providing necessary information about the game's content to help the mother make an informed decision. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is appropriate for ages 17+. The mother didn't know much about the game, so the author explained the explicit content. The mother then chose a different game. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was protective, aiming to prevent the child from being exposed to inappropriate content. They might be seen as doing the right thing by upholding their responsibility as an employee to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to children. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and the author is reinforcing those guidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and a \"dick move.\" The question is whether the author overstepped. However, if the mother asked for more information and the author provided accurate details, then it's within their job to do so. The mother made the decision not to buy the game after being informed, which suggests the author acted appropriately.\n\nThe key points are: the mother requested more info, the author gave it, and she made a choice based on that. The author isn't forcing the sale; they're informing. The co-worker's reaction is more about disapproval of the outcome rather than the method. Since the author isn't the parent and can't make the decision, their role is to provide facts. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they're doing their job to inform the customer about the product's content, especially regarding minors. The mother had the final say, and the author's actions led to a responsible decision. The co-worker's disapproval doesn't make the author wrong, as the situation is about protecting a child's exposure to inappropriate material.\n"
