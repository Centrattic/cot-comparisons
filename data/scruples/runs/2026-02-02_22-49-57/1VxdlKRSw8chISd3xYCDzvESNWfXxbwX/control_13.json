I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old, explaining the graphic content. The co-worker got upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The employee was doing their job, which involves providing information about products. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, so the employee was explaining the content to help the customer make an informed decision. The mother was concerned after the explanation and chose a different game. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the employee interfering with a sale, but the employee's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content.\n\nLegally and ethically, retailers are supposed to provide accurate information about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The ESRB ratings are in place for a reason, and employees should inform customers about the content. The employee isn't forcing the mother not to buy the game; they're giving her the facts so she can decide. The mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed. So the employee isn't in the wrong here. They\u2019re acting responsibly by providing necessary information. The co-worker's complaint is more about losing a sale, which isn't a valid ethical concern compared to protecting a child from inappropriate content. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
