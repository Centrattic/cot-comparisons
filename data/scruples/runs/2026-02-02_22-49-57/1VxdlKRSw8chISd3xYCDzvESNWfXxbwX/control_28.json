I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old due to its mature content. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the sale.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which is rated M (for Mature). The mother was concerned after hearing about the graphic scenes, sexual themes, and swearing, so she decided against the purchase. The author's intention was to inform the mother so she could make an educated decision about her son's game. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped or acted inappropriately. Legally, in the US, stores aren't required to prevent sales of M-rated games to minors, but employees can choose to enforce their own policy. Ethically, the employee might be seen as protecting a child from inappropriate content, which is a common concern among parents and educators. The mother was grateful for the information, so the action had a positive outcome. However, the co-worker's reaction suggests that some might view the employee as interfering with the sale or being judgmental. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on wanting to be informed if they were in the mother's position. That's a standard ethical stance\u2014acting in others' best interests as you'd want for yourself. The key here is that the author didn't force the decision; they provided information, and the mother made the choice. There's no indication of harassment or bad faith. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they exercised their discretion to inform a customer, which is within their role as a responsible employee. The answer should be B.\n"
