I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a Target employee, the author, convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, thinking it was \"cockblocking,\" while the author believes they were just doing the right thing by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The employee's job is to help customers, right? So providing accurate information about a product's content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content, is part of their responsibility. GTA V has an M rating, which stands for Mature, so the employee correctly mentioned the rating. But the mother asked for more details, and the employee explained the graphic elements like torture scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. That seems reasonable because the mother was making a decision for her child, and she needed to know all the details to make an informed choice.\n\nNow, the co-worker's reaction is another angle. They felt the author was being a \"dick\" and \"cockblocking.\" But is that a valid perspective? The co-worker might be thinking that the employee overstepped by discouraging the sale, but the employee's role is to provide information, not to make the purchase decision. The mother decided not to buy it after being informed, which is exactly why the employee shared the details. The co-worker's complaint might stem from a misunderstanding of the employee's duty to inform rather than to promote the sale.\n\nLegally, stores often have guidelines about not pressuring customers, but here the employee was giving accurate information. The mother was free to choose another game after being informed. There's no indication the employee forced her to do anything; they merely presented the facts.\n\nThe author's reasoning is sound. They believe that if they were in a similar situation, they would want the same transparency. That's a common-sense approach. Parents have a right to know what content their children are exposed to, especially when the game is rated for older audiences. The key here is that the employee didn't prevent the sale but provided the necessary info for the parent to decide. The mother made the decision not to buy, so the employee's role was fulfilled.\n\nAnother point is the age of the child. A 9-year-old is much younger than the 16-18 age range the author mentions. The game's content is inappropriate for such a young child. By highlighting the graphic elements, the employee is actually protecting the child from potentially harmful content. The employee isn't in the wrong for advocating for the child's well-being, even if it means the store loses a sale.\n\nHowever, there might be a thin line where the employee could be seen as overstepping if they didn't provide balanced information or if they were biased. But in this case, the employee was honest about the game's content as per its rating and the actual content, which is appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted correctly by informing the mother of the game's content, allowing her to make an informed decision. The employee's actions were in the best interest of the child, and there's no wrong in that. The co-worker's reaction seems to misunderstand the employee's duty to provide accurate information rather than to push a sale.\n"
