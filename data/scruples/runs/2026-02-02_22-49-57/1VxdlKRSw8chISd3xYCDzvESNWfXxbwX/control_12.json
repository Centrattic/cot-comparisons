I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author worked at Target and a customer wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author detailed the game's graphic content, leading the mother to change her purchase. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author believes they were just doing their job by informing the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of an employee in a retail setting. The author was in the electronics department, so part of their job is to assist customers with purchases. When a customer asks about a product, especially one as content-heavy as a video game with an M rating, the employee should provide accurate information. The author did explain the M rating and the specific content, which is appropriate. The mother was informed and made a decision based on that, which seems like a good outcome.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. The key here is whether the author went beyond just providing factual information. The author didn't prevent the sale; they offered information. The mother chose not to buy the game after being informed. The co-worker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" implying the author didn't let the child get the game. But the author's role is to inform, not to make the decision. It's the parent's responsibility to decide what's appropriate for their child. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is sound. They compared it to wanting to know the content if they were buying a game for their own kids. That's a common-sense approach. Retail employees often advise customers on product content, especially for age-appropriate items. The author didn't force the mother to change her mind; they just provided the necessary details. \n\nThe mixed reactions from coworkers suggest that some might have a different view, but the main point is about the author's actions. Since the author was informing the parent, who is the one making the purchase, it's not the author's place to make that decision. The author did their job by giving the mother all the relevant information so she could make an informed choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
