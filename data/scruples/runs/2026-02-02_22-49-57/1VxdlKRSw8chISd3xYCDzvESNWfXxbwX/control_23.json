I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not selling GTA V to a 9-year-old. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author is a Target employee in electronics. A mother wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The game has an M rating (for mature audiences). The author explained the content\u2014torture scenes, sexual themes, strong language, and online components. The mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, but the author felt they were just doing their job by informing the parent.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The employee's role is to help customers make informed decisions. The mother asked for more info, so providing accurate details about the game's content seems responsible. The game is rated M for a reason, which is meant to warn about inappropriate content for minors. The author isn't forcing the sale; they're giving a factual warning. The mother then made her own choice based on that info. The co-worker's reaction is about the author \"cockblocking,\" but the author is prioritizing the child's well-being. The author's reasoning is that they would want similar info if they were a parent, so they acted in good faith. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against not selling a game if you don't want to. The employee isn't violating any company policy; if anything, they're following it by providing accurate info. The mother didn't feel pressured; she chose to buy a different game. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
