I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and the author is unsure if they were an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The main points are the age of the child, the M-rated game, and the employee's actions. GTA V is indeed rated M for mature audiences, which typically means it's not suitable for under 17. The employee explained the content, which led the mother to decide against buying it. \n\nOn one hand, the employee is following the rating system's intent by informing the parent about the content, which is their responsibility in a retail role. They're helping the parent make an informed decision, which seems like a good thing. The mother was appreciative of the information, so she made a choice based on that. The co-worker's reaction is a bit concerning, but the employee's intent was to protect a child from inappropriate content.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the employee overstepped by being too graphic. However, the mother asked for more information, so providing details about the content isn't inherently wrong. The key here is that the parent is the one making the decision after being informed. The employee didn't force them; they just gave the facts. \n\nAlso, the M rating is a guideline meant to protect minors, so the employee's actions align with the purpose of the rating system. Retailers are supposed to inform customers about content to help them decide. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced because the employee was doing their job correctly.\n\nI don't see any malicious intent here. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information for their own kids. That's a valid perspective. The mother was the one who changed her mind, so the employee isn't the one making the decision but providing necessary info.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
