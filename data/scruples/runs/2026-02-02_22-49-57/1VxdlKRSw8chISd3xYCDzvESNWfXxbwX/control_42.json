I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit-style question is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature by the ESRB, which typically means it's not suitable for under 17. The author explained the game's content in detail, including graphic scenes, and the mother decided against buying it. The coworker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the context. The author's goal was to inform the mother about the game's content, which aligns with providing necessary information for a parent to make an informed decision. The mother was asking for more information, and the author gave it honestly. The age of the child is a significant factor here. 9 years old is well below the recommended age for an M-rated game, so the author's concern is valid from a parental guidance perspective.\n\nThe coworker's criticism seems to stem from a different viewpoint, possibly valuing the child's autonomy or not seeing the content as problematic. However, the author isn't a parent here; they're a salesperson whose role is to provide accurate information. The author isn't forcing the mother to not buy the game but is offering facts so she can decide. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to prevent someone from purchasing something they're legally allowed to buy, but in this case, the author is acting in what they believe is the child's best interest. The mother made an informed choice based on the information given. There's no indication the author lied or exaggerated the content. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, allowing the parent to make an informed decision. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the author's actions are justified in wanting to protect a child from age-inappropriate content.\n"
