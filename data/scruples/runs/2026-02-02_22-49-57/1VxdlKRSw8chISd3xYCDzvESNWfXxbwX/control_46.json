I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset, but the mother decided against buying it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The employee provided information about the game's M rating, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The co-worker called it \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it with others. The author feels they were just doing what they'd want for their own kids.\n\nNow, I should think about the ethical implications. The employee's role is to help customers make informed decisions. Parents have a right to know about the content of games they're buying for their children. The game has an M rating, which is intended for mature audiences. By explaining the content, the employee was acting in the child's best interest. However, some might argue that the employee overstepped by not just stating the rating but giving detailed descriptions of graphic scenes. But the mother asked for more information, so the employee was just fulfilling her request. The employee's actions prevented the purchase of an age-inappropriate game, which is responsible. The co-worker's reaction is about personal opinion, but the employee isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the child's well-being. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
