I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mother avoid buying GTA V for her 9-year-old by explaining the mature content. The coworker was upset about it, and the author is now questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means it's for 17+. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, so the author was probably just informing the mother about the content as per the rating. The mother asked for more details, so the author provided them, which led the mother to make a different choice. \n\nThe author's argument is that they were being honest and doing what they would want for their own kids. It's a protective stance, ensuring that the mother is fully informed. The coworker's reaction seems to stem from a different perspective, maybe thinking the author overstepped, but the mother was the one who made the final decision. \n\nIs there a line crossed here? The author didn't force the mother to do anything. They just provided accurate information about the game's content. The mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed. The author's role in the scenario is to be a helpful customer service rep, giving necessary information. There's no indication of any false claims or misleading the mother. \n\nLegally, the author isn't liable because they're just conveying the game's content as per the ESRB rating. Ethically, it makes sense to be truthful about content when a parent is making a purchase for a child. The coworker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" but the author's actions were in the interest of responsible purchasing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the mother wanted, leading her to make an informed decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
