I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, and the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was buying the game for her young child, and the employee provided information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The employee's main argument is that they were just informing the parent so she could make an educated decision, similar to how they would want information if they were buying a game for their own kids.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the employee's actions seem to be in the interest of protecting a child from inappropriate content. The game has an M rating, which is for mature audiences, and the employee went a step further to explain the specific content. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase, so the outcome was positive in terms of the child not getting an age-inappropriate game.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction is also a point to consider. The employee might have been overstepping if they didn't have a professional reason to do so. But in retail, especially when dealing with products that have age ratings, employees are often encouraged to inform customers about appropriate age groups. The employee's intention was to help the customer make an informed choice, which is a valid role in customer service.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee shouldn't have intervened so directly, especially if the parent had the right to make that decision. However, given the significant content in GTA V that's unsuitable for a 9-year-old, the employee's concern is understandable. The key point is whether the employee provided factual information without overstepping. Since the mother was concerned and opted for a different game, the employee's actions led to a positive outcome without being coercive.\n\nIn conclusion, the employee acted in good faith to inform the parent, which is a responsible action. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
