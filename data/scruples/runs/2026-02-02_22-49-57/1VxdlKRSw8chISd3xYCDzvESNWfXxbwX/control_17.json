I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V has a mature rating (M) due to its content, including violence, sexual themes, and strong language. The employee provided detailed information about the game's content when asked, which led the mother to decide against purchasing it.\n\nThe co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee's intention was to inform the mother so she could make an educated decision. The employee's reasoning is that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want that information too. \n\nLegally and ethically, the employee is within their rights to share the content details as part of their job. The parents have the responsibility to choose appropriate games, and the employee is helping them by providing accurate information. The co-worker's complaint is about preventing a sale, but the employee's primary duty is to assist the customer with informed choices, not to push a sale. \n\nThe key points are the employee's honesty, the relevance of the information provided, and the mother's subsequent decision. There's no indication the employee forced or pressured the mother; they simply informed her. Therefore, the employee isn't in the wrong.\n"
