My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that their parents gave them a male name (like John) after their grandfather, but the person is a girl and wants to change it to a nickname derived from their last name. The parents are upset because they think it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the right to change one's name. In most places, adults can legally change their names if they want, as it's a personal choice. The person is 21, so they're an adult, so they have the autonomy to make this decision. Their reasons include being teased and wanting to use a nickname they've used socially. That's a valid personal reason. The parents are upset, but that doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. They value their autonomy and their comfort in their own identity over their parents' disapproval.\n\nBut also, the parents' feelings matter. They named the person with the intention of honoring the grandfather, and the change might feel disrespectful. However, the person isn't rejecting the grandfather entirely\u2014maybe they're just finding a name that fits their identity better. The key here is balancing personal identity with family history. The person isn't in the wrong because they have the right to choose their name, especially if it's affecting their well-being. The parents' disapproval is unfortunate but doesn't negate the person's right to make this choice. So the answer is B.\n"
