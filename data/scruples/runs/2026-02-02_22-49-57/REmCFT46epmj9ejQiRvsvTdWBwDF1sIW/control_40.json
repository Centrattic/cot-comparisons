My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she was named after her grandfather, who had a male name, and now she wants to change her name to a female version of her nickname. Her parents aren't happy with this, especially her mom, who thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She's 21 and engaged, which means she's an adult and can make her own decisions. She's been using a nickname for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name. The problem is the original name is a male name, causing her to be teased. Changing her name could be about her comfort and identity. \n\nOn the other hand, her parents see it as a betrayal of her grandfather's memory. But she mentions the parents didn't use the female version of the name when naming her. Maybe they didn't consider that she might not identify with the male name. So she's trying to find a name that feels more like her.\n\nLegally, adults can change their names if they want. So from a rights perspective, she's allowed to do it. The question is more about whether she's morally in the wrong. The mother's disapproval is significant, but does that make the author wrong? She's prioritizing her own well-being and identity over her parents' wishes. \n\nI think the main factors here are her autonomy as an adult, her lifelong use of the nickname, and the impact of the name on her social experience. The parents' feelings are important, but if she's been using the nickname for so long and the real name has caused her issues, it's reasonable for her to want to change. Also, the grandfather's memory was honored by the original name, but she's creating a name that's a variation, not erasing him entirely. \n\nSo probably, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
