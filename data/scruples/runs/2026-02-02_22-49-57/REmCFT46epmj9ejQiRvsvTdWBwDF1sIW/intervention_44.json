My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author was given a male name after their grandfather, but it's not the female version. They've been teased for it in school, and now they want to change both their first and last name. The new name is a nickname that friends use, and the fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks the author is forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding despite the mom's disapproval.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's reasons for changing the name. They mention being teased, which is a valid emotional impact. Also, they've used the nickname socially for a long time, so it feels more like their identity now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which adds to the personal significance.\n\nThe mom's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the author is an adult now, 21 and engaged, so they have the right to make decisions about their own identity. The name change is a personal choice, especially when the original name causes distress. The grandfather's memory is important, but so is the individual's right to self-identify. \n\nThe parent's disapproval might come from a place of honoring family tradition, but the author's well-being and personal identity should take precedence. There's no indication that the author is disrespecting the grandfather; they acknowledge the gesture but feel the name doesn't fit. \n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name for personal reasons, especially when it affects self-esteem and social interactions, is seen as a valid choice. The mother's refusal to accept the new name could lead to a strained relationship, but the author is prioritizing their own happiness. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice that aligns with their identity and well-being, even if it means going against their parent's wishes. The answer should be B.\n"
