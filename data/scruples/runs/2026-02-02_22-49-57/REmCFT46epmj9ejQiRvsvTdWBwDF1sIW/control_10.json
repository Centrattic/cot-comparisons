My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name they were given by their parents, which is after their grandfather. The name is something like \"John,\" which isn't a typical girl's name and has led to teasing. They want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The person has been teased for their name, which can affect self-esteem. Choosing a name that feels more authentic to them, especially when their fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, seems like a personal choice. On the other hand, the parents had a reason for the name, honoring the grandfather, so the daughter changing it might feel like a rejection of that tradition.\n\nBut in many societies, changing one's name is a personal right. It's about self-identity and comfort. The fact that the nickname is already established and accepted by others supports the argument that the name change is natural. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's autonomy is important. Being in the wrong would imply that the daughter is disrespecting her family without justification. However, given the ongoing teasing and the name not fitting her identity, the justification seems valid. So the answer is likely B.\n"
