My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to change her name.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which is her grandfather's name. She's a girl, and the name doesn't have a female version. She's been teased for it in school, and now at 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and would be mad if she does this, thinking it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy versus family tradition. The person is an adult, so she's legally able to make her own decisions. She's been using the nickname for a long time, and it's important for her to feel comfortable and authentic. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's well-being and identity are also significant. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects self-esteem and social interactions. The mother's reaction might be about tradition and memory, but the daughter's right to choose her identity is a strong argument. There's no indication she's trying to erase the grandfather's memory entirely, just that she wants her daily life to reflect her true self. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life, even if it upsets her family. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's autonomy is more important here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
