My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, which is causing them distress and mockery. They want to change it to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate and what friends use. Their mom is upset, thinking it disrespects the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was chosen by parents, but it's not a female version. The person has faced bullying because of it. Now, they're an adult, 21, engaged, and want to change their name. The mother is against it, but the person feels the nickname is their true name now.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults have the legal right to change their names. The mother's disapproval is a family issue, but the person's autonomy is important. The fact that they've used the nickname socially and the fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests it's part of their identity now. The original name causing ongoing harm (bullying) is a significant factor. The grandfather's memory is part of the parents' reasoning, but the person isn't rejecting the grandfather; they're just changing the name to fit their identity better. \n\nSo, balancing the mother's feelings against the person's well-being. Since they're an adult, their right to self-identify is crucial. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the person's decision isn't about forsaking the grandfather but about their own comfort and identity. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
