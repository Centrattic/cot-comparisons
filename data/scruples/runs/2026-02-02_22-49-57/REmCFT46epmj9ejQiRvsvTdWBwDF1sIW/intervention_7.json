My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author, a girl, was given a boy's name (like John) by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. The author has been teased about the name in school and now wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom isn't happy and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is 21 and engaged, with her fianc\u00e9 using the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was given with a specific intention (honoring the grandfather), but it's causing the author distress. The author has been using a nickname that feels more personal. The mother's opposition is about respecting the grandfather's memory, but the author is an adult making a personal choice. \n\nLegally, in many places, adults can change their names without family consent. So the author has the right to do this. Ethically, it's about autonomy versus family legacy. The author is seeking to align her legal identity with how she's been perceived socially, which can be important for self-identity and well-being. The mother's disapproval is significant, but the author's choice is her own. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests it's a meaningful part of her identity. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but the author isn't rejecting that entirely\u2014she's just changing her legal name to something that fits better. The mother's reaction might stem from feeling that changing the name disrespects the grandfather, but the author's well-being is also valid. \n\nSo putting this all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's an adult making a personal decision that affects her life. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the author's right to self-expression and comfort. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
