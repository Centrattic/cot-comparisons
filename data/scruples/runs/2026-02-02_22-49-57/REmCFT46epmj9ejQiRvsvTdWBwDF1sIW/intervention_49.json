My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a female one. The original name was given by the parents after the grandfather, and the current name is a male name that's causing teasing. The author wants to change both first and last names to a nickname based on their last name, which friends use. The mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and is upset about dishonoring the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 21 and engaged, so an adult. They've been using the nickname in social settings for a long time. The parents named them after the grandpa, but there's no female version. The issue is about name change and whether it's wrong to do so despite family disapproval.\n\nIn terms of rights, adults have the legal right to change their names. The emotional aspect is that the current name is causing distress due to teasing. The nickname is how they've identified themselves socially. The mom's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the author feels the nickname is more their identity now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to determine if changing the name is justified despite family disapproval. The author isn't being disrespectful to the grandfather by changing their name; they're choosing a name that aligns with their identity. Parents naming children is a common practice, but when the child is an adult, their right to choose their identity is important. The mother's reaction could be seen as dismissing the author's personal identity and social integration. The author isn't taking away the grandfather's name but creating a new identity that's comfortable for them. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
