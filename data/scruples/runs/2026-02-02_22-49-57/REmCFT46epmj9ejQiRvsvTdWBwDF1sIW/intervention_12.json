My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name they were given by their parents. The parents named them after the grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture, but the name is a short boy's name without a girl version. The person has been mocked for it in school, and now they want to change both their first and last names to a nickname that friends use. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasoning. They've been teased, which is a valid emotional impact. Using a nickname that's already associated with them socially and legally changing it might help with their self-identity. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, showing support. However, the parents are hurt because they see it as disrespecting the grandfather's memory.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should think about autonomy over one's name. In many places, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The parents' feelings are important, but the individual's right to self-identify is also a factor. The fact that the nickname is already used by friends and family suggests it's a natural extension of their identity. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the person is within their rights to make this change. The key points are the person's well-being versus honoring the grandfather's memory. It's a sensitive situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and comfort.\n"
