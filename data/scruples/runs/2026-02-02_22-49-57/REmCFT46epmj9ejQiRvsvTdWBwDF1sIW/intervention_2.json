My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name, given by their parents, to a female name that they've used as a nickname. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the name is a male one with no female equivalent. The author has been teased for it and is now 21 and engaged, wanting to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname derived from their current last name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's reasoning is that they've always used the nickname and feel it's more authentic. Their fianc\u00e9 also uses the nickname, which suggests it's been a consistent part of their identity. The parents are upset because they see it as forsaking the grandfather's memory. But the author is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. \n\nIn terms of moral or ethical wrongness, name changes are pretty common, especially when someone feels their name doesn't align with their identity or causes issues. The parents might feel disrespected, but the author is making a personal choice that affects their own life. The key here is that the author isn't necessarily being disrespectful; they're seeking comfort and authenticity in their own life. The parents' disapproval is unfortunate, but the author's right to self-determination is a strong point in their favor.\n\nAlso, the fact that the name was given with a gesture (honoring the grandfather) but doesn't have a female equivalent complicates things. The author isn't just rejecting the name for no reason; they've had to deal with teasing and it's part of their identity struggle. The fianc\u00e9's support adds to the legitimacy of the nickname as part of their identity now.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any cultural or familial norms that might weigh in. But the question is more about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the parents' feelings. Since the author is an adult, they have the autonomy to make this decision. The parents' upset is a result of the decision, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't causing harm to others, just making a personal choice for their own well-being and comfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're choosing a name that aligns with their identity and has been a part of their social identity for a long time. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their own comfort and authenticity.\n"
