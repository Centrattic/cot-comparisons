My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to legally change her name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which is a family tradition (after her grandfather), but she's been teased for it and wants to use a nickname instead. Her mom is upset, feeling it's disrespectful to her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to their own identity. Name changes are legal in many places, so the author has that right. She's been using the nickname for a long time, even in social circles, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests she's comfortable with it and it's part of her identity now.\n\nHer parents' disapproval is about honoring family tradition, which is valid, but does that outweigh her personal happiness and sense of self? The author isn't trying to erase her grandfather, just use a different name that fits her better. The key here is whether the name change is a personal choice versus a disrespect to family. Since the nickname is derived from her current last name and she's been using it publicly, it seems like a legitimate expression of her identity.\n\nAlso, the age factor: she's 21 and engaged, so it's her own decision to make. While family feelings are important, they shouldn't override someone's right to self-identify. The mother's reaction is strong, but the author's well-being and comfort with her name are significant. There's no indication she's being disrespectful, just seeking to use a name that feels authentic to her. \n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong. It's her life and her name to choose, even if it upsets family members. The key points are personal identity, legal rights, and the fact that she's been using the nickname for years, which supports her choice.\n"
