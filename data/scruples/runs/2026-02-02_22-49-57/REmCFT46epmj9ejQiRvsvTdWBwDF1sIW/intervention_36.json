My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, named after the grandfather. The name doesn't have a female version and has caused them to be teased. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname derived from their current last name. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking her grandfather's memory and she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to change their name. Legally, in most places, adults can change their names as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. So the person has the legal right here. The emotional aspect is about personal identity and comfort. They've been using the nickname socially for years, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. It seems like the nickname is more aligned with how they present themselves and how they're known in their community. That's important for self-identity and mental well-being, especially if they've faced teasing.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's perspective is about honoring family tradition and the grandfather's memory. The parents named the person after the grandfather, and the mother feels the new name disrespects that. But it's important to note that the person is an adult now. At 21, they have autonomy over their own name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't obligated to continue using a name that causes them distress. The key here is the balance between respecting family legacy and personal identity.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name despite the mother's disapproval. The answer hinges on whether respecting one's own identity and well-being takes precedence over family tradition. Since name changes are a personal choice for adults, especially when there's a history of bullying and the nickname has been part of their identity for years, it seems the person isn't in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person has the right to make decisions about their own name. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
