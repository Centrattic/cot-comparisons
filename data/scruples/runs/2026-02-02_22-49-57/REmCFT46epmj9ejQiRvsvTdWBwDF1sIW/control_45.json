My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The author is a girl named after her grandfather, but it's a male name like John, which she's been teased for. She wants to change her name to a nickname her friends use and her fianc\u00e9 uses. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by parents with a specific intention, but the author feels it's not suitable for her. She's been teased, which is a valid reason for wanting a change. The nickname is already used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, so it's her preferred identity now. At 21 and engaged, she's an adult making her own decisions. The mother's disapproval is a family conflict, but the author's right to self-identify her name is important. Legal name changes are possible for adults, so it's her choice. The grandfather's memory is part of the reason for the name, but the author might feel that using the nickname honors her own identity more. The mother's emotional response is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and personal identity. So the answer is B.\n"
