My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate. The parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name without a female version. The person has been teased for it and now wants to legally change their name to the nickname they've used for years. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family traditions. The person is an adult, 21 years old, so they have the legal right to change their name. The parents gave them a name, but that doesn't necessarily mean the child has to keep it. The name caused them distress and social issues, which is significant. The nickname they want to use is already part of their identity, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That shows they've integrated it into their life.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother feels like the name honors the grandfather, and changing it might be seen as disregarding that memory. But the original name was given with the grandfather's name, but it's a male name. The daughter might not have a female version to use, so creating a new name based on their last name could be a way to honor their roots while finding a name that fits their identity better.\n\nIs the author respecting her grandfather's memory? She's not necessarily rejecting his memory entirely, just changing how her name reflects her identity. The mother's disapproval is based on personal feelings, but the daughter's well-being and comfort in her own name is also important. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests it's part of her identity now.\n\nLegally, she can change her name. Ethically, it's about personal choice versus family expectations. Since she's an adult, her autonomy is key here. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the daughter's right to self-identify with a name that makes her comfortable is valid. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
