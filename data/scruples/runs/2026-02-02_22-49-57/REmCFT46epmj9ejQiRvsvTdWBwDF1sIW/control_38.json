My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine. Their parents gave them the name after their grandpa, but it's a boy's name. The person has been teased for it and is now planning to legally change both first and last names. The mother is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandpa's memory.\n\nFirst, the person's reasoning: they've used the nickname all their life, it's how friends and even the fianc\u00e9 address them. They feel it's more their name. The parents might disapprove, but the person is an adult now. At 21, they have autonomy over their name. The key points here are personal identity vs. family tradition. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their well-being. Being made fun of is a valid reason to seek a name change. The parents might feel hurt because the name was a tribute, but the person isn't rejecting the grandpa; they're just choosing a name that fits their identity better. The mother's disapproval might be more about her feelings than the grandfather's. \n\nThe question is whether the person is wrong. Since they're an adult, making decisions about their identity isn't wrong. The parents' feelings are important, but the person's right to self-identify is also valid. The name change isn't about disrespecting family but about personal comfort and social identity. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
