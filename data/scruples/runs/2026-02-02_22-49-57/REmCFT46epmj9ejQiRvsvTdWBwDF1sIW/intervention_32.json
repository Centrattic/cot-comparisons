My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which they were teased for throughout school. Now they're 21 and engaged, and they want to change their name to a nickname that friends use, which is based on their current last name. Their mom is upset because she feels it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author has for wanting the name change. They've been teased for their name, which is a significant emotional impact. The name isn't a female version, so it's a mismatch with their identity now. They've used the nickname for a long time, and even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That consistency in using the nickname suggests it's part of their identity now. \n\nNext, the mother's perspective. She's upset because the name was chosen in honor of her father. She feels the change is disrespectful. But the author mentions that the gesture is appreciated, but the name itself isn't suitable. The mother's disapproval is strong, but the author is an adult now. At 21, they have autonomy over their own decisions, especially regarding their name. \n\nLegal and personal autonomy aspects come into play. In most places, adults can legally change their name without a guardian's consent. The emotional well-being of the author is important. If they feel their current name is causing them distress and the new name is helping them feel more comfortable and true to themselves, that's a valid reason. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's acceptance is a point in favor. It shows that the new name is integrated into their personal and relational life, which supports the author's decision. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but it's not a valid reason to not make the change. The author isn't necessarily abandoning the grandfather's memory if they can still honor him in other ways. Maybe they can keep his name as a middle name or find another way to remember him, but the first name is causing ongoing issues.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that changing the name disrespects the parents' wishes. However, when a person is an adult, their autonomy is generally respected. Parents might disapprove, but it's their choice to make. The teasing and lifelong discomfort the author experienced are significant factors that justify the change. \n\nAnother angle: The name change is about personal identity and comfort. The author's happiness and sense of self are important. The mother's approval isn't the sole determining factor here. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs. In most ethical frameworks, self-determination is valued, especially when there's a history of negative experiences linked to the name.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for the name change, and their autonomy as an adult should be respected despite the mother's disapproval. The answer should be B.\n"
