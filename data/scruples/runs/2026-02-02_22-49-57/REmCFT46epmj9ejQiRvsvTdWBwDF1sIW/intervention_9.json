My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname based on their last name, which they've used socially. The parents gave them the name after their grandfather, and the mom is upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the memory. The author is 21, engaged, and the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for the name change. The author mentions being teased in school and that the nickname feels more like their own. Changing one's name, especially as an adult, is often a personal choice related to identity and comfort. The fact that the nickname is already used by friends and the fianc\u00e9 suggests it's a well-established part of their identity now.\n\nThe parents' perspective is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the author is using the nickname as their real name, not changing their last name to the grandfather's. The last name change is separate, possibly to their partner's or another name, which is a common choice when getting married. \n\nLegally, in many places, adults can change their names without consent, so the mom's disapproval might not hold legal weight. Ethically, it's about personal autonomy versus family tradition. The author has the right to choose their own name, especially if it affects their well-being. However, the emotional aspect of the parents' feelings is important. The author might need to navigate this carefully to maintain a good relationship, but the decision itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their identity and happiness, and name changes are personal. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name they feel doesn't represent them, especially if it's causing distress.\n"
