My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name away from the male name her parents gave her, which was after her grandfather. She's being teased for it, and she's using a nickname that her friends know her by. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name. The author is 21 and engaged, planning to go with the nickname as her name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family traditions. The author was given a name that's a male name, and she's been using a nickname that aligns with her gender identity. If the name is causing her distress and she's been using this nickname for a long time, it's about her identity and comfort. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests that it's her preferred name in her personal life.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture, but the author feels it's not the female version. That might be a point where the parents didn't consider the gender aspect when choosing the name. The key here is that the author is an adult now, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own name. Even though her mom is upset, the author's well-being and authenticity might take precedence.\n\nThe fact that she's been teased for her name in school adds to the emotional impact. Changing her name could be a way to avoid further harassment and to live more authentically. The mother's disapproval is a family conflict, but it doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. Autonomy in adulthood is a big factor here. People can choose their names regardless of family disapproval, especially when it affects their mental health and social interactions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life, and it's her right to choose a name that feels true to her, even if it means disappointing her parents. The answer should be B (No).\n"
