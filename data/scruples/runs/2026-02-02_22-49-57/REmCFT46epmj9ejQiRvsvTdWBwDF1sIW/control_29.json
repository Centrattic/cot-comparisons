My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a male name (like John) by their parents, after their grandpa, but they're a girl and want to change it to a nickname version of their last name. Their mom is against it, saying it's forsaking their grandpa's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult. They've been teased about their name in school. They've used a nickname for a long time. Their fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname. The mother is upset and doesn't approve. The parents named them after the grandpa, but didn't use a female version. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, adults have the right to change their names. The person is seeking to align their name with how they're known socially. Being teased is a valid reason for wanting to change. The mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but that might be a cultural or family tradition. However, the person's well-being and comfort in their own name is important. The mother's disapproval is significant, but if the person is making the choice as an adult, their autonomy is key. \n\nSome might say the person should respect the family tradition, but others would argue that they have the right to their own identity. The fact that they've always used the nickname and their partner does too suggests that the new name is part of their identity now. The mother's reaction could be about the emotional attachment to the grandfather, but it's the person's name to choose. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal choice that affects their life, and being an adult, they have the right to do so. The mother's disapproval doesn't make it right or wrong for the person themselves. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
