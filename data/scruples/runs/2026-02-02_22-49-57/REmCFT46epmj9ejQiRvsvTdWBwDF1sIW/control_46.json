My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author, a woman, was given a traditionally male name (like John) by her parents, after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mother is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person wants to change their name to something that feels more like their own identity. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The parents named her after her grandfather, but there's no female version, leading to a name that's not matching her gender. The mother's reaction is disapproval and anger.\n\nThe main issue here is personal identity vs. family traditions. The author has a right to choose her name, especially if it affects her well-being and self-image. Being teased for a name that doesn't fit her gender identity (assuming she's female) is a valid reason. The parents' intention was good, but the result has caused her distress. Changing her name to better align with her gender expression is a personal choice. While the mother's feelings are hurt, the author's autonomy is important. So, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
