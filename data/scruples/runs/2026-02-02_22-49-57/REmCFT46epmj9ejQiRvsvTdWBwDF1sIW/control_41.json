My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person (a woman) is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name that her parents gave her, which was named after her grandfather. She's been teased because of it, and now she wants to legally change her name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights. In the US, you can legally change your name for any reason, as long as you're not trying to evade legal issues. So from a legal standpoint, she's not in the wrong. She's an adult, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own body and identity.\n\nThen there's the emotional and familial aspect. Her parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. Discontinuing that name might hurt them, but it's also important for her well-being. If she's been teased and it's affecting her self-esteem, changing her name could be a positive step. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which probably adds to her comfort in using that name.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is significant, but the daughter is an adult. While respecting her parents' feelings is important, she's within her rights to make this change. The key point is that she's not harming others, just making a personal choice to feel more comfortable. The grandfather's memory isn't erased by the name change; it's more about how she identifies now versus how her parents remember the past.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her own happiness and comfort, which is valid. The mother's feelings are important, but the daughter's autonomy takes precedence here.\n"
