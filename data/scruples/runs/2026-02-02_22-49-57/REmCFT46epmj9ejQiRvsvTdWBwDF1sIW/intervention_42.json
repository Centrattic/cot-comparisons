My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname they've used socially, which is based on their last name. The parents named them after the grandfather, but it's a boy's name and they've been teased for it. The mom is upset and says the author is forsaking the memory of the grandpa.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and personal rights aspect. In many places, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The author is 21, so they're an adult, and this is their right. The parent's disapproval is a personal opinion, but doesn't override the adult's choice. \n\nThen, the emotional side. The author has been made fun of because of the name, which is a significant reason. They feel the nickname is more like their actual name, and even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests a strong personal connection and comfort with the new name. The grandfather was named John, but the author isn't directly using his name; they're using a nickname based on their last name. The parent might feel this is disrespectful, but the author is honoring the gesture by choosing a name that aligns with their identity.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The parent's reaction is disapproval and anger, but unless there's a cultural or religious context where the name change is a direct affront, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice that affects their own identity and well-being. It's their autonomy. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a deeper reason the parent is upset. The parent might have a sentimental attachment to the grandfather's name. The author could consider explaining their perspective and perhaps finding a compromise, but the question is about right or wrong. Since the parent's disapproval is based on personal feelings and the author has valid reasons, including legal rights and personal comfort, the answer would likely be B. \n\nI should also think if there's any cultural context where the name is sacred. But the example given is \"John,\" which is common in many cultures. If the nickname is a derivative of the last name, it's still a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong for changing their name to reflect their identity and happiness.\n"
