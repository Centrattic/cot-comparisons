My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name from a male name they were given at birth to a nickname that's more in line with their identity as a girl. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version of the name. The name \"John\" is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing in school. Now at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name that friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). Let's break down the factors. The person has a right to choose their own name, especially as an adult. The original name was given by parents, but the individual's comfort and identity are important. The name caused them distress (bullying) and they've used the nickname socially for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 also uses the nickname, which suggests it's a stable part of their identity. The mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the individual is adult and autonomous. Name changing is a personal choice, and while the mother's feelings are valid, the person isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity. The fact that they explain the nickname as feeling more like their own name supports their decision. So, the answer is B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
