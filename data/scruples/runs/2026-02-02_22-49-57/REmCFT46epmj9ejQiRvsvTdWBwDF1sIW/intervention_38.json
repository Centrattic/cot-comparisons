My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The author was given a name that's typically male, like John, and she's been teased for it. Now she wants to use a nickname based on her last name, which her friends already use, and change her last name too. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandpa's memory. The author finds her nickname more personal and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual. In many places, people can legally change their names for personal reasons. The author is an adult, so she has the autonomy to decide her name. The fact that her parents named her after her grandfather is a family tradition, but she's choosing to honor herself. The mother's disapproval is about the family name, but that doesn't negate the daughter's right to self-identify. Also, the author mentions being teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change for her well-being. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows social acceptance. The mother's stance seems more about tradition and possibly not respecting the daughter's autonomy. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
