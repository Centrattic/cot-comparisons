My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she wants to change her name from a male name (like John) that her parents gave her after her grandfather, to a nickname that her friends use, which is more feminine. Her mom is upset and says she would never accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to change their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names for any reason they choose. So if she's 21 and wants to change her name, that's her legal right. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which she appreciates the gesture, but the name is a boy's name and she's a girl. There's no female version, so she's been teased for it. That's a problem. She's been using a nickname that friends know her by, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname. So changing her name to that nickname makes sense for her identity and comfort. \n\nHer mom's reaction is disapproving, saying she won't accept the new name and that it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's wrong for going ahead despite her mom's disapproval. \n\nI think the key points here are her right to self-identify and the impact of name change on her well-being. If the name has caused her distress and she's using a nickname that represents her better, changing it could be positive. However, the conflict with her family is a factor. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not whether there's a conflict. \n\nHer parents chose the name, but it's not like they forced her to use it. She's an adult now and has the autonomy to decide her name. Her mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own identity and happiness. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
