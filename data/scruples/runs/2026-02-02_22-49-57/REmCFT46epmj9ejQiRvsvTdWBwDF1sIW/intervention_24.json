She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing her name. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a boy's name, like \"John.\" She's been teased for it in school. Now she's 21 and engaged, and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name, which her friends have used. Her mom is really upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and that she thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rights of an adult to make decisions about their own name. At 21, she's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name if she wants. That's probably a key point. People often change their names for various reasons, like personal identity, avoiding discrimination, or personal preference.\n\nThen, the reason she's changing her name is because she's been teased for a name that doesn't fit her gender. That's a valid concern. If a name is causing her distress or being a source of bullying, changing it could be a reasonable choice to improve her quality of life. Especially since she's already using a nickname that works better for her, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name too. It seems like she's been using that name socially for a while, so making it official might just formalize something that's already part of her identity.\n\nHer mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather. The mom feels that changing the name is disregarding his memory. But does the author have to keep the name to honor her grandfather? Maybe the grandfather would have wanted her to be happy, or maybe the author's personal well-being is more important. There's a balance between respecting family history and individual choice. While the mother's feelings are valid, the author is entitled to make her own decisions about her identity.\n\nAlso, the name was given by her parents as a gesture, but they didn't use the female version. That might mean the name wasn't a perfect fit from the start. The fact that it's a short, traditionally male name without a girly nickname could make it more prone to teasing. So her choice to change it isn't just about rejecting her grandfather's name, but about finding a name that suits her better.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Adults can make decisions about their names, and her reasons seem legitimate. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to proceed. People have different priorities, and her focus on her own comfort and social acceptance is her prerogative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that affects her own life and well-being, and the reasons she's given are valid. The mother's opinion is important, but the author's autonomy as an adult takes precedence here.\n"
