My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name. The person was given a male name (like \"John\") by their parents, which they feel is not suitable for them as a girl. They've been teased for it, and now they want to change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their current last name. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been made fun of their whole life, which is tough. Using a nickname that feels more like their own makes sense for their identity and happiness. They're an adult now, so they have the right to make decisions about their name. The parents' disapproval is a factor, but does that mean the person is wrong? Not necessarily. Family disagreements happen, especially around such personal matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents named them after the grandfather, which might hold sentimental value for the family. The mom's reaction is strong\u2014she says she'll never accept the new name and would be mad. But the person argues that the nickname is already how they're known socially and by their fianc\u00e9. That suggests the name change isn't just about rebellion but about aligning with their true self and how they're perceived in their community.\n\nI think the key points here are autonomy and well-being. Adults have the legal right to change their names. The person's mental health and comfort in their own identity are important. The parents might feel disrespected, but the person isn't obligated to keep a name that's caused them distress. So the author isn't in the wrong for changing their name despite family disapproval. Answer B.\n"
