My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a female one. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was named after their grandfather with a traditionally male name (like \"John\"). They never had a female version or a nickname that felt right, leading to teasing. Now, at 21 and engaged, they want to change both first and last names to a nickname that friends use, which is more gender-appropriate. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory, but the author has always used the nickname socially, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. Let's consider the key points. The name was given with a specific intention (honoring the grandfather), but the name is causing distress and social issues. The person is an adult and has the right to choose their own name. The mother's disapproval is significant, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nIn many cultures, especially in the West, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The author is addressing their own identity and well-being, which is important. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's autonomy is also a right. The fact that the nickname has been used for a long time suggests it's a genuine reflection of their identity. The mother's disapproval might be emotional, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author should have considered their grandfather's legacy more. But the author does acknowledge the gesture, just wants their own identity. Also, the mother's reaction is strong, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. People can have different views on name changes without being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're making a personal choice to align their name with their identity and well-being, which is a valid decision.\n"
