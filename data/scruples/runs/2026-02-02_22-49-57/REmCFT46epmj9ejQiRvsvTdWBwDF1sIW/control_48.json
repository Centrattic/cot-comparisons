My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a traditionally male name by their parents, named after the grandfather, but now as an adult, they want to change it to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate and that friends use. The parents disapprove, especially the mom, who says she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names for personal reasons. The fact that they were given a name that doesn't fit their gender identity or cause them distress is a valid reason. The person mentions being made fun of in school, which adds to the emotional impact. Using a nickname that friends already use suggests it's a natural extension of their identity. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also shows acceptance in their personal life.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' feelings are hurt because they see it as disrespecting the grandfather. But as the person is now an adult, their autonomy is key. Parents can have their feelings, but the adult child has the right to make decisions about their own identity. The parents might need time to adjust, but the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and self-identity. The nickname is part of their personal expression, especially if the original name doesn't suit them. So, the answer would lean towards the person not being in the wrong. They are asserting their identity, which is important, even if it upsets family members.\n"
