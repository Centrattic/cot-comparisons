My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The author's parents named her after her grandfather with a boy's name, \"John,\" which she's been teased for. She wants to change her name to a nickname her friends use, which is based on her last name. Her mom is upset and doesn't approve, saying it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In most places, adults can legally change their names for any reason. The author is 21 and engaged, so she's an adult making her own decisions. Her parents' disapproval is a personal issue, but they can't stop her legally.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. The author has been teased, which is a valid reason for wanting a name that makes her feel more comfortable. Her husband-to-be uses the nickname, which supports her choice. The parents might feel hurt, but respecting her autonomy is important. It's about her identity and well-being versus her parents' feelings.\n\nHowever, the grandfather's memory is mentioned. The parents named her after him, so changing the name might feel like disrespect. But the author is using the nickname as a tribute in a way, maybe keeping part of the last name alive. It's a balance between honoring the past and embracing her identity.\n\nSo, the key points: legal right to change name, her comfort and self-identity, parents' feelings, and the grandfather's memory. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's making a choice that affects her life. The parents are upset, but that doesn't make her wrong. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
