My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a girl with a name that's typically a boy's name, like John. Her parents named her after her grandfather, but there's no female version of that name. She's been teased for it in school and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather. The author wants to go ahead anyway because she's always used the nickname socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about identity, autonomy, and family dynamics. The author is an adult, 21, so she's legally able to make decisions about her name. She's been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests it's her preferred name. The issue with her parents is emotional\u2014they feel she's disrespecting her grandfather. But the author's reasoning is about her own comfort and how others perceive her, especially given the teasing she's faced.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal autonomy versus family tradition. The author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily immoral. Changing one's name is a common practice for various reasons, including personal identity. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to choose her name shouldn't be questioned if she's making the choice for herself, not to disrespect her grandfather. However, it's important to consider the emotional impact on family, but the author's own well-being and how she identifies are also valid.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's making a choice that affects her life, and while it might cause family tension, the choice itself isn't inherently wrong. The mother's disapproval is about her feelings, not the author's rights. The author is in her right to change her name to reflect her identity and comfort, even if it upsets her parents. Therefore, the answer would be B, Not in the wrong.\n"
