My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing their name from a male name they were given by their parents, which was named after their grandfather, to a nickname they've used since school. The parents disapprove, especially the mom, who feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The person is 21, engaged, and wants to change both first and last name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person was given a male name by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The name is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing in school. They've used a nickname all along, which their fianc\u00e9 uses, and now want to legally change it. The mom is upset, thinking it's disrespectful to the grandfather.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name despite the disapproval. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nIn terms of rights, people generally have the right to change their names for personal reasons. The parents' disapproval might be a personal issue but doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. The person is an adult, so they have autonomy over their name. The grandfather's memory is important, but the name was given by the parents, not the grandfather himself. The person is seeking to use a name that feels more authentic to them, which is a common reason for legal name changes.\n\nThe mother's perspective is about respecting family tradition and the grandfather's memory, which is valid, but the child's well-being and comfort in their own skin is also important. The name change is a personal choice, and while it might hurt the mother, the person isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own identity and happiness.\n\nThe fact that they've used the nickname socially for a long time suggests it's a part of their identity that's been accepted by friends and partner. The parents might need time to adjust, but the person isn't in the wrong for making this change. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
