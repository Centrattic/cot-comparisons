My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which they've been teased about. They want to change it to a nickname that feels more like their own, but their mom is upset and says they're disrespecting their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the person has for changing their name. They mentioned being teased throughout school, which can have a significant impact on self-esteem. Using a nickname that friends and their fianc\u00e9 use sounds like a way to feel more authentic. The parents named them after the grandfather, but didn't adjust for gender, which might have been an oversight. The person likes the gesture but the name doesn't fit.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother feels it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. There's a cultural aspect here; names often carry family legacy. But the individual's well-being and identity are also important. The person is 21 and engaged, so it's their adult life, and they have the right to make decisions about their identity.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. family tradition. While respecting family is important, the individual's right to self-identify is also a valid consideration. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's desire to avoid ongoing distress from being called a name they don't identify with is understandable.\n\nLegally, one can change their name, so the person isn't breaking any laws. Morally, it's about balancing respect for family with personal identity. Since the nickname is already used and accepted by friends and the fianc\u00e9, it's a practical choice for consistency and personal happiness. The mother's disapproval is a personal issue that doesn't override the person's right to choose their name.\n\nSo, I think the person isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons rooted in their personal experience and identity. The answer should be B.\n"
