My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person (a girl) is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name given by her parents to a nickname that feels more like hers. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: her parents named her after her grandfather, but didn't use a female version. The name is a common male name like \"John,\" and she's been teased for it. Now she's 21, engaged, and considering changing both her first and last names. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and friends have always called her by it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the answer is A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nKey points to consider: Autonomy over one's name is a personal choice. The name was given without a female counterpart, leading to teasing. She's an adult now, so the right to change her name for her comfort and identity is important. The mother's disapproval is about family tradition, but the author's well-being is also a factor. The fianc\u00e9 and friends using the nickname show that this name is more aligned with how she's known. Her mom's reaction is emotional, but the author's reasons are practical and personal. \n\nIn many cases, changing one's name to reflect their identity or avoid distress is seen as valid. Unless there's a legal or cultural context that complicates it, the person isn't in the wrong. The mother's perspective is about tradition and legacy, but the individual's need for self-identity and comfort is also significant. \n\nSo, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing a name that better represents her identity and eases her in social interactions, even if it goes against her parents' wishes.\n"
