My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name (like John) by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The author has always used a nickname instead and is considering changing their legal name now that they're 21 and engaged. The mother is upset, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an adult, which means they have the legal right to change their name. The name change is for personal identity and comfort, as they've been teased and have used the nickname their whole life. The parents' disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but that's their perspective, not the author's. The fianc\u00e9 supports the nickname, showing social acceptance.\n\nThe main factors here are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact on family relations. While changing the name might hurt the parents, the author has the right to choose their own name. The mother's reaction is about her feelings, but the author's well-being is also important. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity over their parents' wishes. Since the author is an adult, it's their decision. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
