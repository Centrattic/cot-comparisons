My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name (like John) by their parents, named after her grandfather. The name has caused her to be teased, and she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is considering changing it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if changing one's name is a personal choice. Legally, in most places, you can change your name without needing permission, so that's a point in her favor. The parents named her after her grandpa, but the female version wasn't used. The name is causing her distress and social issues. She's been using a nickname since childhood, which is how her fianc\u00e9 addresses her. The mother is upset, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe mother's feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify is also important. The name change is about her identity and well-being, which is a strong personal right. The parents giving a name that didn't fit her gender could be seen as a mistake, but they didn't intend malice. However, the author's happiness and comfort in her own skin are crucial. The mother's disapproval might be hurtful, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own needs. The nickname has been used for a long time, making it feel like her real name now. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
