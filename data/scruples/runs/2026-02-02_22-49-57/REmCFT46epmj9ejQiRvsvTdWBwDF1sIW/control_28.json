My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name away from the one given by their parents. The person is a girl who was named after her grandfather with a male name like \"John.\" She's been teased for it and wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom disapproves and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person was given a name that doesn't fit their gender, leading to ridicule. They've used a nickname socially for a long time. Changing the name now is a personal choice, especially since they're an adult. The mother is upset, but that's her reaction, not necessarily making the daughter wrong.\n\nLegal rights: In many places, adults can change their names without permission. The parents' name choice might have a cultural context, but the individual's well-being and comfort should matter. The mother's disapproval is personal, but the daughter isn't obligated to keep the name to please her. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, showing support.\n\nEthically, respecting one's identity and comfort is important. The name change is to align with how they identify and live their life. The mother's view about honoring the grandfather is a sentiment, but it's not a valid reason to prevent the daughter from using her chosen name.\n\nPossible arguments against: Maybe cultural traditions or family legacy. But the daughter's right to self-identify and avoid discrimination (like bullying) is stronger. The name change is for her own benefit and happiness.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's acting in her own best interest, and the mother's disapproval doesn't negate that right.\n"
