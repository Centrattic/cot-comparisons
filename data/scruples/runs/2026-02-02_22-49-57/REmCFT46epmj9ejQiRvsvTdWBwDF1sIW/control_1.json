My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman named \"John,\" which is traditionally a male name. Her parents named her after her grandfather, but they didn't use the female version. She's been teased for her name and wants to change it to a nickname that's more gender-neutral and what friends call her. Her mom is upset, thinking she's dishonoring her grandfather. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to change her name.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or just personal preference. In this case, the woman has been using a nickname that's more aligned with her identity and is considering making it official. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests she's comfortable with it. Her parents' disapproval is significant, but does that make her wrong?\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which shows they had a meaningful reason. However, the original name has caused her distress and social issues. The key here is whether honoring her grandfather's memory requires her to keep a name that's causing her problems. It's possible to honor someone's memory in different ways, not just by keeping their name. \n\nThe mother's reaction is emotional, but the daughter's well-being is also important. Name changes can affect someone's sense of identity and mental health. If changing the name helps her feel more authentic and less targeted, that's a valid reason. However, there's a balance between personal choice and respecting family history. But ultimately, the decision to change one's name is a personal right, and disapproval from family doesn't make it wrong. So, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
