My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more in line with her identity. The parents named her after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In most places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission, so that's a point in her favor. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too shows that this is a personal choice that's important to her identity.\n\nThen there's the family aspect. The mother is upset, feeling like the granddaughter is dishonoring the grandfather by changing the name. However, the author mentions that the original name was a male name without a female version, which might not have been a good fit from the start. The parents might have known that, but they chose the name anyway. The author is now asserting her own identity, which is a common reason for name changes.\n\nThe key factors here are personal identity versus family tradition. While family feelings are important, the author's right to self-identify is also significant. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and happiness. The teasing she's faced adds to the justification for changing her name.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that aligns with her identity and personal comfort, which is valid even if it upsets her family. The mother's feelings are important, but they don't override the author's rights as an adult.\n"
