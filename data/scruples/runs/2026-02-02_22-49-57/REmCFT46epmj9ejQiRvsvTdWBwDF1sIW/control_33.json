My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, which is similar to their grandfather's name. They've faced teasing for it and now want to use a nickname as their legal name when they get married. Their mom is upset because she feels they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Using a nickname that friends and even their fianc\u00e9 use could be important for their identity and comfort. The right to choose one's name is a personal choice, and especially in adulthood, they might have the autonomy to make that decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents chose the name with a specific intention, honoring their grandfather. The mother's disapproval stems from feeling that the new name forsakes that memory. It's about family tradition and respect for ancestors. But the author might not feel the same connection to the original name, especially if it's caused them distress.\n\nI should also think about cultural and societal norms. In many places, changing one's name is a personal right, especially if it's for personal identity and well-being. The age of the author (21) is relevant because they're an adult now, so their autonomy is a key factor. However, the emotional impact on the family is also important.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to self-identify, the history of teasing and its impact, the fianc\u00e9's use of the nickname, and the mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite their reasons.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the decision is about their own identity and comfort. While the mother's feelings are valid, the author has the right to choose a name that reflects who they are. The nickname has been used for years, showing it's a long-standing personal preference. The mother's disapproval doesn't negate the author's right to change their name for personal reasons.\n"
