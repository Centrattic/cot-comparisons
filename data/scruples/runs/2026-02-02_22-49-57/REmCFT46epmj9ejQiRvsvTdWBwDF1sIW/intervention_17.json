My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is a woman who wants to change her name from a male name, \"John,\" given by her parents, to a nickname derived from her last name. Her parents named her after her grandfather, but didn't adjust it for her being female. She's faced bullying because of her name, and now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last name. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. She's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name. The name she was given has caused her distress and social issues. Using a nickname that friends have used for years makes sense as a transition. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests it's well-established and part of her identity now. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a sentimental reason for the name, honoring her grandfather. Disapproval from family can be hurtful, but it's important to balance their feelings with the individual's right to self-identify. The parents' disapproval might be valid in terms of their feelings, but does that make the person in the wrong? The question is whether changing her name is a justified action despite family disapproval.\n\nLegally and culturally, people often change names for various reasons\u2014personal identity, avoiding discrimination, etc. In many places, adults can legally change their names without needing family consent. The key points here are the individual's well-being and autonomy versus familial expectations. Since she's not harming anyone else and is seeking to be more comfortable with her identity, it's more about her right to self-determination. The parents' disapproval is a consequence, but it doesn't negate her right to make the change. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking steps to align her legal identity with her self-perception and social identity, which is a common and valid choice. The answer should be B.\n"
