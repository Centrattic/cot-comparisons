My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name (like \"John\") given by her parents to a nickname based on her last name. The parents named her after her grandfather, which she appreciates but it's causing her issues because the name is a short male name with no girly nickname. She's been teased and now wants to change both her first and last names. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and feels the author is disrespecting her grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: She's had a hard time with the name, been mocked, and the nickname is how she's been known. The fianc\u00e9 uses it, so she's comfortable with it. Changing her name is for her own identity and happiness. The mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the author isn't doing this out of spite; it's about her well-being.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she can change her name as an adult. Emotionally, she's prioritizing her own experience. Parents might feel hurt, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name that causes her distress. The grandfather's memory isn't erased by the name change. The mother's reaction is tough, but the author's right to self-identify is key here. Since she's an adult and the name change is for her own reasons, it's more about her autonomy. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
