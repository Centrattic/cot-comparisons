My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing her name from a traditionally male name to a nickname that's more in line with her gender identity and personal preference. The parents named her after the grandfather, a male name, and she's facing disapproval from her mom for changing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 21 and engaged, so she's an adult. The name given at birth was a male name, which led to her being teased. Using a nickname that friends know her by is important to her identity now. The mother is upset because it's seen as forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nI think the main factors here are autonomy and personal identity. Adults have the right to choose their names, especially if the original name causes them distress. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests it's a significant part of how she identifies. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's right to self-identify might outweigh familial expectations. The grandfather's memory is important, but the name change isn't necessarily forsaking it; it's about her own comfort and identity. So, I don't think she's in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
