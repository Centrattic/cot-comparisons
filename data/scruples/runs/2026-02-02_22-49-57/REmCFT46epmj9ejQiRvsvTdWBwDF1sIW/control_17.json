My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which she's been teased for. She wants to use a nickname based on her last name as her legal name now. Her mom is upset because it's about honoring her grandfather. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's autonomy. People generally have the right to choose their own names, especially as adults. The name was given by parents, but once you're 21, you can make your own decisions. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too suggests it's important to her identity.\n\nThen there's the family aspect. The mother is upset about forsaking her grandfather's memory. But the original name was a male name; the author is a girl. The parents didn't give a female version, which might have caused the problem. The author changing her name could be seen as reclaiming her identity rather than disrespecting the grandfather.\n\nAlso, the teasing she faced in school is a valid reason. Mental health and well-being are important. If changing her name helps her feel more comfortable and stops the teasing, that's a good reason. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's right to self-identify is a personal choice.\n\nThere's no clear legal wrong here. The mother's feelings are hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong for choosing a name that suits her. The key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact on her life. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
