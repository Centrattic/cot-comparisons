My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the person was given a male name (like John) by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The person is a girl and has been teased for the name. She wants to change her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult (21) and engaged, so it's about her personal choice now. The parents gave a name that's a male name, without a female equivalent. The nickname has been used socially, so it's her preferred name. The mother is against it, but the person is choosing to go through with the change despite that.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the general consensus would be that adults have the right to choose their names, especially if it's important for their identity and well-being. The fact that she's been teased and the name doesn't fit her gender could be significant factors. Also, the nickname is already established, and the fianc\u00e9 uses it, so it's part of her identity. The mother disapproves, but it's her life. However, there's the aspect of honoring the grandfather. But the original name was a male name, so maybe the grandfather's memory is tied to the name, but the person is a woman. The mother's reaction might be more about her own feelings rather than respecting her daughter's choice.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if someone is an adult making a life decision that affects their own life, they're not considered in the wrong, even if family members disapprove. The mother's disapproval doesn't override the daughter's right to change her name. The key is whether the action is wrong, not the mother's feelings. The person is changing both first and last names to something that's her own, which is a personal right. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
