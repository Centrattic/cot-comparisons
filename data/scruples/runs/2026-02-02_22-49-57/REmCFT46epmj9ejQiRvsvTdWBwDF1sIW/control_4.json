My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. The parent disapproves because the original name was after their grandfather. The person says they've been teased for the name and use the nickname socially, even the fianc\u00e9 uses it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of individuals to change their names. In many places, you can legally change your name if you want, especially as an adult. The parent's disapproval is an emotional issue, but the person is an adult making their own choices. The fact that the name caused them distress and they've been using the nickname for a long time supports their desire to change it.\n\nHowever, the parent feels the name honors their grandfather. The person isn't rejecting the grandparent entirely but is using a variation that's more fitting for them. The key here is autonomy versus family tradition. The person's well-being and personal identity might take precedence over family objections once they're an adult.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They have the right to choose their name, especially for their own comfort and identity. The parent's feelings are valid but not a reason to keep someone from changing their name. The person isn't dishonoring the grandparent by using a related nickname; they're adapting it to fit their gender identity and personal image.\n"
