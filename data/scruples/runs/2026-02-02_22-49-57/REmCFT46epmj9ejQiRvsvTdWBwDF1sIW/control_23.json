My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a girl named \"John,\" which is a male name, given by her parents after her grandfather. She's been teased for it, and now she wants to legally change her name to a nickname that her friends and fianc\u00e9 use. Her mom is upset, thinking she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice. People can choose names that reflect their identity. The original name was a male name without a female version, leading to teasing. That's a valid reason for wanting a change. The mother's concern is about honoring the grandfather, but the person's well-being and comfort are also important. The nickname has been used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, indicating it's a name she's connected with socially. \n\nThe mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person has the right to make decisions affecting her own life, even if family disagrees. There's no legal wrongdoing here, just a personal choice. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
