My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name. Their original name is a male name from their grandfather, but they've always used a nickname as their name. The parents disapprove, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The person is 21, engaged, and wants to formalize the nickname as their legal name.\n\nFirst, the person has been teased for their name in school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. Mental health and well-being are important. Also, using a nickname that friends know them by makes sense for identity. The parents are upset, but they're an adult now. At 21, they have the legal right to change their name without needing parental approval. So the parents' disapproval doesn't make the person wrong in their decision.\n\nThe key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the impact of the name on their life. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also supports the idea that this is their preferred name. The parents' feelings are hurt, but the person's right to self-identify as an adult is a stronger factor here. So the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
