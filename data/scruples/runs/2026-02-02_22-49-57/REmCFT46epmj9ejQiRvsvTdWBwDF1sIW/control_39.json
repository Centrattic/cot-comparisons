My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, especially since it was named after their grandfather. The parents didn't use the female version, and the name is causing issues because it's a short male name without a girly nickname. The person is 21 and engaged, wanting to use a nickname as their legal name. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been teased in school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. That suggests the name is more personal now. However, the parents named them after the grandfather, which is a family tradition. The mom's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather.\n\nBut the person is an adult, so they have the right to make personal decisions. The name was given with a specific intention, but if it's causing distress and the person wants to change it, that's their choice. The fact that there's no female version might add to the conflict. The key points are autonomy versus family tradition. Legally, adults can change their names, so the person isn't in the wrong for that. Emotionally, the mom is hurt, but the person's well-being is also important. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
