My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The person was named after their grandfather, but it's a male name with no female equivalent. They've faced teasing and want to use a nickname as their legal name. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The person has been teased for a name they don't identify with. They're an adult now, 21, and changing their name is their legal right. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The mom is upset because of the grandfather's memory. But the person feels the nickname is more their identity. \n\nIn the US, adults can legally change their names for any reason. So the right to do so isn't in question. The mother's feelings are hurt, but the person has the autonomy. The mother's disapproval might be valid, but does that make the person in the wrong? The question is about being in the wrong, not about the mother's feelings. The person is acting in their own interests, which is acceptable. The answer would be B, No, because the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their name, even if family disapproves. The mother's feelings are valid, but that doesn't make the person wrong. The name change is about their identity and well-being.\n"
