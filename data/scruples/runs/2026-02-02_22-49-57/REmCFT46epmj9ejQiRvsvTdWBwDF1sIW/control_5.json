My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. They mention that their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The person has been teased for the name, is 21 and engaged, and wants to change both first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name despite their mom's disapproval. Let's consider the factors here. The person has been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting a name change. They've used the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. This suggests that the nickname is important to their identity now. The parent's concern is about honoring the grandfather, but the person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely\u2014they\u2019re just changing the name to something that better fits them.\n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice. While respecting family is important, the individual's right to self-identify their name is significant. The parent's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. They're not erasing the grandfather's name entirely, just creating a new name that works for them. The fact that they've been using the nickname socially indicates that they're comfortable with it, which supports their decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid personal reasons, their identity is involved, and they're not harming others except their parent's feelings, which is a tough spot but not necessarily being in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
