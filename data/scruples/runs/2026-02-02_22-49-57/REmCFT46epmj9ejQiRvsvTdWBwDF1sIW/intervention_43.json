My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that they were given a male name, John, after their grandfather, but now they want to change it to a female nickname they've used. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking they're forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. They mentioned using the nickname socially for a long time, even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. Changing their name could help them feel more comfortable and avoid further harassment. That seems important for their well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents gave the name with a specific intention, honoring the grandfather. The mom feels the new name disrespects that memory. But the person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely; they're just not using the name that was given. The parents had the option to choose a female version, which they didn't, so maybe there's some responsibility there too.\n\nLegal and personal rights are a factor. In many places, adults can legally change their names without family consent. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're of age to make this decision. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but it's her choice to disapprove, not something the person is at fault for.\n\nThe core issue is autonomy versus family tradition. The person has a right to choose their own name, especially if it's affecting their mental health and social interactions. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own needs and happiness.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
