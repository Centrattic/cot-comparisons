My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that their parents gave them a male name, \"John,\" which they've been teased for. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name, which they've used socially. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been dealing with teasing, which is a valid issue. Using a nickname that feels more like their own can be important for self-identity and comfort. The fact that their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname shows support, which is a positive sign.\n\nThen, the parents' side. The mom feels the name honors the grandfather, and changing it might feel like a rejection of that legacy. But the person isn't changing it out of disrespect; they're trying to align their name with their identity and reduce the negative attention they've faced.\n\nLegally, in many places, adults can change their names without parental consent. The key here is autonomy. At 21, the individual has the right to make decisions about their own name. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but it doesn't override the person's right to self-identify. Also, the nickname has been used by friends and family, making it a more personal identifier for them.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. The parents might feel hurt, but the person's reasons are valid. They aren't causing harm beyond familial tension, which is a common part of life when people make personal choices. The answer would likely be B (No, not in the wrong) because the decision is about personal identity and well-being, and the parents' disapproval, while significant, doesn't make the person wrong.\n"
