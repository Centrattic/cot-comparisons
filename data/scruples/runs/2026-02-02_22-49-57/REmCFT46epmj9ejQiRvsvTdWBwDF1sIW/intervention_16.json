My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a male name like \"John\" with no feminine version. She's been teased for it and now wants to change her name to a nickname that her friends use and her fianc\u00e9 uses. Her mom is upset and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is 21 and engaged, so she's an adult now.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are: the name is causing her distress, she's being bullied because of it, and she's decided to change it. Her parents named her with good intentions, but the result is problematic. She's using the nickname already in social settings, so changing the legal name would just formalize that.\n\nI think that name change is a personal choice. Since she's an adult, she has the right to choose her name. The parents might feel hurt, but their disapproval doesn't negate her right to change it. The fact that her nickname is already established and used by her fianc\u00e9 and friends supports her choice. The grandfather's memory is important, but the name given wasn't a good fit for her. Maybe the parents should have considered a name that works for both genders, but that's hindsight. The key here is her well-being versus the parents' feelings. Since she's been teased and is now making a decision that affects her own identity, I think she's justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
