My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who wants to change her name from a male name that her parents gave her, which was named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it in school and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to use a nickname that's based on her current last name, which her friends have always used. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for changing her name. The user thinks she's not in the wrong. Let me consider the factors here. \n\nFirst, the name was given by the parents as a tribute to the grandfather, but they didn't use the female version. That could be part of the issue. The name is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing. The person has always used a nickname, which her fianc\u00e9 uses. Now she's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name. \n\nHer mom's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather. But the person is the one living with the name and the consequences. It's her identity and how she wants to be known. The name change is about her comfort and how she's perceived. Since she's an adult, her parents' disapproval might not override her right to make this choice. \n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name is a personal decision, especially when it affects one's self-esteem and how others perceive them. The parents naming her after the grandfather was their choice, but she's now making a choice that's best for herself. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's autonomy is also important. \n\nI think the key points here are autonomy, impact on the individual, and the fact that the daughter is an adult. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
