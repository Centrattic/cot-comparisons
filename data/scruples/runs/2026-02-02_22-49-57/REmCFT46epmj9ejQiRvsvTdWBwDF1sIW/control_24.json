My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine, because they've been teased and their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. Their mom is upset because the original name was after their grandfather, and she thinks changing it is forsaking his memory.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are autonomy versus family tradition. The person is an adult, 21 and engaged, so they're making a personal choice about their identity. They've been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests it's meaningful to them. The parents gave the name with a gesture (honoring grandpa), but maybe without considering the gender aspect. The person is trying to align their name with how they present themselves, which is a common reason for name changes, especially if it's causing distress.\n\nThe mom's reaction is about honoring the grandfather's memory, but the person isn't erasing that memory entirely\u2014they're keeping the nickname based on the last name. The fact that friends and fianc\u00e9 use the nickname shows it's been accepted socially. The parents might feel hurt or disrespected, but the individual's right to self-identify is a strong point here. There's no mention of malice or disrespect towards the grandfather; it's more about personal comfort and identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're making a choice that affects their own life and happiness. The mother's disapproval is valid, but the person has the right to choose their name as an adult. The answer should be B.\n"
