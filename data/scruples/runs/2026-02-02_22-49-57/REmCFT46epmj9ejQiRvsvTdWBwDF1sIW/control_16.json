My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman named after her grandfather, but the name given is a male one like \"John.\" She's been teased for it, and she wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's dishonoring her grandfather. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, name choice is a personal decision. People often change their names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or personal preference. She's been using the nickname for years, and even her fianc\u00e9 uses it. That suggests she's comfortable with it and it's part of her identity now. The fact that she's an adult and engaged adds to her autonomy.\n\nHer parents gave her a name with a specific meaning (honoring her grandfather), but she's not rejecting the name entirely\u2014just the male version. She's keeping the connection through the nickname based on her last name. The mother's disapproval is about the name change, but the daughter's well-being and comfort in her own skin might outweigh the mother's feelings. \n\nBeing teased at school is a significant issue. Changing a name can help with self-esteem and social interactions, especially if it's been a long-term problem. The mother's perspective is valid, but it's important to consider the daughter's happiness and right to self-identify. \n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name is a personal choice, and family disapproval doesn't necessarily make it wrong. The daughter isn't erasing her grandfather; she's finding a name that fits her better while maintaining some connection. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
