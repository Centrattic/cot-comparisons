My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman named after her grandfather, but the name is a male name like \"John.\" Her parents didn't give her a female version, so she's been using a nickname that her friends use. She's been teased for the name in school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both her first and last name to that nickname. Her mom disapproves, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author feels the nickname is more \"her\" name and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nI need to consider if changing one's name is a personal choice. Legally, people can change their names for various reasons, including personal identity. The author's reasons here are both practical (being teased) and personal (using a name that feels more authentic). Her mother's disapproval is significant but does that make the author wrong? Family dynamics can be complex, but the right to change one's name is generally a personal decision. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's autonomy is also important. The fact that she's an adult and the name change affects her own identity and marriage suggests she isn't in the wrong. The key here is respecting personal autonomy versus family tradition. Since the author is making this choice for herself and her fianc\u00e9, and it's about her own identity, she's likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
