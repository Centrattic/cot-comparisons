  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA if I, a girl, change my name away from the one my parents gave me (a boy name)?\nMy parents named me after my grandpa, which, although I like the gesture, they didn't do the female version of it or anything. My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they prefer. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short, typically male name with no girly nickname. They've been teased for it and now want to change both their first and last names to a nickname based on their last name that friends use. Their mom is upset and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family traditions. The person is an adult, 21, so they have the legal right to change their name if they choose. The parents gave them a name, but that doesn't mean the person can't change it as an adult. The mother disapproves, but that's her opinion. The person's reasoning is that they've always used the nickname socially and even their fianc\u00e9 uses it. It's about their identity and comfort, which is a valid personal choice. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the person hasn't wronged anyone by making this change. They're not erasing their grandfather's memory, just choosing a name that fits them better. So, they're not in the wrong.\n"
