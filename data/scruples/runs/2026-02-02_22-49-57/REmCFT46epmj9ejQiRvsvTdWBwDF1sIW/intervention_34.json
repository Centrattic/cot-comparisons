My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which is a short version of a name that doesn't have a feminine counterpart. She's faced teasing because of it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname that friends use, even though her mom is upset about it.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the reasons for the name change. The author is dealing with teasing and wanting to use a name that feels more like her own. She mentions that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's a name she's used socially for a long time. Her mom's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the author is prioritizing her own comfort and identity.\n\nLegally, changing your name is usually a personal right unless there's some legal restriction. Emotionally, it's about self-identity versus family tradition. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author has her own reasons. She's not trying to erase the grandfather, just not use the name that's caused her issues. I think changing your name to something that aligns with your identity isn't wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
