My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that she has a male name given by her parents, which is a tribute to her grandfather. Now she wants to change it because it's causing her issues\u2014being made fun of, and she goes by a nickname. Her mom is upset and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the right to name oneself. People often change their names for various reasons like gender identity, personal preference, or to escape a problematic name. In this case, the name isn't matching her gender, which is a valid reason. The fact that she's been teased and used a nickname suggests she's been doing this for a long time, which might indicate she's more comfortable with the new name.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. However, the mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather. But does the daughter have the right to change her name even if it upsets her parents? Legally, adults can change their names. Ethically, it's more complex. While respecting family history is important, so is an individual's right to self-identify. The mother's reaction seems to be about the daughter not honoring the grandfather, but the daughter is using the nickname as her real name now. Maybe the grandfather would have understood or it's not about disrespecting him but about the daughter's comfort.\n\nThe fact that she's in a relationship and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also adds to the personal aspect. The key points are her well-being versus family tradition. Since she's an adult, her autonomy should be respected. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter isn't wrong for prioritizing her own identity and comfort. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
