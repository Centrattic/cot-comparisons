My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman was named after her grandfather, but the name is a male one, like \"John.\" She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's dishonoring her grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname already.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the person's right to change their name. In most places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission, as long as they follow the legal process. That's a basic right. Then there's the family conflict. The mother is upset because the name was chosen to honor the grandfather. The daughter's reasoning is that she's been using the nickname for a long time, it's more comfortable for her, and she's facing social issues because of her current name.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The mother's feelings are hurt, but the daughter is an adult. The name change affects the daughter's life and happiness. The grandfather's memory is important to the mother, but the daughter isn't erasing the grandfather\u2014she's just changing her own name. The mother might see it as disrespect, but others might see it as the daughter's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports her choice. The daughter's well-being and comfort in her own name is significant. So, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong. The mother's disapproval is valid, but the daughter's right to choose her name takes precedence. So the answer should be B.\n"
