My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) given by their parents, which was after their grandfather. They want to change it to a nickname derived from their current last name that they've used socially. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're adults now.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice, especially when it affects their well-being. They've been teased, which is a valid reason. The parents named them after the grandfather, but didn't adjust for a female version. The nickname is what they've used all along, so it feels more like their own identity now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too, showing it's integrated into their adult life.\n\nThe mom's disapproval is based on tradition and honoring the grandfather, but the person is making a choice that's important for their identity. While respecting family history is important, the individual's right to self-identify should take precedence here. The person isn't rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely; they just want a name that fits better. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
