My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who was given a male name (like John) by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. She's been teased about it in school and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which she's used socially. Her mom is upset, saying it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, personal preference, or to distance from a past. The fact that the name was a male name and caused her distress is a valid reason. Also, she's been using the nickname for a long time, so it's important to her identity. The fianc\u00e9's support is another point in her favor.\n\nHer mom's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the person isn't erasing the grandfather's memory\u2014she's just changing her own name. The parents chose the name initially without a female equivalent, so maybe they didn't consider her identity. The key here is personal autonomy versus family tradition. While family feelings matter, the individual's well-being and comfort in their chosen name should take precedence. So the answer is B.\n"
