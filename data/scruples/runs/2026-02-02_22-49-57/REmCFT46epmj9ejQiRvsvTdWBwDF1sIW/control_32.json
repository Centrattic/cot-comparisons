My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which is a short name like \"John\" with no feminine equivalent. This name has been a source of teasing in school. Now, at 21 and engaged, they want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname derived from their current last name, which their friends have used for them. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a significant emotional impact. They now want to use a name that feels more authentic to them, especially since their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. It's a personal choice about identity and comfort. The mom's reaction is about tradition and honoring family, but the person is an adult now. At 21, they have the legal right to make decisions about their name. The parents gave the name intending to honor their grandfather, but the person didn't choose that name and is facing real-life consequences from it. The mom's disapproval is about familial expectations, but the individual's well-being and personal identity might take precedence. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's feelings are valid. She might feel that the name is a tribute to her father, and changing it could feel like a rejection of that. However, the person is not erasing the grandfather entirely\u2014they're just changing their own name. The nickname is based on their last name, so maybe it's a way to maintain some connection. The key here is autonomy versus family tradition. The person is taking control of their identity, which is a common adult decision. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision is about personal identity and they're legally able to make that choice. The mom's disapproval is hurtful, but it doesn't make the person wrong for wanting to change their name.\n"
