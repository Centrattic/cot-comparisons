My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more feminine. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name doesn't have a female equivalent. They've been teased in school and now, at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last names using a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset and says she wouldn't accept the new name, thinking it forsakes their grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname already.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They're an adult, so the right to change their name is a personal choice. The name given by parents is important, but so is the individual's identity. They've faced bullying, which is a valid reason to seek a name change for their well-being. The nickname has been used by friends and their fianc\u00e9, indicating it's a name that represents their identity now. The mother's disapproval is about family tradition and honoring the grandfather, but the user is in their 20s, so they have autonomy here.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's feelings are valid. She might feel like the name change disregards the grandfather's memory. However, the user's happiness and comfort in their own skin are also important. The name change isn't about rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely but about finding a name that fits their identity better. There's a balance between respecting family history and personal identity. Since the user is an adult, they have the legal right to change their name, and the emotional impact of bullying versus familial approval needs to be weighed. The fianc\u00e9's use of the nickname shows that it's a practical and accepted name in their current life. The mother's disapproval doesn't make the user wrong; it's about differing values. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
