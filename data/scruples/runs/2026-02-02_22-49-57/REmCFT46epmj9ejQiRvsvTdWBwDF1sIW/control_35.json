My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine, which their friends use. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. The person has been teased for their name, and now they want to legally change it.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're at fault. Well, first, the name was given by their parents, but the individual is an adult now. At 21, they have the right to make decisions about their own name. The fact that their parents disapprove is a family issue, but the person is considering changing it for their own reasons\u2014like avoiding bullying and using a name that feels like theirs. Their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which supports their choice. \n\nAlso, legally changing your name is a common practice, especially when someone feels their name doesn't reflect their identity. The parents might feel hurt or think the person is dishonoring the grandfather's memory, but the individual's well-being and self-identity are important. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between respect for family and personal autonomy. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to change it. They are prioritizing their own comfort and happiness, which is valid. The parents' disapproval is unfortunate, but the decision to change the name is a personal one the person has the right to make. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
