My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a male name by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The person is female and has been teased for the name, which doesn't have a female equivalent. Now, at 21 and engaged, they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name, which friends use. The mom is upset, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to self-identify. At 21, they're an adult, so legally they can change their name. The parents' disapproval is a family issue, but the individual's well-being is important. Being teased and the name not fitting their gender identity or personal identity could be significant factors. The fact that they've used the nickname socially and their fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests it's meaningful to them. The parents' argument about honoring the grandfather is emotional, but the person's own experience of discomfort and the desire to feel more authentic might outweigh that. However, cultural or family traditions might play a role too. But since the person is an adult, their autonomy is key here. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to choose their name for personal reasons despite family disapproval.\n"
