My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the author, a woman, was given a boy's name (like John) by her parents, which they named after her grandfather. The name doesn't have a female version and she's been teased for it. Now she's 21 and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom disapproves, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an adult to change their name. In most places, adults have the legal right to change their name without needing family consent. So legally, she's not in the wrong. But the question is about whether she's morally or socially in the wrong. \n\nHer parents had the right to name her at birth, but she's an adult now. Changing her name is a personal choice, especially if it's causing her distress. The fact that her mother is upset is understandable, but the mother's approval isn't necessary for her decision. \n\nThe author mentions that she's always used the nickname in social settings, so the name change would be consistent with her identity. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which supports her choice. The key points here are her autonomy, her well-being, and the fact that she's making a decision that affects her own life. \n\nHer mother's disapproval stems from seeing it as disrespecting her grandfather. However, the author's choice to honor her grandfather by keeping the nickname (which is based on her current last name) might actually be a way of respecting him while also having a name that fits her identity. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's exercising her right to self-identify and improve her quality of life. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's autonomy takes precedence here. The answer should be B.\n"
