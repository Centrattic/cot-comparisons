My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe person is a woman who was given a name typically associated with a male, which was named after her grandfather. The name is \"John,\" a short male name without a girly nickname. She's faced teasing in school and is now 21 and engaged. She wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname derived from her current last name, which her friends have used. Her mom disapproves, saying she'd never accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather. The question is whether she's in the wrong for going ahead with the name change despite her mother's disapproval.\n\nFirst, let's consider the person's perspective. She's being true to her identity. Using a name that others use for her in social settings makes sense for her self-identity and comfort. She's an adult, so she has the legal right to change her name. The nickname is something that feels more like her name now. Also, her fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname, which suggests acceptance in her personal life.\n\nOn the other hand, her mother feels hurt because the original name was a tribute to her grandfather. The mother might see the name change as rejecting that legacy. There's emotional weight there. But the mother's feelings are important, but the person's right to choose her own identity is also a significant factor.\n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name is a personal choice, especially when it's about comfort and authenticity. The mother's disapproval is a conflict, but the daughter is an adult, so her autonomy is key. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and identity. The fact that friends and fianc\u00e9 already use the nickname indicates that the new name is already part of her social identity.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the name being given to her by her parents. While the parents had good intentions, the name might not have been suitable for her. Changing it isn't necessarily rejecting the grandfather's memory; she could honor him in other ways. The mother's reaction might be more about losing the name than the grandfather himself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. Her choice is about her own identity and happiness. The mother's disapproval is a conflict, but not grounds for her being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
