My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is a woman who was given a boy's name, \"John,\" by her parents. They named her after her grandfather, which she likes the gesture but the name is a male name without a female equivalent. She's been teased about it in school and now at 21, she wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her last name that she uses in social settings. Her mom is upset because she feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual versus family tradition. The person is an adult now, so she has the legal right to change her name. Her parents chose the name, but they didn't consider a female version. That might have been an oversight on their part. The fact that she's been teased throughout school adds to her distress, which is a significant factor. Name changes are often done for personal identity and comfort, especially when the name causes ongoing issues.\n\nHer mom's reaction is about honoring the grandfather's memory, but the author is trying to live her own life. The nickname she uses is already widely accepted by friends and her fianc\u00e9, which supports her desire to use it officially. Changing the name isn't erasing the grandfather; it's just choosing a name that fits her identity better. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author's autonomy as an adult should take precedence. So, I don't think she's in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
