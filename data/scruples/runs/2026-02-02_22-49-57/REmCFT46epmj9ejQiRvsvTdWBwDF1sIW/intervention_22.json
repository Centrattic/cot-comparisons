My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing their name is wrong because it's a traditionally male name they were given by their parents. The parents named them after the grandfather, but didn't use the female version, which led to a name that's not fitting for the person. The person wants to change both their first and last name to a nickname they've used. The mom is upset and thinks they're disrespecting the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial norms. In some cultures, names are deeply tied to family history, so changing it might be seen as a rejection of that heritage. But in other contexts, personal identity and comfort are prioritized. The person is an adult, 21, so legally they can change their name if they want. The mother's disapproval is significant, but the person's well-being and how they identify is also a factor. They've been teased, which affects their self-esteem. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which shows support. The key points are: personal identity vs. family tradition, the legal right to change a name, and the emotional impact on both the individual and the family. The mother's reaction is about the grandfather's memory, but the person might feel their current name doesn't reflect them. So, whether it's right or wrong depends on balancing these factors. Legally, they aren't in the wrong. Emotionally, they might have valid reasons. The answer leans towards not being in the wrong (B).\n"
