My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used for years. The parents named them after the grandfather, but it's a boy's name, and the person is female. They've been teased for it in school and now they're 21 and want to change their name legally, including the last name. The mom is upset, saying they're forsaking the grandfather's memory, but the person feels the nickname is more their identity now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names if they want, especially if they've used a nickname for a long time. The fact that they're 21 means they can make decisions for themselves without parental consent. The parents might be upset, but that doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. They have a right to their own identity and to choose a name they're comfortable with.\n\nThe parents' argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is choosing a nickname that's already been used by friends and their fianc\u00e9. It seems like they're not rejecting the grandfather's memory entirely, just using a name that fits them better. The teasing and the discomfort at school might have contributed to their desire to change the name, which is a valid reason for seeking personal comfort and social acceptance.\n\nHowever, respecting family feelings is important. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the person has the autonomy to make this choice. The key points here are legal rights, personal identity, and the impact on family relationships. The author isn't necessarily being disrespectful; they're aligning their legal name with how they've always been known, which can boost self-esteem and reduce the stigma they've faced. So, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
