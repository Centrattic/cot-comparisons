My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to legally change their name. The author was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which she's been teased for. She wants to change it to a nickname that's more feminine and what her friends use. Her mom is upset because it's a name after her grandfather and she thinks the author is dishonoring him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the right to name oneself. In many places, adults have the right to change their names for personal reasons. The author is 21, so she's an adult. The parents chose a name, but the child is now choosing to change it. The mother's disapproval is a factor, but the key here is whether the author is wrong for doing this despite that.\n\nThe author mentions being teased at school, which can be a significant issue for someone's well-being. Using a name that feels more authentic can improve self-esteem. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests that she's been using it publicly for a long time. Changing the name to what's already her nickname makes sense for consistency.\n\nThe mother's argument is about honoring her grandfather. But the name was given with that intention, but the author is changing it because it's causing her distress. There's a balance between honoring family legacy and respecting the individual's autonomy. While the mother's feelings are valid, the author's right to self-identify might take precedence here.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She has the right to choose her name, especially for her own comfort and identity. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and authentic self.\n"
