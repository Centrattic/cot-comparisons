My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The original name is a male name given by her parents, named after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and uses a nickname that's more girly. She wants to legally change both her first and last names to that nickname. Her mom is upset, feeling like she's disrespecting her grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she's changing. She's been made fun of, so there's emotional impact. Using a nickname she's comfortable with makes sense. But the parents see it as honoring her grandfather. Is changing the name a rejection of that honor? Or is it about her identity and well-being?\n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name is a personal choice, especially for self-identity and comfort. The parents' disapproval is a valid emotional response, but does that make the author wrong? She's an adult now, so her autonomy is a factor. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests social acceptance. However, the mom's feelings are hurt, which complicates it.\n\nLegally, can she change her name? In most places, yes, as long as it's not for fraudulent reasons. So the question is more about moral/ethical wrongness. If the author feels that using her current name is causing her distress and she's choosing a name that aligns with her identity and social interactions, then it's reasonable. The grandfather's memory is tied to the original name, but the author isn't erasing it entirely\u2014she's using a nickname derived from her last name. Maybe the mother's perspective is about tradition and respect, but the author's perspective is about her own identity and happiness.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life and well-being, which is valid even if her parents disapprove.\n"
