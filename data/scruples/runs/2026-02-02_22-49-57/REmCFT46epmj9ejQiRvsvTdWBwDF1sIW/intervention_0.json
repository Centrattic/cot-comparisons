My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which is a family name (after her grandfather), but she's a girl. The name is short and doesn't have a girly nickname, leading to her being teased at school. Now, at 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname derived from her current last name, which she's used socially. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's disrespecting her grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname already.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given by parents, but it's causing her distress and social issues. She's an adult now, so she has the right to make decisions about her own identity. The fact that her parents didn't use the female version of the name might be a point\u2014maybe they should have considered that. But she's changing both her first and last names, which goes beyond just a nickname. The mother's disapproval is strong, but the author is choosing to do it anyway. \n\nI think the main factors here are autonomy and well-being. Adults can make decisions about their names, especially if it affects their mental health and social interactions. The mother's perspective is about family tradition and honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's perspective is about her identity and comfort. Since the name was given without considering the gender aspect (as the grandfather is male), the parents might share some responsibility. Also, the nickname is already widely used, so changing the legal name to that might make sense for consistency. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname supports that it's a name she's associated with.\n\nThe mother's reaction is hurtful, but as an adult, the author has the right to choose her name. So, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong. The key here is personal identity versus family tradition, and in such cases, personal well-being often takes precedence once someone is an adult.\n"
