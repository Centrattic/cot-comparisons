My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name given by her parents, which was after her grandfather, to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom is upset about it, thinking she's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the user is 21 and engaged, so an adult. She's been using the nickname socially for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The parents named her after the grandfather, but didn't adjust it for a female version. The name is a short male name without a girly nickname, leading to teasing. She wants to change both first and last names to the nickname, but her mom disapproves.\n\nI need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy as an adult, the impact of the name on her well-being, and cultural or family traditions. Since she's an adult, she has the legal right to change her name. The name change is about her identity and comfort, especially since she's used the nickname publicly and it's important for her happiness. Her mother's disapproval is a family conflict, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing her own needs. The grandfather's memory might be a point her mom brings up, but the author isn't disrespecting him by choosing a different name; she's just finding a name that fits her better. So, likely the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
