My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that the person was given a male name by their parents, named after their grandfather. The name is \"John,\" a short male name with no girly nickname. They've been teased at school, and now at 21, they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name that friends use. Their mom disapproves, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking the grandfather's memory. The person is considering going ahead anyway.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants to know my opinion. The answer should be A or B, corresponding to yes or no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and rights involved. The person is an adult, 21 years old. In many jurisdictions, adults have the legal right to change their names. So the legal aspect isn't an issue. The parents named them after the grandfather, which was a gesture, but the person feels the name doesn't fit their gender identity or social interactions. The name has caused them teasing, which is a significant emotional impact. Using a nickname that friends already use suggests that the community around them accepts this identity.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather. However, the person's well-being and sense of self-identity are also important. The mother's feelings are valid, but they can't override the adult child's autonomy. The person isn't erasing the grandfather's memory unless they're changing the name to something completely different. If the new name is a nickname derived from their current last name, maybe the grandfather's name isn't entirely erased. The person's happiness and comfort in their own identity is a strong point in their favor.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which indicates social acceptance and support. The person has been using the nickname socially, so changing the legal name would align their identity across all aspects. This could help reduce the teasing they've experienced and affirm their true self.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the family's tradition and honoring ancestors are important. But respect for family traditions doesn't override an individual's right to self-identify. The key here is the balance between respecting family history and personal identity. The person isn't necessarily dishonoring the grandfather; they are choosing a name that fits their identity better. The mother's disapproval might stem from feeling that the grandfather's name is being discarded, but if the new name still has a connection through the nickname, maybe that's not the case.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the common thread is whether the person acted unethically. Since the person is making a choice that affects their own life and is not directly harming others (unless the mother's feelings are considered harm, which is emotional but not physical or legal), the person isn't in the wrong. The mother's feelings are hurt, but the person's autonomy is a stronger ethical consideration here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
