My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a girl given a male name (like John) by her parents, named after her grandfather. They didn't use a female version. The name's been a source of teasing at school. Now she's 21, engaged, and wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is upset, thinking she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author wants to do it anyway because the nickname feels more like her real name now, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name too.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks she's not, so they want to confirm.\n\nLet me consider the factors. Name changes are personal choices. The author has a valid reason: the original name caused her distress and teasing. She's an adult, so she has the right to choose her name. Her parents' disapproval is their issue, but it doesn't make her wrong. The nickname has been her social name, so it's about her identity. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname supports her choice. The mom's argument about honoring her grandfather is a sentiment, but the author isn't erasing the name entirely\u2014she's just changing her name. The grandfather's name is still part of her history through her current last name. Legally and socially, changing one's name is allowed unless there are legal restrictions. There's no indication of any illegality here.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The mom feels hurt, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her parents' feelings over her own well-being. The name change is about her identity and comfort. The author's reasons are valid. So, the answer should be B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
