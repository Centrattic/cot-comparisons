My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname, chosen because they've been using it for a long time and their parents gave them a name after their grandpa that doesn't have a female equivalent. The parents are upset because they think she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and she's been using it in social settings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, changing your name after marriage is common, especially for women. But here, she's also changing her first name, which complicates things. The parents named her after their son's name (the grandfather's name), which is a male name. The person feels the name doesn't fit her gender identity or presentation, leading to teasing. She's been using a nickname that's more female-presenting for years. The parents disapprove, saying she's disrespecting her grandfather.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the name was given with a specific intention, but she's an adult now. Adults have the legal right to change their names. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but does that make her wrong? She's prioritizing her own comfort and identity, which is important. However, there's a cultural expectation to honor family names. But if the name was never a good fit, and it's causing her distress, maybe she's justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's support is a factor too. They use the nickname, which shows acceptance. The key points are autonomy, cultural expectations, family relationships, and personal well-being. While the parents feel hurt, the person has the right to choose her identity. So probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
