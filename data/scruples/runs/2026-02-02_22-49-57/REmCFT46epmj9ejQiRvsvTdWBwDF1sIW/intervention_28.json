My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a boy's name, like \"John\" without a feminine variation. She's been teased for it in school and now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which her friends use. Her mom is against it, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author is considering going ahead despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are autonomy over one's name, respect for family legacy, and the impact of the name change on relationships.\n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects someone's self-esteem and social interactions. The author mentions being teased and that the nickname feels more like her identity. Legally, in many places, adults can change their names without needing permission from family, so there's a legal right aspect here. However, the emotional aspect with her mother is significant. The mother feels the name change dishonors her grandfather, which adds a layer of family history and sentiment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's well-being and comfort in her own skin are important. If the current name has caused her distress and the new name aligns with her identity, that's a strong argument in her favor. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the new name and her friends have always used the nickname suggests that this change is for her authentic self-presentation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting her mother's feelings. The mother's objection is rooted in honoring her grandfather. However, the author was named after him, but the name isn't a female version, which might have been a different gesture. The grandfather's memory is tied to the name, but does changing the name necessarily forsake that memory? Maybe the mother's perspective is that by changing it, the author is not maintaining the family tradition, but the author is choosing to honor herself and her identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think it's more about personal choice versus family expectations. Since the author is an adult, her autonomy is her own to decide. The mother's feelings are valid, but they don't override the author's right to self-identify. The answer likely is that she's not in the wrong because she's making a decision that affects her own life and well-being, even if it causes strain in family relationships. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, but the final decision rests with the author.\n"
