My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a girl wants to change her name from a male name, \"John,\" which her parents gave her after her grandfather. The parents didn't provide a female version, and she's been teased at school. Now she's 21, engaged, and wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she can't accept the new name and feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman is an adult (21) and has the legal right to change her name. The name was given as a boy's name by her parents, which led to teasing. Changing her name to something she identifies with more is about her identity and comfort. The nickname has been used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, indicating that it's meaningful to her. Her mother's disapproval is based on sentimental reasons, but legally and ethically, the woman should have the autonomy to choose her name. The grandfather's memory is being honored through the original name, but she's not erasing that; she's creating her own identity. The mother's refusal to accept the new name is more about her feelings rather than the daughter's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
