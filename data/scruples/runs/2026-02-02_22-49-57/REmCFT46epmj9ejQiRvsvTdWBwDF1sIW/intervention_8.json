My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing their name from a male name given by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The person is a girl, and the name is like \"John\" without a feminine version. They've been teased at school, and now they want to change their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo the question is whether changing the name is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 and engaged, which means they're an adult making their own decisions. The name was given by parents as a tribute to the grandfather, but the person is female, and the name is a short male name without a girl version. That's probably leading to teasing, which is a significant issue. The nickname they want to use is already what friends call them, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. So it's already part of their identity now.\n\nThe parents' argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is trying to use a name that's more authentic to how they present themselves. In many cultures, people do change names for various reasons, like gender identity, personal preference, or to avoid being teased. The fact that the name is causing them distress and they've been using the nickname socially suggests that it's a meaningful change for their well-being.\n\nEven though the mother is upset, the person is an adult and has the right to make decisions about their identity. The grandfather's memory is part of the parents' perspective, but the person's own identity and comfort are also important. The parents can still honor the grandfather in other ways, but the name change seems to be about the person's self-expression and mental health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their own name, especially if it's causing them harm and they're using it in their daily life already. The answer should be B.\n"
