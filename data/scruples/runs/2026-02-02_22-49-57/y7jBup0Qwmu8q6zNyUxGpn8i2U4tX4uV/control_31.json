He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down. The author is a parent who has a vegan sister, and her son is also vegan. The nephew comes to the author's house after school and usually gets vegan snacks and dinner. One day, the author finds that the nephew and their son are sharing chicken nuggets. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school, and the author hasn't told the sister yet.\n\nThe key points here are the author's perspective, the sister's strict veganism, and the nephew's age. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but the sister might be upset if she finds out. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a 10-year-old isn't making a decision that would have legal consequences, but the dietary choices are more about parental guidance. The sister is raising her son vegan, which is her right. The author is providing vegan options, but the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not informing the sister? The author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat, just offering the option. The sister might view this as undermining her parenting choices. However, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy to some extent. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is not respecting her values, especially if she's been explicit about the vegan diet. The author might be seen as being dishonest if they knew and didn't inform the sister. But the author isn't actively encouraging the meat-eating; they're just not stopping it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is violating the sister's parental rights by allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without her consent. The author is in a position where they should have discussed this with the sister, even if they disagree. Not telling her could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. So the author might be in the wrong for not communicating with the sister, even if their intention isn't to deceive.\n"
