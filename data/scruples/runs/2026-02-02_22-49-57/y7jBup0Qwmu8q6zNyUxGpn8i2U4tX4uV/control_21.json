He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though they usually provide vegan options and don't mention it when he chooses the non-vegan option.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan, which is a personal choice and she's strict about it. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's in the age where he's starting to make his own decisions, but he's still a child. The author is providing both vegan and non-vegan meals, which gives the nephew a choice. The nephew sometimes eats the meat, possibly influenced by his friends at school. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband is concerned about this secrecy.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. parental authority. The sister has the right to raise her child according to her beliefs, and the author is allowing the nephew to make choices. However, the sister might not be okay with the child eating meat, even if he's choosing it. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew but is not informing the parent, which could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the nephew is old enough to express his preferences, and the author is respecting his choice by not confronting him. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the sister's rules are that the nephew must not eat meat, then the author's actions might conflict with that. But the author is trying to balance respecting the nephew's autonomy with their sister's wishes. The husband's perspective is that they're being dishonest, which is a valid point. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. But the author isn't lying; they're just not informing the sister about the nephew's choices, which could be considered a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't breaking any laws or clear moral boundaries. They're allowing the child to explore different food choices, which some might see as supporting the child's autonomy. However, the parent's authority in dietary decisions is also important. Since the sister is the parent and has specific ethical beliefs, the author's decision not to inform her might be seen as undermining her parenting, which could make the author in the wrong. But others might argue that the nephew is making his own choices and the author is being accommodating.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether respecting the parent's wishes is prioritized over the child's autonomy. The question is whether the author's actions violate the sister's trust and the agreed-upon parenting approach. If the sister expected the nephew to strictly follow veganism at all times, then the author is in the wrong. But if there's an understanding that the nephew can have more flexibility when with the aunt, then maybe not. Since the author hasn't discussed this with the sister, it's a communication issue more than a direct wrongdoing. So, the answer could be A (wrong) because the author is not being transparent with the parent, which could lead to conflict and betrayal of trust.\n"
