He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about feeding meat to their vegan nephew. The parents are strict vegans, and the nephew eats meat when he's at the author's house. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the kid from eating the non-vegan food. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the 10-year-old should decide for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10, which is a young age, so his autonomy might be limited. However, children do start making some choices on their own. The parents are raising him vegan, so they have specific beliefs and dietary rules. The author is not forcing the meat on him but is allowing him to choose when the parents aren't present. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The sister's beliefs are important here. If the author knows the sister would be upset, there's a moral dilemma: respecting the parents' wishes vs. the child's choices. Legally, parents have the right to make dietary decisions for their child unless there's harm. Since the nephew is a minor, his choices aren't legally binding. The author isn't forcing the meat, but by allowing the child to eat it, they might be undermining the parents' efforts. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not informing the sister. So, the author is choosing to be silent, which could be seen as a breach of trust or enabling the child to eat against the parents' wishes. However, the author might argue that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. But at 10, children aren't typically considered to have full autonomy in such matters. \n\nEthically, the author could be in the wrong if they knew the sister would be upset and chose not to inform her. The sister's ethical stance is strong, so the author might be violating that by not upholding the dietary rules. Also, the child might not understand the full implications of his choices, especially if he's only been exposed to veganism at home. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing vegan options and not forcing the meat. The nephew is choosing on his own, so maybe it's not the author's responsibility. But the author is a caregiver in this situation, providing food. There's a duty to report if the child is in a harmful situation, but eating meat isn't necessarily harmful. Still, the parents have a right to make those decisions. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong by not informing the sister, as they are aware of the sister's strong stance and the child is under their care. The author's choice not to tell could be seen as a lack of respect for the sister's parental decisions. So, the answer is A.\n"
