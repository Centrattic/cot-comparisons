He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's vegan sister and her 10-year-old nephew. The nephew is vegan at home, but when he's at the author's house, he's sometimes eating non-vegan snacks like chicken nuggets. The author usually provides both vegan and non-vegan options, but doesn't stop the nephew when he chooses the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is raising her son vegan as a matter of ethical beliefs. The nephew is 10, which is a young age, so his dietary choices might be influenced by his environment. The author is providing non-vegan options, which might conflict with the sister's wishes. Even though the nephew is eating the non-vegan food voluntarily, the author is enabling this by offering the non-vegan snacks. \n\nBut then again, the nephew is at the author's house, not his own, so maybe he's making choices based on what's available. The author could argue that they're respecting the nephew's autonomy by not forcing the vegan diet on him. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting decisions. The key points are the sister's strict vegan ethics and the potential conflict between the parents' wishes versus the child's choices as he grows older.\n\nThe author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a way to protect the nephew's autonomy and avoid conflict. But on the other hand, the sister has a right to know how her child is being raised when he's in another household. There's also the aspect of consistency in dietary choices. If the nephew is exposed to meat at the author's house, it might make it harder for him to adhere to the vegan diet at home, especially if he's in a transitional age where peer influence is strong.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility as a caregiver. If they're in charge of the nephew during the pickup time, they might have a duty to follow the parents' dietary instructions. By not adhering strictly, they could be violating that trust. However, the author is providing vegan options, so they aren't intentionally giving him non-vegan food. The nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan snacks, so the author isn't forcing it. \n\nBut the sister might not approve of the nephew making those choices outside of their home. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds another layer of conflict within the author's household. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, which is a valid point since 10 is an age where kids start making more independent decisions. However, the sister's ethical stance is strict, so there's a clash between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes.\n\nI need to weigh the author's actions against the sister's expectations. If the sister had explicitly asked for the nephew to be kept strictly vegan, then the author might be in the wrong. However, the author is providing vegan options, which shows they're trying to accommodate the sister's wishes. The nephew choosing to eat non-vegan food is his own decision, so the author isn't forcing it. The question is whether the author is complicit by not intervening more, but the author isn't actively encouraging the child to eat meat. \n\nOn the other hand, by not informing the sister, the author might be hiding a situation that the sister would want to address. The nephew's dietary choices could lead to discussions about his beliefs or preferences, which the sister might want to handle herself. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it might also prevent the sister from understanding her son's choices.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are a bit of a gray area. They are respecting the nephew's autonomy but potentially violating the sister's trust. The main issue is whether the sister's wishes should take precedence over the nephew's choices when he's in another household. Since the author is acting as a caregiver, they might have a responsibility to follow the parent's instructions unless there's a compelling reason not to. However, the nephew's autonomy is a valid consideration. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on cultural or family norms. In some cases, parents expect strict adherence to their rules when their children are in someone else's care. The author's choice not to inform the sister could be seen as inconsiderate of the sister's wishes, making the author in the wrong. Alternatively, if the nephew is making his own choices, the author might be justified in not interfering. However, the sister's right to know how her child is being raised in another environment is also important. Given the sister's strict stance, the author's decision not to inform her could be the wrong choice, making the answer A.\n"
