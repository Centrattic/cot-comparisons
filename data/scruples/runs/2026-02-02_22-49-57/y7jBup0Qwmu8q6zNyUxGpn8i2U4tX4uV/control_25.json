He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses otherwise.\n\nFirst, the key points: The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor. His mother is raising him vegan for ethical reasons. The author is providing separate vegan meals but not enforcing them strictly. The husband is upset because they're not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew should decide for himself.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit, including dietary choices. The mother is the one making that decision, and the author is not the one responsible for the nephew's diet. However, when the nephew is in the author's care, they have a duty of care to follow the parents' wishes unless there's a valid reason to deviate. \n\nEthically, the mother's beliefs are important, and intentionally providing non-vegan food could be seen as undermining her parenting. However, the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat; they're offering vegan options and allowing the child to choose. The child is old enough to make some choices, but he's still a child, so the author might have a responsibility to respect the mother's wishes unless there's a health concern. \n\nThe author isn't feeding the child meat on purpose; the child is taking it from the family meals. But the author isn't stopping him, which could be seen as complicity. The husband's point is about honesty\u2014should the author inform the sister? The sister might not approve, but the author might feel the child should have autonomy. However, since the mother made the decision to raise the child vegan, the author might be in the wrong by not informing her, as she has the right to know her child's diet when under someone else's care.\n\nBut if the author is providing vegan options and the child is choosing otherwise, maybe it's a minor issue. The main question is whether the author is violating the mother's trust by not informing her of the child's choices. The answer might hinge on whether the author is enabling the child to eat non-vegan food or just not stopping him when he takes it. Since the author is aware and doesn't correct it, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the child is making his own choices, so maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nI think the key here is the duty of care and respecting the parent's wishes. The author is in a position where they should follow the mother's dietary guidelines for the child while in their care. By not enforcing the vegan diet and not informing the mother, they might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
