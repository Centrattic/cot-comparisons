He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan since birth. The writer, who has their nephew over regularly, provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan food, even though the writer knows the sister would be upset. The husband thinks the writer is dishonest for not telling the sister, but the writer believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting the parents' wishes versus the nephew's autonomy. The sister is very strict about the vegan diet for ethical reasons, which the writer respects. But the nephew is 10 now, which is a common age where kids start wanting more independence, including in food choices. The writer isn't forcing the meat on him; they're offering options. The nephew is making his own choices, which the writer allows without intervention. \n\nI need to consider if the writer is violating any trust or agreement with the sister. The sister might have expected the nephew to strictly adhere to veganism when at the writer's house. However, the writer isn't trying to deceive; they're just allowing the child to choose. The writer is also providing vegan options as per the sister's request, so they're fulfilling part of the arrangement. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between the parent's beliefs and the child's autonomy. The writer might not be in the wrong because they're respecting the nephew's choices, especially since he's old enough to understand the difference and make decisions. However, the sister might feel betrayed if she found out, even if the writer didn't force the meat. But the writer isn't hiding the fact entirely; they had a conversation with the nephew when he first ate the meat. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's point is about honesty. The sister has the right to know what's happening, especially if it's against her parenting choices. But the writer is trying to balance that with the nephew's autonomy. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms around child-rearing. \n\nIn many cases, parents have specific dietary rules for their children, and others are expected to follow those unless there's a valid reason not to. However, the writer isn't violating any laws or strict rules beyond the family's expectations. Since the nephew is making his own choices, the writer isn't forcing him, so it's more about the nephew's agency. \n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong because they're allowing the child to make choices, even if it goes against the parent's wishes. The sister might not be happy, but the writer isn't forcing the meat and is respecting the nephew's autonomy. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
