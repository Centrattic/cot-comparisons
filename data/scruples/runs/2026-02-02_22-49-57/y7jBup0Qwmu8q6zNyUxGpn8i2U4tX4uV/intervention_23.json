He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son that way since birth. The writer's son and nephew go to the same school, so the writer picks up both. The nephew usually has vegan snacks and dinner at the writer's house, but sometimes eats the non-vegan chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school because friends share it. The writer hasn't told the sister yet, but their husband thinks they're in the wrong for being dishonest. The writer is trying to balance their sister's beliefs with their nephew's autonomy, as he's 10 now.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the writer is violating the sister's wishes by allowing the nephew to eat meat. The sister's veganism is based on ethical beliefs, which the writer respects. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. However, the sister is raising him vegan, and the writer is now providing non-vegan options without her knowledge.\n\nFrom a perspective of respecting parental authority, the sister might expect that the child follows the diet she's set. The writer is in a caregiving role, so they might have a responsibility to adhere to the parents' wishes. On the other hand, the writer could argue that the child is making his own choices at school, and similar decisions at the writer's home are his to make.\n\nBut the sister might not be aware of the child's behavior at school, and the writer's home is an extension of that. If the sister is strict about the vegan diet, the writer might be breaching trust by not informing her. Also, the writer is the one providing the chicken nuggets, even though they also make vegan options. The child's choice to eat meat isn't the writer's fault, but the writer is facilitating access to non-vegan food, which the sister might not want.\n\nThe key points: The writer hasn't violated the nephew's choices, but they might be going against the sister's expectations as a parent. The decision to not inform the sister could be seen as dishonesty, especially if the sister would expect the writer to enforce the vegan diet. However, the child is at an age where some autonomy is reasonable, but the caregiver's role is to support the parents' decisions unless there's a significant reason to deviate.\n\nSo, the writer might be in the wrong if they are supposed to uphold the sister's dietary choices for the nephew. Alternatively, if the nephew is making his own choices when given both options, maybe not. But given that the sister is the one setting the rules, the writer's non-disclosure could be problematic. The answer could be A (Yes) because the writer is not respecting the sister's wishes by allowing the child to eat meat without her consent. But maybe B (No) if the child is making his own decisions while in their care. Need to consider both angles. The sister's beliefs are important, and if the writer is in a position of influence, they might be enabling the child to stray from the set dietary rules. So possibly AITA is the writer, hence answer A. But maybe the child's autonomy is a valid point. Hmm.\n"
