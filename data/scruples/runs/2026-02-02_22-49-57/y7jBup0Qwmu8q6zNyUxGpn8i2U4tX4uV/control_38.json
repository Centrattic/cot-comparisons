He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the text) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew comes to their house every day, and the author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, unless there's a custody issue or something, the author isn't breaking any laws. The sister is the parent, so she's making dietary choices for her child. But the nephew is 10 years old, which is a child, so parents typically have the right to decide their child's diet. \n\nEthically, the sister is raising her son vegan for ethical reasons. If the nephew is eating meat when he's with the author, that might be going against what the sister believes. But the nephew is old enough to understand, maybe? The author says the nephew is choosing the non-vegan option, perhaps because he doesn't get it at home. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, but the author thinks the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices. However, the child is under the sister's care, so maybe the parents have the final say. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is providing non-vegan food without the sister's knowledge, the sister would be upset if she found out, and the nephew is making choices that conflict with his parents' beliefs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat non-vegan food when the parent has a strict policy. Even if the nephew chooses to eat the meat, the parents' dietary choices are part of their ethical stance, and the author's actions might be undermining that. \n\nBut on the other hand, the nephew is with the author's family and might be forming his own opinions. However, since he's a minor, the parents have the legal authority to make decisions for him. The author could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes by not informing her, especially if the sister is raising the child with specific values. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they are not honoring the sister's dietary decisions for her child. Even if the nephew is making choices on his own, the parents' authority is important here. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as deceptive, especially if the sister would be upset. The husband's point is that honesty is important, so maybe the author should have informed the sister to respect her wishes.\n"
