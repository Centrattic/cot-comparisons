He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who is vegan and raises her son vegan. The author, the sister, sometimes feeds the vegan nephew non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, when he chooses them. The nephew is 10 years old. The sister's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The sister is strict about her veganism and would be upset if she knew. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing the nephew to eat them. The nephew is making his own choices, maybe influenced by his friends at school.\n\nIs the author overstepping by allowing the nephew to eat meat? The nephew is a minor, so his parents have the right to decide his diet. But the author is the one providing the food. However, the nephew is making the choice himself, which complicates things. The author isn't forcing him; it's the nephew's choice. So maybe the author isn't wrong for not informing the sister, because the nephew is exercising autonomy. On the other hand, the sister might feel that the uncle is undermining her parenting by not controlling what the nephew eats during visits.\n\nBut the nephew is old enough to make decisions. At 10, children can make some choices, especially about food. The author is respecting the nephew's choice, which could be seen as allowing him to explore his preferences. The sister might not have considered that the nephew wants some variety. The author's actions might be in the nephew's best interest if he's curious about non-vegan food. However, the sister's beliefs are important, and the author is technically not following her rules. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister had set clear rules that the nephew must stay vegan even at the author's house, then the author would be in the wrong. But there's no indication that the sister communicated that. The author is providing vegan options, so the nephew's choice isn't forced. The author isn't encouraging the nephew to eat meat; it's the nephew making the choice. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nThe husband's opinion is that the author is in the wrong for being dishonest. But the author might not see it as dishonest if they are allowing the nephew to choose. The sister might not appreciate it, but the author's intention is to respect the nephew's autonomy. So the author's actions are morally neutral or even in the nephew's interest. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
