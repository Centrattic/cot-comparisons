He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who feeds their vegan nephew meat is in the wrong. The scenario is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him from choosing the meat, like chicken nuggets. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong (ITA) for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't, but wants my opinion. They want a yes (A) or no (B) answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old. His mother is a staunch vegan, and he's been vegan since birth. The author is providing vegan options but not enforcing it strictly. The nephew is choosing meat sometimes, possibly because he's curious or wants to fit in with friends. The author isn't preventing him from eating the non-vegan food but also isn't telling the mother.\n\nLegally, the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat. The child is making his own choices, within reason for a 10-year-old. Parents have the right to raise their children a certain way, but when the child is in someone else's care, there might be some responsibility to inform the parent if the child's dietary choices are going against what the parent wants. However, this depends on the child's age and capacity to make decisions. A 10-year-old might not be considered fully autonomous in dietary choices, especially if it's against the parent's wishes.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict. The parent's beliefs are being disregarded. The author is allowing the child to choose, but that choice contradicts the parent's upbringing. However, the author could argue that the child is old enough to explore and that the parent's strictness might be causing the child to rebel. Also, the author is providing vegan options, which shows they respect the parent's wishes, but are allowing some flexibility.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the parent's potential reaction. The sister is very strict, and the author is avoiding conflict by not informing her. The husband thinks this is dishonest. But maybe the author is trying to protect the child from being scolded or punished for exploring his own preferences.\n\nIn family dynamics, it's about respecting boundaries. The parent has entrusted the child to the author's care, but with specific dietary instructions. The author is not fulfilling that trust by allowing the child to eat meat. However, the child is making his own choices, and the author might be trying to let him have some freedom.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parent specifically asked for the child to be kept vegan, then the author is technically violating that request. But the child is choosing to eat meat, which might indicate that he's not being forced. The parent's wishes are about the child's overall upbringing, but the author's role is as a temporary caregiver. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the parent's wishes. Alternatively, if the child is making the choice independently, maybe the author isn't responsible for enforcing the vegan diet beyond providing the options.\n\nAnother angle: the author is providing vegan food, which is respectful, but not ensuring that the child only eats that. The parent might expect the child to stick to vegan food when in the author's care. If the child is allowed to choose, the author might be considered complicit in the child's non-adherence to the vegan diet. But the author isn't forcing it, just not stopping the child.\n\nIn some cases, parents might want to be informed if their child is making choices that contradict their upbringing, especially in ethical matters like veganism. The author is withholding that information, which the husband considers dishonest. However, the author might see it as protecting the child's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all that, there's a balance between the parent's wishes, the child's autonomy, and the caregiver's role. Since the parent is raising the child vegan, the caregiver has a responsibility to uphold that unless the child is old enough to make their own decisions. At 10, it's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong for not honoring the parent's request to keep the child vegan, even if the child is choosing otherwise. The author could have a conversation with the parent to explain the situation and let the parent decide how to handle it, rather than making the decision themselves to stay silent.\n"
