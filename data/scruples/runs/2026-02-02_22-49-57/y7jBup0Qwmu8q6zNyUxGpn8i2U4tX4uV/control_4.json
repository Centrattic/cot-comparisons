He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan snacks. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses meat. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, children are starting to make their own choices, but they also rely on adults to know what's best for them, especially regarding health. The mother's decision to raise her son vegan is based on ethical reasons, so she might be concerned about his diet for those reasons. The author is respecting their sister's beliefs by providing vegan options but not enforcing them strictly. \n\nIs there a conflict here? The main issue is whether the author is overstepping by allowing the nephew to eat meat, even if he's choosing it himself. The author argues that the child is old enough to make his own dietary choices. But the child is under the care of the author when at their house, so there's a responsibility to follow the parent's wishes unless there's a health issue. However, if the child is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't forcing him to eat meat but is allowing it. \n\nAnother angle: The sister might not be aware that her child is eating meat in the author's care. The author's husband thinks they should inform the sister, but the author is choosing not to. This could be seen as a breach of trust if the sister discovered that her child was being given meat without her knowledge. However, the author is providing vegan options, so it's not like they're actively promoting meat. It's more about allowing the child to choose when he's not under his mother's supervision. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the sister explicitly told the author that the nephew should never eat meat, then the author would be in the wrong for not following that instruction. But if the sister didn't specify that, and the author is just allowing the child to make his own choices when he's in their care, it's a bit more nuanced. The author might be respecting the child's autonomy, which is a valid point. However, as a guardian, the sister might expect that the child's dietary restrictions are strictly followed when in someone else's care. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's health. A vegan diet can be healthy, but the child's choice to eat meat might be influenced by peer pressure or curiosity. The author might be trying to be lenient, but the sister's ethical stance is important to her. If the author is not enforcing the vegan diet, is that respecting the child's choices or undermining the parent's authority?\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes. Since the sister is strict about veganism, the author might be in the wrong by not informing her, as it's a matter of the parent's values and the child's upbringing. The author's decision to not tell the sister could be seen as withholding information that the parent would consider important. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
