He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old and has been raised vegan. The author provides vegan snacks but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author didn't tell the sister about this, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for being dishonest.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental rights vs. the child's autonomy and the ethical implications. The sister is very strict about being vegan for ethical reasons. The author is making a choice to not inform the mother, allowing the nephew to choose the non-vegan food when given the option. \n\nI need to consider if the author is violating the mother's wishes by not informing her. Since the mother is raising the child vegan, she probably expects that the child isn't exposed to meat outside the home. The author's decision to not tell could be seen as keeping a secret, which might be dishonest. On the other hand, the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nBut at 10 years old, is the child really capable of making informed dietary decisions, especially when it's against the parent's values? The mother might feel it's important for the child to stick to the vegan diet for ethical reasons. The author is allowing the child to deviate from that without the parent's knowledge. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of trust. If the mother finds out, she might feel betrayed that her sister didn't inform her. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling. It's a matter of whether the author has the right to make that decision without consulting the parent. \n\nThe ethical beliefs here are strong on both sides. The author is respecting the nephew's choice, but the mother's beliefs are about ethical eating. The author might be prioritizing the child's autonomy, but the mother might see it as undermining her parenting. \n\nI think the key issue is the lack of communication. The author didn't discuss this with the sister, and maybe should have. Even if the author thinks the nephew can choose, the parent has the right to know what's happening. So, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister. That would be answer A.\n"
