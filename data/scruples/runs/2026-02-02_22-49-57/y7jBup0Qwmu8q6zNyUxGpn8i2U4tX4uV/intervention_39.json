He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is a vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew eats non-vegan food at the author's house, even though vegan options are provided. The author hasn't told the sister about this, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for being dishonest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old. The sister is strict about veganism, and the author is trying to respect that by providing vegan meals. But the nephew is choosing the non-vegan options, perhaps because he's used to it at home. The author is conflicted between respecting the sister's beliefs and allowing the child some autonomy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are providing vegan options as per the sister's request, which shows respect. The nephew is making his own choices, which might be part of his development. However, the sister's values are important here. The author's husband thinks they're dishonest by not informing the sister. But the author might be trying to protect the nephew's autonomy and avoid conflict.\n\nLegally, the child's parents are responsible for their diet, but the author isn't the legal guardian. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; it's his choice. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't violating any laws. The key here is whether the author is respecting the sister's wishes or the nephew's autonomy. Since the author is providing vegan options and the nephew chooses otherwise, maybe it's a balance between respecting both parties. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're providing vegan meals as requested, and the child's choice to eat non-vegan food isn't their fault. However, if the sister were to find out, there could be conflict, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for the nephew's choices.\n"
