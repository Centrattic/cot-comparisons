He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising the nephew as vegan since birth, and the author, who has a son in the same school, picks up both boys. The nephew gets vegan meals, but sometimes eats the non-vegan options when given the chance, like chicken nuggets. The author knows the sister would be upset if she found out, but they haven't told her yet. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' rights. The sister is raising her child vegan, which is a personal choice based on ethical beliefs. As a parent, she has the right to decide her child's diet unless there's a health concern. The author's decision to allow the nephew to eat non-vegan food might interfere with that parental authority. \n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. The author is not informing the sister about the nephew's meat consumption. Even if the nephew is old enough to make choices, the parents are the ones who set the dietary rules. By not telling, the author could be seen as being deceptive. However, the nephew is 10, which is an age where children start to have more autonomy, but it's still within the parents' control.\n\nEthically, the sister's stance is about ethics, so the author's actions might be conflicting with those values. The author might not agree with veganism but is respecting the sister's choice. However, allowing the nephew to eat meat when it's against the parents' wishes could be seen as undermining their parenting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't forcing him. But the author is providing non-vegan options in their home, which might contradict the parents' efforts at home. The line is blurry here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they are respecting the nephew's autonomy. However, the parent's authority is a significant factor. The sister's reaction could be severe if she finds out, and the author's husband's concern about honesty is valid. So, while the author isn't forcing the nephew, they are not upholding the parents' dietary rules, which could be considered a breach of trust or respect towards the sister.\n"
