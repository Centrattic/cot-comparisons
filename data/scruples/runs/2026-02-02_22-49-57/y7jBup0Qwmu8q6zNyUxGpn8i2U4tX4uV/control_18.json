He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The scenario is that the sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son vegan. The nephew has been vegan since birth. The author provides vegan snacks and meals but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The author found out he eats meat at school too. Now, the author isn't telling the sister, and the husband says they're being dishonest. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are strong, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is a bit old to start making his own choices, but maybe not fully independent yet. The author is respecting their sister's wishes by providing vegan options but isn't stopping the nephew from eating the meat if he chooses. Is that okay?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the nephew might be curious or trying to fit in with friends. The sister's strict veganism could mean she's against any animal products. The author isn't forcing the meat on him but isn't stopping him either. Is the author violating the sister's trust by not informing her? Or is it the nephew's right to choose, even if it goes against his parents' beliefs?\n\nLegally, the parents have the right to raise their child vegan, but the child might have some autonomy in making choices as he gets older. However, in most places, parents have authority over their children's diet until they're 18. The nephew's diet is a parental decision. So allowing him to eat meat could be against the parents' wishes, but the author isn't the one raising the child. They are a relative, not the legal guardians.\n\nThe author provided vegan options, so they are respecting the sister's request. The nephew's choices are his own, but since he's a minor, maybe the author should have informed the mother, especially if the child is eating non-vegan food. The husband's argument is that they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, which could be a point against the author.\n\nBut the author might think the nephew is old enough to decide, and that the sister would overreact. However, the sister's beliefs are strong, and the author is keeping this to protect both the nephew and the sister. It's a conflict between respecting the sister's wishes and the nephew's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is in a tricky spot. They're not forcing the meat, but they aren't stopping the nephew from eating it. They might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the sister's expressed wishes, even if they're trying to be respectful. Alternatively, the nephew's growing autonomy could justify it.\n\nBut since the author is a caregiver in this scenario, providing food for the nephew, they have a responsibility to follow the parents' dietary instructions unless there's a safety issue. Allowing the child to eat non-vegan food might breach that trust. So the author's silence could be seen as dishonesty, making them at fault. However, if the child is choosing on his own, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the fact that they provide both options and let the child choose without informing the parent might mean they're partially at fault for not adhering strictly to the sister's wishes.\n"
