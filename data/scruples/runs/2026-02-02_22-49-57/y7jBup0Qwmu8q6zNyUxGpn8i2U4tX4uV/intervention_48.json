He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan snacks provided. The author doesn't tell the sister about this, and the husband thinks they're at fault for not being honest. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister about the nephew eating meat. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew when he chooses the meat. The sister is strict about veganism, so if she found out, she might be upset.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's position is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. At 10, he's a child, so his autonomy is limited. However, parents typically make dietary choices for their children, especially when it comes to ethical beliefs like veganism. The sister is raising her son vegan, so she's making that choice on his behalf. If the nephew is eating meat at the author's house, the sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the nephew is exposed to different options and that it's part of his development to explore different foods. However, the sister's strict adherence to veganism suggests that she might view this as a betrayal of her values. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as keeping the nephew's actions secret, which might be considered dishonest.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is at fault for not telling the sister. This could be because transparency in such matters is important, especially when it involves the child's diet and the parent's beliefs. The author might feel that they are respecting the nephew's choices, but the sister's perspective is about maintaining her own ethical standards for her child.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the nephew. If he's getting meat at school from friends, maybe he's already encountering it there. The author's approach could be seen as allowing him to explore without pressure, but the sister might see it as conflicting with her values. It's a balancing act between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical frameworks, there's no legal wrong here since it's about dietary choices. Ethically, it's more about conflicting values. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe they're giving the child options, but the sister might feel her parenting is being compromised.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered a breach of trust or a support of the sister's parenting. If the sister is unaware and the author is not truthful about the situation, that could be seen as inconsiderate, hence the author being at fault. However, if the author is respecting the child's autonomy and providing options, they might not be in the wrong. But given the sister's strict stance, the author might be in the wrong for not upholding the parent's wishes.\n"
