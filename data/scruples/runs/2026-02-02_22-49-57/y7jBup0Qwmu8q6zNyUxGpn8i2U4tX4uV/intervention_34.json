He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's vegan sister is raising her nephew vegan since birth. The author, when babysitting, offers vegan snacks and a separate non-vegan meal for their own kids. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, and the author doesn't tell the sister. The husband is upset about this, thinking the author is being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The sister is strict about veganism for ethical reasons, and the author is in a position of caring for the nephew. The nephew is 10, which is considered old enough to make some choices, maybe. But the sister might not be aware that her son is eating meat when he's with the author. The author is choosing not to inform her, which the husband disagrees with.\n\nFirst, the author is providing vegan options as per the sister's request, which shows consideration for the sister's beliefs. But the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food. The author might be respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the sister's values are important. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to enforce the sister's dietary rules? The author isn't the parent, so maybe they aren't obligated to monitor the nephew's every choice. The nephew is in a social setting with peers, and the author is providing both options, which could be seen as allowing the child to explore, which is part of growing up. But the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, thinking the author is enabling the child to disobey her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat; they're just not stopping him. The line between respecting a child's choices and respecting a parent's wishes is blurry here. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as keeping the peace and not interfering in parenting decisions, but it might also be seen as not being honest about what's happening. \n\nThe key points are the sister's strict veganism, the nephew's autonomy, and the author's role as a caregiver. The author isn't causing harm by not reporting; they're providing options and not forcing anything. The sister's potential reaction is a concern, but the author's husband's opinion might be based on different values. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're balancing respect for the nephew's choices and the sister's beliefs without being intrusive. The answer would be B: No.\n"
