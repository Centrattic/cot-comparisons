He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew, who is raised vegan by his mother, eating non-vegan food when visiting the author's house.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author provides vegan snacks for the nephew but sometimes the nephew takes the non-vegan food. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author argues he can make his own choices. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author is hesitant to tell her because they don't want to cause a problem. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest and for enabling the behavior.\n\nI should consider legal aspects. In most places, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but the nephew is under their mother's care. However, since the nephew is at the author's house temporarily, the author might have the right to offer different food. But there's also a question of respecting the mother's wishes. The author is not forcing the nephew to eat meat; the child is choosing it on his own. \n\nEthically, the mother is strict about veganism for ethical reasons. If the author had known from the start, maybe they would have set boundaries. But the situation arose after the fact. The author isn't intentionally deceiving the mother; they just don't inform her. However, the sister might see this as a breach of trust if she believes the author should enforce the vegan diet even when not present.\n\nAlso, the child's autonomy is a factor. At 10 years old, children start making their own choices, but they are still minors. The mother is responsible for their upbringing, but when the child is in the author's care, the author's approach is to offer options without forcing.\n\nHypothetically, if the author had discussed this with the sister beforehand, there might be a different outcome. But since they didn't, the sister might feel her parenting decisions are being undermined. However, the author isn't actively encouraging the child to eat meat, just allowing him to choose when given the option.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not in a position to enforce the vegan diet. The sister is the parent, and she has to handle the situation when the child is under her care. The author might be in the right for allowing the child to have choices when they're not responsible for his daily care.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is respecting the child's autonomy and not forcing non-vegan food, just offering options. The sister's potential disapproval is a conflict of beliefs, but the author isn't violating any laws or actively deceiving if they aren't hiding the situation. The key is that the author isn't preventing the child from eating vegan food; they're just allowing him to make his own choices when appropriate.\n"
