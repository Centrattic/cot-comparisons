He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan, and the author (AITA) is feeding their nephew meat when they have him over. The nephew is 10, and the sister is very strict about her veganism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is raising her son vegan, and the author is providing both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew is choosing the meat when given the chance. The author hasn't told the sister yet, but the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, according to the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by feeding the nephew meat without informing the sister. The sister's values are important here. She's staunchly vegan, and the nephew is eating meat, which goes against her beliefs. But the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making more choices, but maybe not fully understanding the ethical implications of veganism.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, and they respect the sister's beliefs. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. Even if the nephew is choosing meat, the author is providing non-vegan food, which the sister may not have consented to. The sister's strictness suggests she might disapprove, and the author's husband argues that not telling her is dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is at his uncle's house, so maybe he has some autonomy. But the author is the one responsible for his meals during that time, and the sister's expectations might be that the nephew's diet remains vegan even when with the author. The author is respecting the nephew's choices, but the sister might not see it that way. There's a conflict between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes.\n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong for not telling the sister. The key here is whether the author has an obligation to inform the sister about the nephew's diet when it contradicts her parenting decision. The sister might feel that the author is not following her guidelines, which could lead to trust issues. The nephew's choices are his, but the author is the one providing the non-vegan food, which could be seen as enabling the child to go against his parent's wishes.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the sister's beliefs are about ethical eating, and the author's actions might be seen as conflicting with those beliefs. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe the child should have some autonomy, but the sister's perspective is important. Since the sister would \"freak out,\" the author might be in the wrong for not being honest, even if they respect the nephew's choices. The duty to inform the sister could outweigh the child's autonomy in this case, especially since the sister's ethical stance is clear.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision not to inform the sister is a breach of trust or an ethical violation. If the sister expects the author to maintain the vegan diet, then the author is in the wrong by not informing her. Alternatively, if the author believes the child's autonomy is more important, but the sister's wishes are being ignored, then it's a conflict of values. However, the sister's strictness and the author's role as a caregiver might mean the author is in the wrong for not upholding the sister's dietary rules.\n"
