He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan snacks provided. The author doesn't tell the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The mother is strictly vegan, and the author respects that. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, is he old enough to make his own dietary choices? The author argues that he is, while the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the mother. \n\nBut the key points here are the mother's wishes versus the child's autonomy. The mother is raising her son vegan for ethical reasons, so she might view this as a breach of trust. However, the child is in a different environment, and maybe he's just trying new things with friends. The author is providing vegan options but allowing the child to choose non-vegan if he wants. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to enforce the mother's dietary rules? The author is not the parent, so maybe they shouldn't be the one policing the child's choices. But they are acting as a caregiver for part of the day. If they knew the child was eating non-vegan food, should they inform the parent? \n\nThe child is old enough to express his own preferences, and maybe he's making his own choices now. The author might believe in the child's autonomy, while the mother might see this as undermining her parenting. It's a conflict between respecting someone else's parenting style and respecting a child's growing independence.\n\nIn such cases, it's tricky. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat; they're just allowing it. The mother might not like it, but unless there's a health concern, it's more about personal beliefs. The author is trying to be respectful by not making a big deal, but the husband thinks they should be honest. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're respecting the child's choices while still offering vegan options. The mother might be upset if she finds out, but the author isn't violating any laws or causing harm. It's a personal belief conflict, and the author is trying to balance respect for the mother's views with the child's autonomy.\n"
