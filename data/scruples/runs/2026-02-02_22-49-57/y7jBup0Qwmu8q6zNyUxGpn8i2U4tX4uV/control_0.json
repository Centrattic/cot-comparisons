He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a vegan nephew who sometimes eats meat when visiting the author's house. The sister is very strict about being vegan, but the nephew occasionally eats meat at school. The author is giving him vegan options but doesn't stop him when he chooses non-vegan food. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister is raising her son vegan, so the author's actions might be conflicting with the sister's values. However, the nephew is 10 years old, which is a time when kids start making their own choices. The author is providing vegan options but not enforcing them. The nephew is choosing to eat meat, possibly influenced by his friends at school. \n\nThe key points here are: the author isn't forcing the child to eat vegan, but they also aren't informing the parent. The sister might be upset if she finds out. The author respects the sister's beliefs but also sees the child as old enough to decide. \n\nIs the author being dishonest? They aren't lying, but they aren't disclosing the nephew's choices. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting. However, the author isn't giving the non-vegan food with the intention of going against the sister's wishes; they're allowing the child to choose. \n\nLegally, the author isn't doing anything wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. The sister's beliefs are important, but the child's autonomy is also a factor. The author's husband feels they're in the wrong because they didn't inform the sister. But the author argues that the child should have some freedom. \n\nI think the answer depends on whose perspective you take. If the sister's strictness is about the child's health or ethics, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if it's about respecting the child's choices, then not. However, since the author is the one handling the food and not informing the parent, it could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they're allowing the child to explore different choices, especially since he's already exposed to meat at school. The sister might not have considered that the child is influenced by peers. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're not forcing the child to eat non-vegan food and are providing vegan options. But the lack of communication might be an issue. However, the sister's reaction is also important. If the author is respecting the sister's wishes by not informing her, maybe they're justified. But if the sister's rules are part of a custody or care agreement, then the author might be overstepping. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is allowing the child to make his own choices and isn't violating any laws or agreements, maybe they're not in the wrong. The sister's potential disapproval isn't a legal or moral obligation the author has to uphold beyond what was discussed. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
