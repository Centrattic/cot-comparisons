He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat despite his mother's strict vegan upbringing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew is 10 years old and has been vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals but also non-vegan options. The nephew often chooses the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told his sister. The sister is very strict about being vegan, and the author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not telling the sister. The sister's beliefs are about ethical eating, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is old enough to make choices, but he's a child, so maybe his autonomy isn't the main factor here. The author is respecting their sister's wishes by not telling her, but the sister might see it as deception.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between respecting the child's choices and respecting the parent's dietary beliefs. The author might feel they're giving the nephew a chance to explore his preferences, but the sister's rules are strict. However, the nephew is in the author's care after school, so the author has a responsibility to adhere to the dietary guidelines set by the parents unless there's an agreement otherwise. \n\nIf the author didn't consult the sister about allowing meat, then they might be going against her wishes. But since the nephew is choosing the meat, maybe the author is trying to be lenient. However, the sister's ethical stance is strong, so not informing her could lead to a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author believes the nephew is old enough. However, at 10, children are still under parental authority in most contexts. The author might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, they might be violating the sister's trust by not communicating. The key issue is whether the author should have discussed this with the sister first. Since they didn't, and they're acting against the parent's explicit wishes, they might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the sister and are violating her dietary rules for her child without her consent.\n"
