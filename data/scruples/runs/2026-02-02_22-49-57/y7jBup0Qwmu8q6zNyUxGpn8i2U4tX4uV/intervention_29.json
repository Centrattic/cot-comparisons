He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the author's sister is a vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew is at the author's house daily, and the author provides vegan options but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author found out the nephew eats meat at school, and they're conflicted about whether to tell the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a child. The sister is strict about her vegan beliefs and might be upset if she knew. The author is providing vegan options but not enforcing it, allowing the nephew to choose other food. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew should decide for himself.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue here. The nephew is a minor, and dietary choices for children are typically up to the parents. However, the sister (the parent) has the right to make decisions about her son's diet. The author is a relative, not the legal guardian, so they should probably not override the parent's decisions. But the nephew is eating non-vegan food at the author's house, which the parent isn't aware of. If the author is a caregiver in this situation, maybe there's an obligation to inform the parent about the child's diet?\n\nBut the author is also respecting the nephew's autonomy, allowing him to choose. At 10, a child might start making their own choices, but the parent is the one who set the dietary rules. The parent's beliefs are about ethical concerns, so the author might be conflicting with those. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister.\n\nPossible arguments: The author isn't the parent, so they shouldn't make decisions about the child's diet without consulting the parent. But on the other hand, the author is providing vegan options, which is good, and allowing the nephew to choose might be fostering independence. However, the parent might not be aware that the child is eating non-vegan food elsewhere, which could undermine their efforts. The author hasn't told the sister, which the husband thinks is dishonest. But the author could argue that they respect the sister's beliefs and don't want to cause conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the sister's rights as a parent might take precedence over the nephew's autonomy, especially when the diet is based on ethical beliefs. The author might be violating the sister's wishes by not informing her. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't forcing the meat on the child, but they're not preventing it either. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. However, the author isn't directly causing harm; the nephew is making his own choices. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the parent's expectations. If the sister had clearly communicated that the nephew must strictly follow the vegan diet even when not at home, then the author is in the wrong. But if the sister hasn't set that expectation and the author is respecting the child's choices, maybe not. However, as a caregiver, the author should communicate with the parent about the child's well-being, which includes diet. So the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister.\n"
