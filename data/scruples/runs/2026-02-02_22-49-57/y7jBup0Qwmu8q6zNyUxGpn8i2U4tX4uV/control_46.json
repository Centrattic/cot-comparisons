He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food that the author provides for their own family. The author made separate vegan meals for him, but he ends up choosing the regular chicken nuggets when left alone.\n\nSo the key points here are the sister's strict veganism and the nephew's age, which is 10. The author is in a position where they have to decide whether to report this to the sister. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, while the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. The sister is raising her child vegan, which she sees as ethical. If the child is eating meat when not under her supervision, she might be upset because it goes against her beliefs. However, the nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own decisions, but is he old enough? There's a line between respecting parental choices and allowing a child to make choices that parents disagree with. \n\nThe author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew when he chooses the non-vegan food. Is that being dishonest? Well, the author isn't actively promoting the meat, but they aren't stopping it either. The sister might view this as undermining her dietary choices. But on the other hand, the nephew is making his own decision, and the author isn't forcing him. \n\nLegally, the nephew's parents have the right to raise him vegan, but when he's in the author's care, the author has some responsibility. However, the author might believe that the child should have some autonomy. But since the child is under 18, the parents' rights might outweigh the child's autonomy in this case. \n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The author is respecting the nephew's choices, but the parents' wishes are being disregarded. The sister might see this as a breach of trust. But the author isn't intentionally misleading the sister; they're just allowing the nephew to choose when he's not at home. \n\nThe husband's argument is about honesty. If the author doesn't tell the sister, they might be considered dishonest. But the author might not want to cause a conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whose perspective you take. From the sister's side, yes, because she's raising her child vegan and the author is allowing the child to eat meat against her wishes. From the author's side, they might be supporting the nephew's autonomy. But legally and ethically, parents have the right to set dietary rules for their children. The author's actions might be seen as interfering with that, even if unintentionally. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're allowing the child to eat non-vegan food when the parent explicitly raised him vegan. Even though the nephew is making choices, the parents' authority is important here. The author's not being dishonest per se, but they are not respecting the mother's wishes when the child is under their care. So they should inform the sister to align with the parents' wishes.\n"
