He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a strict vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The author doesn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's values are important here. She's very strict about veganism, so if the nephew is eating meat, she would probably be upset. The author is in a position where they have to decide whether to respect the sister's wishes or the nephew's autonomy.\n\nThe nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making their own choices, but they're still children. However, the mother has explicitly chosen a vegan lifestyle for him. So there might be a conflict between the child's autonomy and the parent's parenting decisions. \n\nThe author is providing vegan options but not forcing the nephew to eat them. The nephew is choosing the meat, which might be because he's curious or his friends eat meat. The author might be trying to be lenient, allowing the child to explore different choices. But the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author might think that the nephew is old enough to decide. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister, which could lead to the sister being upset if she finds out. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is respecting the nephew's current preferences but not respecting the sister's rules. It's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's decisions. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, just not preventing it. \n\nI think the answer would depend on the context of the relationship. If the sister had explicitly asked the author to keep the meals vegan, then the author might be in the wrong. But since the author is making separate vegan meals and the child is choosing otherwise, it might be a gray area. However, the sister's strict stance suggests that she would not want the child to be exposed to meat. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the sister might feel betrayed. The author is allowing the child to make choices, which is reasonable for a 10-year-old, but the sister's rules are about how the child is raised. The key point is whether the author is complicit in the child eating meat against the mother's wishes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not at fault because they are providing the vegan options and not forcing the meat. The child is making his own choice, which is part of growing up. The author isn't intentionally violating the sister's rules, just not enforcing them. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're allowing the child to explore his choices, respecting his autonomy, and not forcing meat on him. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author isn't acting maliciously. They're providing vegan meals and the child is choosing otherwise. The author's intentions are to be lenient and not to meddle in the sister's parenting beyond providing the options.\n"
