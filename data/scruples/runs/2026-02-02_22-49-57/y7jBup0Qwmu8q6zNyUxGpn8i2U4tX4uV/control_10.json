He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author is responsible for him after school, providing snacks and dinner. The author usually makes both a family meal and a separate vegan dish for the nephew. But then, the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan chicken nuggets, even though he was given vegan options. The author found out but didn't tell the sister, and now the husband is upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are about the nephew's autonomy versus the parents' dietary choices. The sister is very strict about her veganism, and the author is trying to balance respecting that with the nephew's choice. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's old enough to make his own decisions, but he's still a child, and parents usually make dietary choices for their kids, especially if they're based on ethical beliefs. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting decisions. Even if the nephew is choosing to eat meat when given the chance, the parents have a right to enforce their dietary rules at home. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be considered a breach of trust, especially since the sister's views are strong. However, the author might argue that the nephew is exploring his own choices, which is normal for a 10-year-old.\n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the author is acting as a caregiver and should have communicated with the sister about the situation. Not informing her could lead to the child continuing to eat meat against their parents' wishes. The husband's concern about dishonesty is relevant here. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't discuss the situation with the sister, even though their intention was to respect the nephew's autonomy. However, the sister has the right to know about her child's diet during the time he's under someone else's care. So, the author's choice to keep it a secret could be problematic. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have talked to the sister about it instead of just letting it happen. The sister might appreciate being informed so she can address the situation with her son. Since the nephew is old enough to have some autonomy, the sister might also see the value in allowing him to explore his preferences. But without communication, the author is making assumptions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and letting the nephew eat non-vegan food without her knowledge.\n"
