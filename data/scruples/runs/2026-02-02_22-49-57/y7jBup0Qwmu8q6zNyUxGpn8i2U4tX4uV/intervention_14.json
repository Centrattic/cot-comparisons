He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is at the author's house five days a week for snacks and dinner. The author makes a vegan dish and another regular one. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food when left alone, even though the author didn't encourage him to. The sister would be upset if she knew. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling her, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew from choosing the non-vegan food. The nephew is 10, which is a bit young to make fully informed dietary choices, especially when it's against his parent's wishes. However, the author isn't actively giving him meat, just not stopping him when he takes it. The sister's strict veganism is important to her, so the author's decision not to inform her could be seen as respecting her wishes indirectly.\n\nBut wait, the sister didn't specify that even when her son is at the author's house, he should never have meat. The author might assume that the child needs to be given the choice, but the parents' rules might extend to other people's homes. However, the author is providing the vegan options, which aligns with the sister's wishes, but isn't preventing the child from making his own choices when unsupervised.\n\nMoral dilemma here: Is the author respecting the child's autonomy or undermining the parents' authority? At 10, children can be curious, but dietary choices, especially ethical ones, are usually parent decisions. The author's sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, even if the author didn't force the child. The author's husband argues they're being dishonest, which could be a valid point because the sister might expect them to uphold the vegan policy even when she's not present.\n\nBut the author isn't lying; they're not actively feeding the child meat. They're allowing the child to choose in their absence. The sister might not have communicated that the child shouldn't have meat even when with others. So, the author might be in a gray area. Ultimately, whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the sister intended the vegan rules to apply everywhere, which isn't clear. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be an attempt to respect both the sister's wishes and the child's autonomy, but if the sister considers this a violation, then the author could be seen as in the wrong.\n"
