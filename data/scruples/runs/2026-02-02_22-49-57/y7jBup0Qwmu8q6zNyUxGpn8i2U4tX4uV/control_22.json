He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a vegan nephew who's being given non-vegan food by his uncle, and the uncle is unsure if he should tell the sister, the mom.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old. The parents are raising him vegan, so they probably have strong beliefs about it. The uncle provides both vegan and non-vegan options, but the nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan ones. The uncle hasn't told the mom yet because he thinks the nephew should make his own choices. The husband thinks the uncle is at fault for not being honest and not informing the sister.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, the parents are responsible for their child's diet, so unless there's a health issue, maybe the uncle isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, though, it's about respecting the parents' wishes. The uncle is aware of their strict vegan stance and might be undermining their parenting choices by not enforcing the vegan diet. However, the uncle is giving options, which could be seen as supporting the nephew's autonomy. But since the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions, the uncle's actions might be seen as overstepping or not respecting their authority. The nephew is old enough to understand, but the parents' beliefs are about ethical choices, not just health. So the uncle's compromise could be conflicting with the parents' values. \n\nOn the other hand, the uncle isn't forcing the non-vegan food; he's offering both. The nephew is making his own choice, which might be developmentally appropriate for a 10-year-old. The uncle's reasoning is that the nephew should have autonomy, which is a valid point. However, the parents might see this as enabling the child to ignore their ethical beliefs. The uncle's husband thinks it's dishonest not to tell the sister, which adds another layer. \n\nSo, is the uncle in the wrong? It depends on whose side you take. If the parents' wishes are paramount, then yes, the uncle is not adhering to their guidelines, which could be considered wrong. But if the uncle believes in the child's autonomy and the parents are strict, then maybe he's not. The key factors are respect for parental authority versus the child's choice. Since the parents are the ones responsible for the upbringing, the uncle's actions might be seen as violating their trust. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the child's autonomy and the uncle providing options. However, the parents' stance is about more than health; it's ethical, so the uncle's actions might directly contradict their beliefs. So leaning towards A.\n"
