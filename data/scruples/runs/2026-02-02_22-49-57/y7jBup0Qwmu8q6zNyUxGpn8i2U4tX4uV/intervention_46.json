He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a nephew who's been raised vegan since birth. The author, who's the sister, provides vegan snacks but sometimes the nephew eats non-vegan options like chicken nuggets when available. The nephew shares meat with his friends at school, and the author doesn't tell her sister about this. Her husband thinks she's in the wrong for not informing her sister and being dishonest, but she believes the 10-year-old should decide his own diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The sister is very strict about veganism, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is an age where kids can start making their own choices, but he's still a minor, right? So the parents have some responsibility in his dietary choices. However, when he's at his aunt's house, the aunt is responsible for what he eats there. \n\nThe aunt is providing vegan options, but she's not stopping him from choosing non-vegan food. That seems like she's respecting his autonomy to some extent, but also not enforcing her sister's dietary rules. The sister might argue that the aunt is undermining her parenting choices. But the aunt could say that it's her home and she's giving him options, which he's using. \n\nBut then there's the issue of honesty. The aunt is not telling her sister about this situation. Her husband thinks it's dishonest, but maybe the aunt is trying to avoid conflict. However, by not informing the sister, she might be keeping a secret that the sister has a right to know as a parent. \n\nLegally, the parents have the authority to make dietary decisions for their child, especially if it's a matter of their ethical beliefs. But the aunt is in a position of temporary care, so she's supposed to follow the parents' guidelines. If she's not doing that, maybe she's breaching that trust. However, the nephew is choosing to eat meat on his own, and the aunt isn't forcing him. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the key points are: the aunt is providing the vegan options as instructed, but the child is choosing otherwise. She's not actively encouraging him to eat meat, just allowing him to make his choice. But the parents might see this as a violation of their parenting. The aunt's decision not to inform them could be seen as dishonest, especially if the parents had clearly communicated their expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the aunt might believe that the child's autonomy is important and that his friends at school share meat, so he's already exposed. She's not forcing him to eat meat, just not stopping him. But the parents might view this as not upholding their values. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the aunt had agreed to strictly follow the sister's dietary rules, then she might be in the wrong by not enforcing them. However, if she's giving the child options and allowing him to choose, it's more about respecting his autonomy. The husband's point is about honesty\u2014maybe she should have told the sister. But the aunt might think it's her choice as a parent to give options. \n\nIn the end, I think the aunt isn't in the wrong because she's providing the vegan options as instructed and the child is making his own choices. She's not forcing him to eat meat. However, the issue of not informing the sister is a point of contention. But since the nephew is at her house, she's in a position to let him explore different choices, and the sister might need to address the school situation if she's concerned about him eating meat there. The aunt's actions don't seem malicious. So the answer would be B.\n"
