He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, which goes against their sister's strict vegan beliefs. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew, who is 10 years old, eats meat at school sometimes. The author provides vegan meals but also offers non-vegan options. When the nephew chooses the non-vegan food, the author doesn't say anything. The sister's husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main ethical dilemma here is about respecting the parent's wishes versus the child's autonomy. The sister has a strong ethical stance, so the author not informing her could be seen as deception. However, the nephew is a child, and the author might be allowing him to explore his choices.\n\nI should consider if the author has a duty to inform the parent about the child's diet, especially since it's against the parent's beliefs. On the other hand, the nephew isn't being forced; he's making his own choices, which might be part of his development. But parents typically make decisions about their child's diet, so the author is interfering in that.\n\nAlso, the author's husband thinks it's dishonest. Maybe the sister has a right to know if her child is eating non-vegan food against her wishes. However, the nephew is old enough to understand and choose, but he's still a child, so the parent's wishes might take precedence.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and context. The author's intent isn't to deceive but to allow the child to choose. However, the sister's rules are strict, so not informing her could breach trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the sister's wishes. But if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe there's a balance between autonomy and parental control.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. But in most cases, parents expect others to respect their child-rearing decisions. So, the author is not respecting the sister's dietary choices for her child, hence in the wrong. But there's also the child's autonomy angle. However, at 10, the child is still under the parent's care. So the author is likely in the wrong for not informing the sister, as the parent has the right to know and enforce their rules.\n"
