He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son vegan, but the nephew is eating meat when at the author's house.\n\nFirst, the author provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew chooses the non-vegan food, which the author doesn't stop. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author argues he's old enough to make his own choices. The sister would be upset if she knew, and the husband is upset the author didn't tell her.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, there's no law against feeding someone meat unless it's their child. Since the nephew is not the author's child, but the sister's, there might be an ethical obligation to respect the sister's wishes. However, the nephew is at the author's home, and the author is providing food. The nephew is making his own choices, which might be seen as his right as a child, even if it goes against his parents' beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position of responsibility when caring for the nephew. If the sister explicitly said the child must be vegan, then the author might be in the wrong for not following those instructions. But in the scenario, the author didn't mention the sister giving explicit instructions. The sister just raises the child vegan, so the author might assume that's a family choice they respect.\n\nThe key points are: the author is providing vegan options, the nephew chooses non-vegan, the author doesn't force him. The sister's stance is ethical, but the nephew's autonomy as a child is a factor. There's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and allowing the child to explore food choices.\n\nIn some cases, parents have strict dietary rules for their children, and caregivers are expected to follow them. If the author didn't clarify with the sister about the dietary rules, they might be in the wrong for not confirming. However, the author might think they're giving the child options, which is a middle ground. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author's intention is to respect the child's choices once he's of an age where he can make them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're providing options and the child is making choices, but there's a gray area if they should have communicated with the sister. However, since the author didn't force the meat on the nephew and allowed him to choose, it's a bit more complex. But in most cases, unless there's a strict agreement in place, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The sister might be upset, but the author's actions don't seem malicious.\n"
