He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but the author often provides him vegan snacks and meals. However, the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets, when he's at their house. The author hasn't told the sister about this because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The sister is very strict about her veganism, and the author's husband thinks they should have told the sister. The author, on the other hand, believes the nephew is 10 and should decide for himself. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are important, but the nephew's autonomy is also a factor. Since the nephew is 10, he's a minor, so his parents (the sister) are responsible for his diet. However, the nephew is old enough to have some awareness of his choices. But in many legal systems, children under 18 don't have the legal capacity to make such decisions independently. \n\nThe author is providing vegan options, which shows they respect the sister's wishes, but the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food. The author isn't forcing the meat on him; it's the nephew's choice. However, by not informing the sister, the author might be withholding information that the sister values. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has an obligation to inform the sister. If the author is the caregiver in this temporary setting, they might have a duty to the parents to follow their dietary guidelines. But if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't responsible for enforcing the vegan diet. \n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest\u2014if the nephew is getting enough nutrition from the vegan options and the non-vegan meals are just occasional snacks, maybe it's not a major issue. But if the sister is strict and the author knows she would be upset, there's a potential conflict between respecting the sister's wishes and the child's autonomy. \n\nLegally, since the author isn't the parent, they might not be in the wrong for not enforcing the diet. Ethically, the situation is more nuanced. The author could be seen as not respecting the sister's parenting choices by not informing her, but on the other hand, allowing the child some autonomy. \n\nIt's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they are providing the correct meals but not preventing the nephew from making his own choices. The sister might need to address the situation if she's concerned, perhaps by discussing with her child or adjusting the snacks brought to the author's house. \n\nHowever, if the author is in a position where they are responsible for the child's care during pickup, they might have a duty to follow the parent's dietary instructions. In that case, not informing the sister could be seen as a breach of trust, making the author at fault. \n\nBut given that the nephew is choosing the meat on his own, the author isn't actively encouraging it. It's about whether the author should be the one to enforce the diet. Since the child is with the author only temporarily, the responsibility lies more with the parents to manage their child's diet. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on the author's role. If they're just a temporary caregiver, they might not be in the wrong for not enforcing a strict diet when the child is making choices. But if they're supposed to ensure the diet is followed, then they are in the wrong. Since the author is providing vegan options and not forcing the meat, they're respecting the sister's wishes as much as possible. The nephew's choices are his own, so the author isn't directly responsible. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
