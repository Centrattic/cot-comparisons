He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the sister raising her son vegan since birth, and the author providing both vegan and non-vegan snacks. The nephew ends up eating the non-vegan options, and the author is conflicted about whether to tell the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is strict about veganism, and the nephew is 10 years old. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew from eating the non-vegan food when he chooses. The husband thinks the author is dishonest for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should decide for himself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's decision to raise her son vegan is her choice, and she might have specific reasons, ethical or health-related. However, the nephew is 10, which is an age where children can start making some choices, especially regarding food. The author isn't forcing the meat on him; they're offering vegan options but allowing him to choose. The sister might not be aware that the nephew is eating meat at school or with friends, so the author's keeping it quiet could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy or protecting him from parental pressure. On the other hand, the sister might see it as a betrayal of her parenting choices.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't violating any laws or causing harm. They're providing food choices and not actively hiding the fact from the nephew. The sister's potential reaction is more about her own beliefs rather than the nephew's health. The author's actions don't force the child to eat meat; the child is choosing. Also, the author isn't lying to the sister; they just haven't informed her. It's a matter of whether they should. Since the nephew is old enough to make choices, the author's approach seems reasonable. The husband's opinion is that it's dishonest, but the author's reasoning is about the child's autonomy. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
