He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the author's sister is a vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is 10 years old now, and during the times he's at the author's house, the author provides both a regular meal and a vegan one. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan option, like chicken nuggets, and the author hasn't told the sister, even though her husband thinks they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's veganism is based on ethical beliefs, so she's against animal products. If the nephew is eating meat when he's not at home, that's something she's aware of, but she might not know he's getting meat at the author's house. The nephew is 10, which is a age where kids might start making their own choices, especially if they're influenced by peers at school. The author is providing vegan options but allowing the nephew to choose otherwise, which might be seen as respecting his autonomy. \n\nBut here's the conflict: the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. The author is technically going against her parenting choices. However, the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they're just giving him options. The nephew is making his own choice. So is the author at fault for not enforcing the vegan diet? \n\nAlso, the sister might have strict beliefs, so the author is trying to balance respect for those beliefs with allowing the nephew some freedom. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not informing, which adds another layer. But maybe the author is right in not wanting to interfere unless the sister is concerned about health or safety. Since the nephew is choosing, maybe it's his right to decide what he eats, especially since he's in a different environment.\n\nI need to check if there's any wrongdoing here. The author isn't lying; they're providing options. The nephew is making choices, which the author is allowing. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't violating any rules unless they conspired to hide it. Since the author is not hiding it but just giving the child options, maybe it's not wrong. The key points are autonomy, respect for the sister's beliefs, and the child's choices. So probably, the answer is B (no, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
