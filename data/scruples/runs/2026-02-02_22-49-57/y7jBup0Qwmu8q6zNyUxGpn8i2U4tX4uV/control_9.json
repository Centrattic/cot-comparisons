He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew comes to the author's house for snacks and dinner every day. The author usually makes separate vegan and non-vegan meals. One day, the nephew and the author's son shared chicken nuggets. The nephew said he sometimes eats meat at school when friends share. The author didn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, but the author thinks it's the nephew's choice.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the ethics of dietary choices and parental authority. The sister is strict about veganism, so she might be upset if she knew. The author is a parent figure, perhaps, since they have their own child. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, can he really make decisions about his diet independently? Or is it the parents' responsibility to ensure he follows their dietary beliefs?\n\nI think the author's sister is the one who made the decision to raise her son vegan. The author is providing non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge. The sister might have ethical reasons for being vegan, like not wanting her son to harm animals. If the nephew is eating meat without her knowledge, she might feel betrayed or that her parenting is being undermined. \n\nThe author argues that the nephew is old enough to choose. But at 10, he's still a child. Parents usually have authority over their children's diets, especially when it's about health or ethical beliefs. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without consulting the mother. Even if the nephew says he eats meat at school, the author is enabling that choice in their own home. The sister didn't ask the author to enforce the vegan diet, but if she knew, she might not want the author to provide non-vegan options. \n\nAlso, the author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for being dishonest. The sister has the right to know what's happening during the times she's not present. The author is in a position of trust when caring for the nephew, so not informing the sister could be seen as a breach of that trust. Even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food, the author is still responsible for the meals provided. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're allowing the child to eat against his parent's wishes without consulting them. The sister's beliefs are important, and the author should have communicated with her before letting the child eat meat. The answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
