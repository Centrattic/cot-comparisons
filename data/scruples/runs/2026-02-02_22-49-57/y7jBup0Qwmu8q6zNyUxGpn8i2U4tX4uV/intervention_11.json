He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew's mother is vegan, raises him vegan, and the sister picks him up from school. The nephew is given vegan options, but he sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The sister-in-law is strict about it, and the husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling them. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the age of the child (10 years old), the mother's strict veganism, the fact that the child is making his own choices, and the sister's role in providing food. The question is whether the sister is in the wrong by not disclosing this to the mother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's wishes. She's raising her child vegan for ethical reasons. If the child is eating meat outside of home, that could conflict with her values. But the child is 10, which is old enough to make some decisions, but maybe not fully aware of the reasons behind his mother's choices. The sister is providing vegan options, but the child is choosing otherwise. \n\nIs the sister supposed to enforce the dietary rules even if the child is making his own choices? On one hand, respecting the mother's wishes is important, especially in terms of co-parenting or shared responsibility. On the other hand, the child is old enough to explore his preferences. \n\nAlso, the sister might not want to interfere in the parenting style of her sister. However, the mother might feel betrayed if she finds out through someone else. The sister's husband thinks she's being dishonest. But the sister might believe that the child should have some autonomy, especially since he's interacting with peers who share food. \n\nIn terms of ethics, maybe the sister isn't in the wrong because she's not forcing the child to eat meat. She's offering vegan options, so the child is making his own choice. However, the mother might see this as a breach of their agreement. But the post doesn't mention any prior agreement between the sister and her sister about the child's diet during school pick-ups. \n\nAnother angle: The child is in a safe environment where he can make choices, which might be part of his development. The sister might be encouraging the child's independence. But the mother's values are important, and not informing her could be seen as a lack of respect. \n\nHowever, the sister is not the parent, so maybe she's not responsible for enforcing the mother's rules strictly unless there's an explicit agreement. The sister's actions are within her home, and the child's choices there might be his own. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's providing vegan options and allowing the child to choose, respecting his autonomy while still offering the vegan food. The mother's reaction would depend on her expectations, but the sister isn't forcing the meat on the child.\n"
