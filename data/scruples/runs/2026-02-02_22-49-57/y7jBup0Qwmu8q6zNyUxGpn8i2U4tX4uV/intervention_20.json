He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is vegan and raises her son that way, but the nephew is eating meat when at the author's house. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the kid when he chooses non-vegan food. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong because they didn't tell the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10, which is a bit of a gray area for autonomy. Some might argue that at 10, a child can make some choices, especially about food, but others might say parents are responsible for their child's diet. The sister is strict about her son's vegan diet, so this could be a big deal for her. The author isn't forcing the meat but is allowing it, which might be seen as enabling the child to make a choice against his mother's wishes. However, the author is providing vegan options, so it's not like they're hiding the meat. The nephew is choosing the non-vegan option, possibly influenced by friends. \n\nEthically, the mother has the right to raise her child according to her beliefs, but the author might be respecting the child's autonomy. The conflict is between parental control and child's choice. The author's sister might be upset because she's strict about veganism, so not telling her could be seen as dishonest. But the author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to decide. \n\nLegally, the parents have the authority over their child's diet, so the author might be overstepping. But morally, it's a different question. The nephew is in a different environment, and the author isn't forcing the meat. It's a bit of a dilemma. The answer hinges on whether respecting the child's choices is more important than respecting the parent's wishes. Since the author is not forcing the meat but allowing it, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the sister's right to make decisions about her child's diet is also valid. The answer isn't clear-cut, but the author's actions are more about allowing the nephew's choice rather than imposing their own. So, leaning towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
