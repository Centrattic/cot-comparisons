He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a vegan nephew who's eating meat when visiting the author's house, even though vegan options are provided. The author is conflicted about whether to tell the sister, who is strict about veganism.\n\nFirst, the author's sister is raising her son as vegan since birth. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to understand, but also a child who might not have much choice in his dietary habits at home. The author provides separate vegan meals but the kid sometimes eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The author didn't tell the sister yet, thinking the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, but the author believes the nephew is old enough.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and respect. The sister has specific beliefs about her child's diet, which the author respects. However, when the nephew is at the author's house, the author is in charge of his meals. The nephew is making his own choices there, which might be part of his autonomy. But since the sister is strict, she might not want her child to eat meat outside the home either.\n\nIs the author breaking any trust? The sister might have expected the author to uphold the vegan diet. But the author is providing vegan options, which shows they're trying to respect the sister's wishes. However, allowing the nephew to choose non-vegan food could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10, and at that age, kids often test boundaries and make their own choices, especially if they're curious. The author might be giving the nephew a chance to explore his preferences, which is part of growing up. The author isn't forcing the meat on him; they're just not stopping him when he takes it. The sister might not have considered that her child might want variety, and the author is trying to balance respect for her beliefs with the nephew's autonomy.\n\nBut then again, the sister's stance is about ethical beliefs, which the author respects. So by not informing her, the author might be keeping a secret that could be significant to the sister. However, the nephew is making the choices in the author's home, so the author isn't necessarily responsible for the sister's expectations beyond their own home.\n\nThe key question is whether the author has a duty to inform the sister. If the sister has made it clear that the nephew should remain vegan at all times, then the author might be in the wrong by not informing her. However, if the sister hasn't specified that the nephew's diet must be strictly vegan even when he's elsewhere, then the author isn't necessarily violating any rules.\n\nAlso, the nephew might be eating meat in school as well, so the author's home is just another place where he can choose. The author isn't encouraging it but isn't preventing it either. It's possible the sister would be upset if she knew, but the author is trying to let the nephew make his own choices, especially as he's getting older. This could be seen as supporting the child's autonomy and curiosity.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a tricky position. They respect the sister's values but also see the nephew as a child who might benefit from making his own decisions. The author isn't causing harm by allowing the nephew to eat meat when given the choice, especially if they're providing vegan options. However, the sister might view this as a breach of trust if she believes the author should enforce the vegan diet strictly.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether the author is obligated to enforce the vegan diet beyond the sister's home. Since the author isn't the parent, they might not have that responsibility. The nephew is old enough to make choices, and the author is providing both options. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't in the wrong for respecting the nephew's autonomy and not forcing the vegan diet when it's optional.\n"
