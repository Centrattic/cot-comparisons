He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old now. The author provides vegan snacks and meals each day, but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister, even though her husband is upset about it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about parental authority versus the child's autonomy. The sister is making a choice to raise her child vegan, which is her right. However, the nephew is 10, which is old enough to start forming his own opinions, maybe. But from a legal standpoint, the parents are the ones responsible for the child's diet until they're emancipated. The author is providing non-vegan food, which the sister might not want her son to consume. \n\nThe author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan options, but the nephew is choosing otherwise. Is the author responsible for ensuring the child sticks to the vegan diet? Since the author isn't the parent, maybe there's a gray area. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to understand that the meat isn't vegan, so maybe he's making a choice. But the parents are the ones who set the dietary rules at home. The author is in a position where they're hosting the child, so perhaps they should enforce the parents' rules. \n\nI think there's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some autonomy. But since the parents are strict about the veganism, not informing them could be seen as going against their decisions. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, but allowing it might not be in line with the parents' expectations. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the sister about the situation. The responsibility lies in respecting the parent's dietary choices for their child, even if the child is making his own choices. The author should have discussed it with the sister to find a solution that respects both parties.\n"
