He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, the sister has been vegan for years and is raising her son that way. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's old enough to make choices, but he's still a kid. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school with friends. The author doesn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong. The author thinks the nephew should be allowed to choose.\n\nSo, the key points: The sister's beliefs are important, and the nephew is eating meat when given the chance. But the author isn't forcing the meat on him; they're just not stopping him. The sister might be upset if she found out, but the author believes in the nephew's autonomy. \n\nBut wait, the sister is raising him vegan, so maybe she expects consistency. However, the nephew is at the author's house, and maybe he's just trying new things. The author isn't giving him meat intentionally against the sister's wishes; they provide vegan options and the nephew chooses otherwise. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to enforce the sister's dietary rules? The author might argue that they're not responsible for the nephew's diet when he's there, and that the child should have some freedom. On the flip side, the sister might see it as a betrayal if she finds out. But the author hasn't told her, so maybe they're trying to avoid conflict. \n\nThe nephew is 10, so maybe he's curious about different foods. The author's approach is to offer vegan options and let him choose. The sister might not be happy, but is the author wrong for not stopping the nephew? It's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some independence. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't making the kid eat meat; they're just not enforcing veganism. If the sister is strict, maybe the author should have discussed it with her. But since the author didn't know the nephew ate meat at school, perhaps they thought it was okay to let him have the chance there. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions don't seem malicious. They're providing the options and allowing the nephew to make choices, which could be seen as respecting his autonomy. But the sister might feel it's important for consistency. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're not actively going against the sister's wishes, just not enforcing them, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
