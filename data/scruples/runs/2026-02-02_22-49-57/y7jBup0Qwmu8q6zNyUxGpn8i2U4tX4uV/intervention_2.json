He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their nephew meat without telling their sister, who is a strict vegan.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew is 10 and is being raised vegan by his mother. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The sister would be upset if she knew. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy vs. respect for the sister's beliefs. The nephew is a child, so does he have the right to choose his diet, or does the mother's wishes take precedence? At 10, children can make some choices, but legally and ethically, parents are the ones who make decisions regarding their children's upbringing, including diet. The author is acting as a caregiver, but the mother's rules should be respected. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they provide vegan options. The nephew chooses the non-vegan food when given the chance. However, the mother's rules are part of the child's upbringing. By not informing the mother, the author might be undermining her authority. Even if the nephew is making his own choices, the mother's wishes are part of their household's values. \n\nThe author's intention is to let the nephew have some freedom, but the sister's strict veganism is a core part of her parenting. The author's actions could lead to the child not adhering to his family's values, which the mother might see as a breach of trust. The husband's concern about being dishonest makes sense because it's about respecting the sister's wishes. \n\nSo, while the author's actions might seem lenient and considerate of the nephew's autonomy, the ethical obligation here might be to the mother's parenting decisions. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate with the sister, which could be seen as a breach of trust or undermining her parenting. However, some might argue it's a minor issue given the child's age and the sister's strictness. But given the potential for conflict and the mother's authority, the answer might be A.\n"
