He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author has a vegan sister who raises her 10-year-old son vegan. The author picks up the nephew and their son from school, provides vegan snacks and meals, but the nephew often eats the non-vegan options. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, and the author hasn't told the sister yet, even though the husband thinks they should. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for not telling their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is strict about veganism, and the nephew is eating meat despite the vegan options being available. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The author is not forcing him to eat vegan; they offer both options. The nephew is making his own choice, which could be his right as a child, but his mother's beliefs are strong. \n\nNow, the author's sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy. However, the mother is the one making dietary choices for the child, so if the child is eating meat outside the home, does the mother have a right to know? \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose. There's a conflict between respecting the child's choice and honoring the parent's wishes. \n\nIn some cases, parents have specific dietary beliefs for ethical reasons, and if the child is exposed to non-vegan food elsewhere, the parent might not be aware. The author is in a position where they have to decide whether to inform the sister. \n\nBut since the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, and the child is old enough to make choices, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, the mother has the right to know if her child is not following the diet she set for him. So there's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and the parent's right to know. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't lying; they're providing vegan options and letting the nephew choose. They aren't actively hiding it, but they aren't telling the sister either. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out the author didn't inform her. \n\nBut the author isn't directly responsible for the child's diet, as they're not the parent. The child is making his own choices with the information he has. The author's sister might be upset, but the author isn't the one violating vegan principles; the nephew is choosing to eat meat. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister is the parent, she has the right to know what her child is eating when they're in someone else's care. The author's choice to not inform her could be seen as withholding information that the parent has a right to know. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not telling. But on the other hand, they are respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because they are providing vegan options and the child is choosing, but they should consider informing the sister. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might depend on the perspective. If the parent has a right to know, then the author is in the wrong for not telling. But if the child is making his own choices, then the author isn't at fault. \n\nI think the key is whether the author has a responsibility to inform the parent. Since the parent is raising the child vegan, the author might have a duty to inform them of the child's non-vegan choices when in their care. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister. So answer A.\n"
