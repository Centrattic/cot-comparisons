He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a vegan nephew who's eating meat when visiting the author's house. The author's sister is very strict about being vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10, and the author provides vegan meals but the kid ends up eating non-vegan options when left alone. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and her husband is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister is raising her son vegan, which is her right. The nephew is old enough to understand what he's eating, but he's still a child. At 10, he might not have full autonomy in making dietary choices, especially if his parents are strict about it. The author is in a position where they are responsible for the child during the time they have him. \n\nThe key points are: the author is providing vegan options, but the child is choosing non-vegan. The author hasn't told the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to decide. The husband is concerned about dishonesty. The sister's beliefs are ethical, so she might see this as a betrayal.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mother is the one who has made dietary choices for her child, so if the child is eating non-vegan food against her wishes, the author might be enabling that. But on the other hand, the child is making choices on his own. However, since he's a child, parents typically make decisions for them. The author isn't making him eat meat, but by not correcting him when he takes the non-vegan food, they might be complicit. \n\nAlso, the sister's ethical stance is strong. The author's decision not to inform her could be seen as hiding the truth, which might be dishonest. The author might think it's protecting the nephew's choice, but the mother might see it as undermining her parenting. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have discussed it with the sister first. Since they're responsible for the child during the time they have him, they should have set boundaries that align with the mother's wishes. By not doing so, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the parent about their intentions. \n\nThe nephew's age is a factor. At 10, he might not fully understand the implications of his choices, especially in a strict vegan household. The author's provision of both vegan and non-vegan could be seen as giving him options he shouldn't have, given his mother's beliefs. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the mother's dietary rules and for not informing her, thus potentially deceiving her. However, some might argue that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but given the strictness of the mother's beliefs, the author has a responsibility to uphold that when in their care. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are allowing the child to eat against his mother's wishes without consulting her, which could be considered dishonest and disrespectful to the mother's parenting decisions.\n"
