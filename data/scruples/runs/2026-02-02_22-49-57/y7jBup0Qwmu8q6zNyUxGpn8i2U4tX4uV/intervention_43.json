He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a strict vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, but the nephew often chooses the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, but the author believes the 10-year-old should have some choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, unless there's a custody agreement or specific legal obligation, the author isn't in the wrong. The sister is the parent, so technically, she's responsible for her child's diet. However, the author is in a caretaker role, picking up the kids and providing meals. The key question is whether the author has an obligation to enforce the sister's dietary rules.\n\nEthically, this is a gray area. The sister's beliefs are important, and the author respects them. But the nephew is old enough to make some choices, and the author isn't forcing him to eat meat. The author is providing options, which could be seen as giving him autonomy. On the flip side, the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially if it conflicts with her parenting decisions. The author's husband argues for honesty, but the author's rationale is about the child's agency.\n\nAnother angle is the potential health and safety aspects. If the meat provided was unsafe, that's a different issue, but the author is just offering regular snacks. The nephew's choice to eat non-vegan food might stem from curiosity or peer influence, which the author isn't preventing. The sister's reaction could be emotional, but the author isn't violating any laws or agreements.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author is maintaining a delicate balance. By not informing the sister, they're keeping the peace and respecting the nephew's choices. However, withholding information could cause a breach of trust if discovered. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't violating any laws or clear ethical boundaries. They're providing options and respecting the child's autonomy within a temporary custody situation. The main conflict is between the sister's strict dietary rules and the author's approach. Since the author isn't forcing the meat and is respecting the child's choices, they're likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
