He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son vegan since birth. The author picks up both their kids from school and provides snacks and dinner, making separate meals. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though he's been told they're not vegan. The author didn't tell the sister about this because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The husband thinks they should tell, but the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. The sister is strict about being vegan for ethical reasons. If the nephew is eating meat, that's going against her beliefs. But the nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own decisions. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing the kid to eat them. The question is whether the author is being dishonest or interfering with the sister's parenting choices.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't forcing the kid to eat non-vegan food. They offer both options, and the kid chooses. The author isn't hiding the non-vegan food, just not bringing it up if the kid chooses it. So maybe they're respecting the kid's autonomy. But on the other hand, the sister's decision to raise her child vegan is a parenting choice. If the author is enabling the kid to eat meat, maybe they're undermining that choice. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, not because of the author directly, but because the author didn't inform her. \n\nBut the kid is 10, which is an age where children might explore different preferences. The sister's approach is about instilling her values, but the child might be influenced by peers or just not interested in being vegan. The author's position is that they're not stopping the kid from making his own choices, which is a valid point. However, the sister might see this as interference since the author is in a position of influence over the child during the time they're in her care.\n\nThe husband's argument is about honesty. If the author isn't telling the sister, they're being dishonest. But is it their responsibility to report the kid's behavior? The kid is the one making the choice; the author is just providing options. The sister might not appreciate the author enabling the child to eat meat, especially if it's against her parenting style. \n\nAnother angle: the author is providing vegan options, which shows they're respecting the sister's wishes. But by not saying anything when the kid chooses meat, they're allowing it to happen. Is that being complicit in something the sister would find unethical? It's a balancing act between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children. If the author is in a position where the kid is under their care, they might have a duty to inform the parent if the child is not following the agreed-upon rules. However, the parent might have entrusted the author with the child's care, expecting them to follow the vegan diet. If the author isn't enforcing that, maybe they're in the wrong.\n\nBut again, the kid is making his own choices. The author isn't forcing him, so maybe it's the kid's responsibility. The sister might be upset because the author didn't correct the behavior, but the author could argue that they're not the parent and should respect the child's autonomy. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a tough call. The key points are: the author is providing vegan options, the kid is choosing meat, the author isn't intervening beyond that, and the sister's values are being compromised. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be seen as protecting the kid's autonomy but could also be seen as dishonesty towards the sister. However, since the author isn't forcing the kid, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a case to be made that they should inform the sister because they're in a position of care for the child and need to uphold the parent's dietary rules.\n"
