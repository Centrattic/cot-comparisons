He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the person's vegan sister who raises her son vegan. The nephew is 10 and goes to school with the author's son. The author provides vegan snacks and meals for the nephew but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The author found the nephew and their son sharing the chicken nuggets, and the nephew said he eats meat sometimes at school. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The author is wondering if they should tell the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister is strict about her vegan beliefs, and the author is respecting that by providing vegan meals. However, the nephew is choosing to eat non-vegan food when given the option. The key points are: the nephew is 10, so he's a minor, and the author is acting as a caregiver. The sister's wishes are being followed in terms of providing vegan food, but the nephew is making his own choices. \n\nIs the author wrong for not telling the sister? Well, the author is honoring the sister's request by providing vegan meals. The nephew's choice to eat non-vegan food is his own, even if it's not what his mother wants. However, the sister might feel that the author is complicit in her child not following the vegan diet because they're providing non-vegan options. But the author argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might consider it her responsibility to enforce the vegan diet, and the author not informing her could be seen as undermining her parenting. However, the author isn't forcing the meat on the child; they're providing the vegan meals as instructed. The nephew's choice is autonomous, even if it's not what the mother wants. \n\nIn terms of the author's duty, they are following the sister's guidelines, so they might not be in the wrong. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author isn't violating any rules as long as they provided the vegan options as requested. The nephew's choice is his own, and the author isn't the parent. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan meals and the nephew is making his own choices when given options. The author isn't forcing the non-vegan food, so they aren't at fault.\n"
