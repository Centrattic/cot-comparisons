He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details from the scenario. The sister is a vegan and has raised her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals for the nephew but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options (like chicken nuggets) that the author brings for their own son. The nephew is 10 years old and sometimes eats meat at school. The author hasn't told the sister yet because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but the husband thinks they're being dishonest.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister about the nephew eating meat. The sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" so she might be upset if she finds out. The nephew, being 10, is at an age where he might be curious about different foods, especially if his friends share theirs. The author is trying to respect the sister's beliefs but also thinks the nephew should have some autonomy.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The sister's dietary beliefs are important to her, and she's raising her son vegan. If the nephew is eating meat without her knowledge, she might see that as a breach of trust or a failure to uphold her values. On the other hand, the author isn't forcing the meat on him; they're just not preventing him from choosing the non-vegan option when it's available. The nephew is making the choice himself, which the author respects.\n\nBut there's a potential conflict between the author's autonomy and the sister's wishes. The sister might feel that the author is not being honest by not informing her about the meat consumption. However, the author is providing vegan options and isn't actively hiding the meat; they're just not confronting the situation. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, which is a valid point, but the sister might not see it that way.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position of responsibility for the nephew while he's in their care. If the sister's instructions are to maintain a vegan diet, then not informing her could be considered a failure to follow those instructions. However, if the instructions were more about providing options rather than strictly enforcing veganism, then the author's approach might be acceptable.\n\nIn terms of the author's intentions, they seem to respect the sister's beliefs but also want the nephew to have some choice. The husband thinks they're being dishonest, which leans towards the author being in the wrong. But others might argue that the nephew should have the right to choose, especially in a social context where he's exposed to different foods.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer hinges on whether not informing the sister about the meat consumption is a breach of trust or a necessary respect for the nephew's autonomy. If the sister explicitly asked for the nephew to be vegan at all times, then the author is in the wrong. But if the sister allowed some flexibility, maybe not. However, since the sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" it's likely that she expects strict adherence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not telling her, even if it's out of respect for the nephew's choices.\n"
