He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old. The author provides vegan options but sometimes the nephew takes the non-vegan food. The key points here are the age of the child and the parents' strictness about their vegan lifestyle.\n\nAt 10, the nephew might be old enough to make some choices, but he's still a child. His parents have made a conscious decision about his diet for ethical reasons. The author is aware that the sister would be upset if she knew. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew should have autonomy. \n\nBut here's the thing: when parents make decisions about their children's diet, especially for ethical or health reasons, those decisions are meant to be upheld unless there's a safety concern. The nephew isn't being harmed directly, but the parents' beliefs are being violated. The author's actions might not be illegal, but they're going against the parents' wishes. \n\nThe nephew might be curious or influenced by peers, but the parents have a right to enforce their dietary rules at home. The author is in a position of providing snacks and meals, so they have a responsibility to respect the parents' instructions. Even if the nephew chooses to eat non-vegan food when available, the author should ensure that only vegan options are present. \n\nThe author's husband is right in thinking that not disclosing this to the sister could be considered dishonest. The sister might feel that her parenting choices are being undermined. The line between allowing a child to explore choices and respecting parental authority is important here. Since the nephew is under the care of his mother for most of the time, the author's role is to support that care, not to override it by offering alternative food options. \n\nSo, even though the author has good intentions, they are not respecting the sister's wishes, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're not honoring the parents' dietary rules for their child.\n"
