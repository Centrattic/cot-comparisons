He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister whose son is raised vegan, but when the kid visits the aunt's house, he sometimes eats meat the aunt provides. The aunt is conflicted about whether she's doing the right thing by not telling the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The sister is very strict about her vegan lifestyle, and the nephew is being raised that way. The aunt is making vegan options but the kid is choosing meat. The aunt isn't stopping him, which the husband thinks is dishonest. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make his own choices, but he's under the sister's care otherwise.\n\nSo, the main points are: the aunt isn't informing the sister, the nephew is eating meat against his mother's wishes, and there's a conflict between respecting parental choices and a child's autonomy.\n\nThe sister's beliefs are important, and the aunt is in a position of trust. By not telling the sister, is the aunt violating that trust? Also, the nephew might not fully understand the mother's reasons for being vegan. At 10, he's a child, and his parents make decisions for him. The aunt's actions could be seen as undermining the mother's parenting choices. On the other hand, the aunt is providing the meat, but the kid is choosing it, so maybe it's about freedom of choice.\n\nBut the aunt is responsible for the kid during pickup. If the mother expects the kid to stay vegan, then the aunt's actions might breach that expectation. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, even if the aunt didn't tell her. The husband's perspective is that the aunt is being dishonest, which is a key point. The aunt's defense is about the nephew's autonomy, but the mother's wishes are part of the parenting arrangement.\n\nSo, the aunt is in a tricky spot. Ethically, it's about respecting the parent's wishes versus the child's choices. Since the child is under the parent's care, the parent's wishes take precedence. The aunt's not enforcing the vegan diet might be seen as a violation of the trust the sister has in the aunt to care for her child as per her dietary beliefs. Therefore, the aunt could be in the wrong for not upholding the sister's expectations and for not informing her, which is a breach of trust and honesty.\n"
