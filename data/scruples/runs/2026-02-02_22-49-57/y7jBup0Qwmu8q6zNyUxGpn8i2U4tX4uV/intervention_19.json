He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author's sister is a vegan and has raised her son as a vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old and goes to school with the author's son. The author provides vegan snacks and dinners for the nephew but also makes regular food for their own family. One day, the author finds the nephew and their son sharing chicken nuggets, which aren't vegan. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author continues to offer vegan options but doesn't stop him from choosing non-vegan food if he wants. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is it wrong to allow a child to eat non-vegan food when their parent has strict dietary beliefs? The sister is staunchly vegan and would be upset. The nephew is 10, which is a child, but maybe old enough to understand. The author isn't forcing him; they offer both options. The sister isn't aware of this happening.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy, letting him decide what to eat. However, the sister might feel the author is undermining her parenting choices. But the author isn't violating any laws or strict rules; they're providing food and allowing the child to choose. The husband's concern is about honesty\u2014should the author inform the sister? But the author isn't lying; they just aren't reporting the nephew's choices. Also, the nephew might be making those choices himself, which the author isn't stopping.\n\nIt's a gray area. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew. The key is whether the author has an obligation to inform the sister. Since the author isn't the parent, maybe they don't have that responsibility. The nephew is 10, so while he's a minor, the author isn't his guardian. The author's actions are within their own home, and they're not causing harm. The sister's beliefs are ethical, but the nephew is exposed to different options outside their home.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not intervening or for not informing the sister. The main issue is the sister's potential reaction, but the author isn't obligated to report the nephew's choices unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
