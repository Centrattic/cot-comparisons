He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a vegan and raised her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan snacks but the nephew sometimes eats meat, like chicken nuggets, which the author made for their own family. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're being dishonest. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is strict about veganism, and the author is choosing not to inform her. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but he's only 10. The author is providing vegan options but the nephew isn't choosing them. The question is whether the author is wrong for not telling the sister.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the sister has the right to know what her child is eating, especially since it goes against her ethical beliefs. However, the nephew is at an age where he might be experimenting with different foods, especially if his friends share with him. The author might be protecting the nephew's autonomy, letting him decide what to eat when they're in the author's care.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's sister might feel violated if she finds out through someone else. The author is aware of the sister's stance, so by not informing, maybe they're being deceptive. The husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The author is providing food, and the child is making choices. Ethically, it's about balancing the sister's wishes with the child's autonomy. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but 10 is still a child where parents usually have primary responsibility for dietary choices.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. The sister's values are important, but the child's exposure to different foods might also be part of growing up. However, withholding information from a parent about their child's diet, especially when it's a significant ethical issue, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe they're acting in the child's best interest, but the sister has a right to know. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because not telling the sister could be seen as hiding the truth, even if the author's intentions are good.\n"
