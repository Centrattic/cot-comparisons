He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding her vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10, and she provides vegan options but he sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The sister-in-law's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling, but she thinks the nephew can make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, the nephew is a minor, so his parents have the right to make decisions about his diet. The mother is vegan, which is her choice, but the author is providing alternatives. However, by allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food without informing the mother, there's a possibility of violating the mother's wishes. \n\nEthically, the author respects the mother's beliefs but is allowing the child to make his own choices. However, the mother might see this as undermining her parenting. Since the child is 10, the author might argue that he's old enough to decide, but legally and morally, parents have the authority over their children's upbringing. \n\nAlso, the author isn't lying but isn't being transparent. If the mother knew, she might be upset or worried. The author's husband thinks she's being dishonest, which adds to the tension. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a caregiver, the author might have an obligation to communicate with the parents about any changes in the child's diet. Even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food, the fact that it's happening under the author's supervision without the mother's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of allowing the child to make choices, but she's not fulfilling her duty to inform the parent, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she's not being transparent with the sister, which is a key part of respecting the parent's wishes.\n"
