He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son vegan. The nephew is at the author's house after school, and the author provides both a family meal and a vegan one. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though he's been told they're not vegan. The author isn't telling the sister, and the husband thinks they're being dishonest. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives. The sister is very strict about being vegan for ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's old enough to make some choices, but he's still a child. The parent has the right to decide their child's diet, especially for ethical or health reasons. However, the nephew might be curious or influenced by peers, leading him to try non-vegan food when given the chance.\n\nThe author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan options but isn't stopping the nephew when he chooses the non-vegan food. The author isn't encouraging it either, just not interfering. But the sister isn't aware of this. The husband thinks they should tell the sister, but the author is conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following the sister's parenting decision by providing vegan meals. On the other hand, by not informing the sister about the nephew eating meat, they might be withholding information that the sister would consider important. However, the nephew is making his own choices, possibly out of curiosity or peer influence. The author might be trying to balance respecting the sister's wishes with allowing the child some autonomy.\n\nBut since the author is the caregiver during that time, they have a responsibility to ensure the child adheres to the parent's dietary rules unless instructed otherwise. However, the author isn't forcing the vegan food; they're providing options. The nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, which might be a natural behavior given that he's a child exploring boundaries.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author should inform the sister about the nephew's actions. The sister might see it as a breach of trust if she finds out the author knew and didn't tell her. However, the author could argue that they are respecting the nephew's autonomy and that the sister's strictness might not account for the child's natural curiosity.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author isn't violating any rules directly but is not communicating something that the sister might consider important. The answer depends on whether withholding the information is considered dishonest. Since the author isn't lying but not sharing the full picture, it's a matter of transparency versus respecting the child's choices. In terms of \"am I the asshole,\" if the sister's strict veganism is non-negotiable, then the author's actions might be seen as undermining her parenting choices. However, if the nephew is old enough to make choices, the author might be supporting his autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they are providing the vegan options and not forcing the non-vegan ones. However, the act of not informing the sister could be seen as a lack of transparency, which might make them at fault in the sister's eyes. But since the nephew is making the choices independently, the author isn't directly responsible for his actions. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but this is a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
