He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, and the author provides both vegan and non-vegan meals when the nephew is at their house. The nephew sometimes chooses the meat, and the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, can he truly make his own dietary decisions? Legally, he's a minor, so his parents are responsible for his diet. The mother is raising him vegan because of her ethical beliefs. The author is providing non-vegan food but not actively encouraging it, just allowing the choice. \n\nThe sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" and if she found out, she might be upset. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, while the author believes the nephew can choose. But does the nephew's choice override the mother's wishes? Since he's a child, parents typically make those decisions. The author might be going against the mother's wishes by not informing her, even if the nephew is choosing the meat on his own. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the nephew might eat meat at school sometimes, which the author isn't responsible for, but providing meat at their home could be seen as a breach of the mother's trust. The author is in a position where they're caring for the child while the mother is not present, but they should probably communicate with the mother about this, especially since it's a significant ethical issue for the mother.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they are not respecting the mother's wishes by not informing her. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the parent has the authority to decide his diet. The author's decision to withhold this information could be seen as deceptive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a gray area. However, since the mother's ethical stance is strong, the author should have discussed it with her first. So, answer A."
