He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats meat that's available there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author provides vegan options for the nephew but doesn't stop him from eating the non-vegan food. The nephew is 10 years old, which is an age where some level of autonomy might be expected, but he's still a child. The mother is strict about her vegan beliefs, and the author's husband thinks they should tell the mother, while the author thinks the nephew can make his own choices.\n\nThe main conflict here is between respecting the parents' wishes and the nephew's autonomy. The author isn't forcing the meat on the child; they're just not stopping him from eating it when they provide non-vegan food. The question is whether this crosses into the wrong because it goes against the mother's dietary beliefs.\n\nI should think about legal aspects. In most places, parents have the right to determine their child's diet, and others caring for the child should follow those guidelines unless there's a health risk. However, the nephew is old enough to make choices, but does that extend to dietary choices when he's under someone else's care? Maybe not entirely, since he's still under his parents' care. The author is acting as a caregiver during pickup times, so they have a responsibility to adhere to the parents' wishes unless there's an emergency.\n\nBut the author is providing vegan options, so they're following the parents' guidelines. The issue is that the nephew is choosing the non-vegan food. The author isn't encouraging him to eat meat, just not stopping him. However, if the parents specifically asked the author to ensure the child is only eating vegan food, then the author might be in the wrong by allowing the child to eat meat. But in this case, the author says they provide vegan options and the child chooses otherwise. If the parents knew the child was eating meat at the author's house, they might disapprove. So, is the author in the wrong for not informing the mother?\n\nThere's also the ethical angle. The author respects the mother's beliefs and knows she would be upset. But they also believe the nephew can make his own choices. The author isn't forcing meat on the child, so maybe it's not their fault. However, the caregiver's role might require them to follow the parents' instructions strictly. If the parents hadn't mentioned that the child shouldn't eat meat at all, maybe the author's actions are acceptable. But since the parents are strict, the author might be violating their trust by not informing them.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be exploring his preferences, which is part of growing up. The author could be supporting his autonomy. But again, the child's diet is a parental decision, especially for a 10-year-old. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author doesn't. The key is whether the author has a duty to the parents to enforce the diet, which they might. Therefore, not informing the parents could be seen as a breach of that duty.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they are responsible for the child's care during that time and should follow the parents' dietary instructions. Allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without informing the parents could be seen as going against the parents' wishes. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to make sure.\n"
