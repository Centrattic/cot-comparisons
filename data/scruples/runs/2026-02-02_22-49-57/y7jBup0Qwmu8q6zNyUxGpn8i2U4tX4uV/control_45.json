He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew is being raised vegan by his mother. The author, who picks him up from school, provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes chooses the meat, like chicken nuggets, but the author doesn't inform the sister. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, while the author believes the nephew should decide for himself.\n\nSo, the key points here are the rights and responsibilities involved. The sister is strict about veganism for ethical reasons, and she's in charge of her son's diet. The author is making decisions that go against the parent's wishes. On one hand, the nephew is 10 years old, which is old enough to make some choices, but he's still a child, and his parents' dietary decisions are part of their parenting. The author is technically providing the non-vegan food, which might be against what the parents have agreed upon. \n\nThe parent's trust is important here. The author didn't consult the sister before changing the diet of her child. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat himself, the author is the one offering it. The sister's ethical beliefs are significant, and the author might be undermining those by not informing her. \n\nBut the other side is about respecting the child's autonomy. However, at 10, the idea that he can make his own dietary choices is debatable, especially since minors aren't typically considered to have full autonomy in such matters. Parents have the right to make health and ethical decisions for their children unless there's a concern for the child's welfare. \n\nAlso, the author is aware of the sister's stance and the potential reaction. By not telling her, they might be keeping a secret that could lead to ethical concerns. The author's husband's perspective adds another layer, considering honesty between family members. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical frameworks, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs unless it's harmful. The author is providing food that goes against those beliefs. While the nephew might be curious or influenced by friends, the author's role is to follow the parent's instructions unless there's a conflict. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust and potentially undermining the parent's authority. Even if the nephew is making the choice, the author is enabling that choice by providing non-vegan options. The sister might consider this a violation of her parenting decisions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's wishes and not informing her about the situation.\n"
