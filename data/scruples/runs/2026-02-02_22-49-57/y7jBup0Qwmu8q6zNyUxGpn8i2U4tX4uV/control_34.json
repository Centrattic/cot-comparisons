He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. So first, the sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son that way since birth. The author, who has their own child, prepares separate meals, but the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's already exposed to it there. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband is upset about that.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. They provide vegan options but don't stop the nephew when he chooses the non-vegan food. The nephew is 10, so the author thinks he's old enough to make his own choices. The sister would be upset if she knew, given her ethical stance.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue. The nephew is a minor, but his parent's choice to make him vegan is their decision. However, the author's actions might conflict with the parent's wishes. But the nephew is sharing meals at the author's house, and the author is providing alternatives. The nephew is choosing the meat, which might be his own decision, but the parent might not be aware. \n\nThe author's sister has the right to make dietary decisions for her child. By not informing her, the author is not following her instructions. However, the nephew is old enough to make choices, so maybe he's expressing his own preferences. But the parent's authority here is important. The author is in a position where they're responsible for the child during certain hours, so they should adhere to the parent's guidelines unless there's a medical reason. Since there's no indication of health issues, the parent's wishes should be respected. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister. The sister's ethical beliefs are about her child's diet, so the author might be violating her trust. The author might be in the wrong for not honoring the sister's wishes. However, the nephew is making his own choices, which complicates things. But since the author is in charge during those hours, they should enforce the vegan diet unless the parent says otherwise. \n\nSo the answer might be A (wrong) because the author isn't following the sister's dietary instructions for her child, which could be seen as respecting the parent's authority. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the parent's wishes should be followed unless the child's health is at risk, which isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not adhering to the sister's guidelines.\n"
