He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves a 10-year-old nephew who is being raised vegan by his mother. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan snacks and dinners but doesn't stop the nephew from choosing the non-vegan options when he takes them. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The sister is a staunch vegan and would be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making their own decisions, but he's still a child. The author isn't forcing him to eat vegan, which respects his autonomy. However, by providing non-vegan options, they might be enabling behavior that his mother strictly opposes. \n\nIs the author violating the sister's trust by not informing her? The sister is raising her son vegan, and the author is aware of the ethical stance. By not informing, the author might be keeping a secret that the sister doesn't know about, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the nephew is making the choice himself, which complicates things. The author isn't forcing him to eat meat; they're just not intervening when he does. \n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If the nephew is choosing non-vegan food out of curiosity or peer influence, is it better for the parents to know? The sister might have concerns about his health or values, but the author might be protecting the child's autonomy. However, the mother has the right to know about her child's diet if it's against her parenting choices.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author might see it as respecting the nephew's choices. There's a balance between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes. \n\nIn legal terms, there's no wrongdoing here unless there's a specific legal obligation to inform the parent. Ethically, it's a grey area. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, but they are providing options that conflict with the parent's beliefs. The key question is whether the parent has a right to know about the child's diet when it's contrary to their parenting decisions.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author might not be in the wrong because they aren't forcing the child to eat meat, but there's a valid argument that the parent should be informed. However, the decision to not inform the sister is based on the belief that the child should have autonomy, which is a reasonable stance. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the parent has a right to know, making the answer A. However, since the author is not directly violating any rules and the nephew is making choices on his own, B is more likely.\n"
