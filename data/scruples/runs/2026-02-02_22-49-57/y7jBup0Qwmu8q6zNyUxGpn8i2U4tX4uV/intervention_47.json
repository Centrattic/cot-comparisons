He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person narrating the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, despite the parents' strict vegan upbringing.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, children are developing their own preferences, but they still rely heavily on their parents for guidance. The parents have a strong ethical stance on veganism, so they're likely intentional about their child's diet. The author is in a position where they provide food for the nephew after school, making a vegan dish specifically for him. However, the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food (like chicken nuggets) meant for the author's own children. The author doesn't correct him, probably to avoid conflict with the nephew or to protect their sister's feelings if found out.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is aware the nephew is eating meat, the parents would be upset if they knew, and the author is choosing not to inform them. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the nephew is a minor, so his parents have the legal right to decide his diet. The author's sister made a conscious choice to raise her son vegan, which is a parental right. However, the author's actions might be seen as undermining that choice. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author respects the sister's beliefs but also considers the nephew's autonomy. At 10, the nephew might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism, so his choice could be more about peer influence than personal ethics.\n\nThe question is whether the author has a duty to inform the sister. Since the author is in a caregiving role (picking up the kids, providing snacks), there's an expectation to uphold the dietary rules set by the parents. By not informing the sister, the author could be seen as complicit in the child not adhering to the family's values. On the other hand, the author might argue that it's a minor matter, and the nephew is just exploring his preferences.\n\nBut considering the sister's strong stance and the fact that the author is making vegan meals specifically for the nephew, the author's silence might be a breach of trust. The sister might feel the author didn't respect her parenting choices. The author's husband's concern about honesty is valid\u2014there's a duty to be truthful in such family dynamics.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might be to let the nephew make his own choices, the parents have the legal and ethical right to guide their child's diet. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as it goes against the parents' wishes.\n"
