He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is feeding their vegan nephew meat, right? The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew is at the author's house every day for snacks and dinner. The author makes separate vegan meals for him but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author didn't tell the sister about this because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is a staunch vegan, and she's making sure her son is vegan. If she found out, she might be upset because she believes in her ethical stance. The author is respecting their sister's beliefs but is also allowing the nephew to eat meat. The question is whether the author is overstepping by not informing the sister.\n\nThen there's the nephew's age. He's 10, so maybe he's starting to form his own opinions. But he's still a child, and his parents are making dietary decisions for him. Should the author have a say in that? The author is in a position where they're providing meals, but the parents' rules might take precedence.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew can choose. It's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and letting the child explore. However, the parents' choice to raise their child vegan is a significant decision, so the author might be undermining that by allowing the nephew to eat meat without the parents' knowledge.\n\nAlso, the nephew is already eating meat at school sometimes through friends. The author might be giving him more access without realizing the sister's strict views. The key point is whether the author should have informed the sister, as the nephew isn't making the choice independently in a controlled environment at home. The author is the one offering both options, so maybe they have a responsibility to the parents to keep them informed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they are not upholding the parents' dietary rules for their child, even if it's their own home. The parents have a right to know how their child is being fed elsewhere. Even if the nephew is curious, the parents' ethical beliefs should be respected, and the author's actions could be seen as deceptive.\n"
