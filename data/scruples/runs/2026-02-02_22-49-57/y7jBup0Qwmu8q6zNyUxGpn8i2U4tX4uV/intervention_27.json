He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son as vegan since birth. The author's nephew is 10 years old, and the author picks him up from school, provides snacks and dinner. The author usually makes vegan dishes for the nephew but also makes non-vegan food for their own family. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, but the author doesn't tell the sister. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the nephew is eating meat when given the chance, the author isn't stopping him but also isn't informing the sister. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author respects that. The nephew is 10, which is a young age but maybe old enough to make some choices, depending on cultural or family norms.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the sister has a right to know what's happening with her child's diet, especially if it's against her beliefs. The author isn't actively encouraging the child to eat meat but is allowing it. The nephew is in their care for part of the day, so maybe the author has an obligation to inform the parent. However, the author might think that the child's autonomy is important, even at 10. But in many cases, parents make decisions for their children, especially in matters of diet, health, and ethics. \n\nThe sister might consider the author's actions as undermining her parenting choices. Even if the nephew is choosing to eat meat, the author could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes. On the other hand, the author is providing vegan options and not forcing the meat on the child. The line here is between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is legal guardianship. The author isn't the legal guardian of the nephew, so they might not have the authority to make dietary decisions. However, during the time the nephew is under their care, they have a responsibility to follow the parent's instructions. If the parent explicitly told them to keep the child vegan, then feeding him meat could be a breach of that trust.\n\nBut the sister didn't specify, and the author has been providing vegan options. The nephew is choosing the non-vegan food on his own. The author isn't forcing it. However, the author is aware of the sister's strict stance and hasn't communicated this. The husband's argument is that the author is being dishonest by not informing the sister. \n\nIn many relationships, transparency is important. If the author is aware that the child is eating meat during their care time, they should inform the parent. Not doing so could be seen as not being honest, even if the author thinks it's the right thing for the child. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the child is making his own choices. At 10, he's old enough to express preferences, but parents typically have the final say in dietary matters. The sister might view her child's exposure to non-vegan food as harmful to her values and his health. \n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. They respect the sister's beliefs but also see the nephew as capable of making choices. However, the parent's authority in such matters is usually considered paramount. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as they have a responsibility to uphold the parent's wishes when the child is in their care. The author's choice to remain silent could be seen as a breach of that responsibility, even if they think the nephew's autonomy is important.\n"
