He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew comes to the author's house after school every day, and the author provides vegan snacks and dinner for him. But the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author found out he's eating meat, and he says he sometimes eats meat at school too. The author isn't telling the sister about this, and the husband thinks she's in the wrong for being dishonest. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is 10 and old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is very strict about her veganism, and the author respects her beliefs. But the nephew is a child, and while he's 10, he's still a minor. In many places, parents have the legal right to decide their child's diet, especially when it comes to health and ethical reasons. The sister is making a choice for her child that he can't make for himself yet. So if the nephew is eating meat at the author's house without her sister's knowledge, that might be considered undermining her parenting decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing the vegan options, which is what the sister expects. The nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food on his own. The author isn't forcing him; they're just giving him the choice. The author isn't explicitly teaching him against veganism, just allowing him to eat what's available. The sister might be upset if she found out, but the author is trying to respect the child's autonomy, thinking he's old enough to decide. \n\nBut there's a conflict here between respecting the sister's parenting choices and the child's autonomy. The child is in a situation where he's exposed to different options outside his home. The author might believe they're supporting his autonomy, but the sister might see it as interference. However, the author isn't actively promoting meat-eating; they're just not stopping the child when he chooses. \n\nThere's also the aspect of honesty. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The author might not want to upset the sister or cause conflict, but is it their responsibility to inform her? If the sister's choice is based on ethical beliefs, then the author might think the child should have the right to make his own choices, but the sister might see it as a violation of their home's values.\n\nLegally, the sister is the parent, so she has the right to decide her child's diet. The author is acting as a caregiver when the child is in their home, but they might not have the authority to override the parent's decisions. So even if the author thinks the child is old enough to choose, the parent's wishes should be respected. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit tricky. Some might argue that the author is helping the child explore his own preferences, which is a positive thing. Others might say that the author is not respecting the sister's parental authority. The key point is whether the author is knowingly allowing the child to eat non-vegan food in defiance of the parent's wishes, which could be seen as undermining the parent's authority. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adhering to the sister's parenting decisions, even if they think the child should have autonomy. The sister has the right to make choices for her child, especially when it's about diet, which can have health and ethical implications. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping by not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against her wishes.\n"
