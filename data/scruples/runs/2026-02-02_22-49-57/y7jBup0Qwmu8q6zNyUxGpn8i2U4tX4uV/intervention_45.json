He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is raising her son vegan, and the nephew often eats the non-vegan snacks provided by the author. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling the sister. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, there's no issue here. The nephew is a minor, but the author is not his legal guardian. The sister is the parent making decisions about the child's diet. However, the sister has the right to raise her child as she sees fit, including dietary restrictions. The author is providing food in their home, which is under their control. But since the child is not theirs, they have a responsibility to inform the parent if they're deviating from the parent's wishes.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The sister is strict about her vegan lifestyle, and the author is not following it. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a time when children start making their own choices, but they're still under parental authority. The author could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting choices by giving the child meat without her knowledge. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially since she's raising the child on specific ethical beliefs. The author's husband argues that they're being dishonest, which adds to the ethical dilemma.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the nephew is old enough to make his own decisions, especially since he's choosing the non-vegan option. However, the parent's role is to set boundaries, and the author might be overstepping by not informing the parent. The author could be in a difficult position between respecting the sister's wishes and allowing the nephew some autonomy. But since the parent is the one making the decisions, the author's actions could be seen as going against that.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's rights, the child's age and autonomy, and the author's responsibility to inform the parent. The author's actions might be considered respectful if they're providing the vegan options and the child is choosing otherwise, but the lack of communication with the sister could be a problem. The sister might not have known about the situation and could be upset if she finds out later. The husband's point about honesty is valid because the sister has the right to know about her child's diet when they're in another household.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, they might be ethically in the wrong for not informing the sister about the child's diet during the time he's in their care. The parent's wishes are important, and the author should communicate with the sister to find a solution that respects both parties' values.\n"
