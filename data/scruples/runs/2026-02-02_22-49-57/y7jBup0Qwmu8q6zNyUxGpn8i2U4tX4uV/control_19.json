He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves feeding their 10-year-old vegan nephew meat, even though the sister is strict about veganism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is raising her son vegan, but the nephew has access to non-vegan food at the author's house. The nephew sometimes eats the meat, even though the author provides vegan options. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband is upset about that. The nephew is 10, so the author argues he should make his own choices.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's beliefs are important here. She's strict about veganism for ethical reasons. The author is going against that by giving the nephew meat, which could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting. However, the nephew is a child, and maybe he's allowed to explore different foods. But since the parents are making a conscious choice to raise him vegan, letting him have meat without their knowledge might conflict with their values.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is 10 and might be curious, especially if his friends eat meat at school. The author might feel they're giving him options, which is a way to support his autonomy. But the sister might not appreciate this, thinking it's deceptive or against her parenting. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, which adds another layer.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author has the right to decide on the nephew's diet without consulting the parents. The sister's choice to raise her child vegan is a personal decision, and the author's actions could be seen as interfering. Even if the author respects the sister's beliefs, by not informing her, they might be acting against her wishes. So, the author could be in the wrong because they're not respecting the sister's parenting decisions. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if they believe the nephew should have autonomy.\n\nI think the key here is that the sister is making a choice for her child's diet, and the author is circumventing that by providing non-vegan options. Even if it's for the child's autonomy, the parents have the right to make those decisions. So the author is in the wrong by not respecting the sister's wishes and possibly deceiving her.\n"
