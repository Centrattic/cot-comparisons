He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The author, who has their own child in the same school, usually provides vegan snacks for the nephew. But sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options (like chicken nuggets) offered, even though the author knows this goes against the mother's beliefs. The nephew is 10, so the author thinks he's old enough to make his own choices. The husband thinks they should tell the mother, but the author hasn't.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The sister is raising the child vegan for ethical reasons. The nephew is eating meat when given a chance, but the author isn't actively encouraging it\u2014they just don't stop him. The nephew's choice might be due to curiosity or peer influence. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're providing both options, but the parent's wishes were to keep the child vegan. The author might be overriding the parent's decision by not enforcing the vegan diet. However, the nephew is old enough to make choices, so maybe the author is respecting his autonomy. On the other hand, the parent's ethical stance is important. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, but the author isn't lying\u2014just not informing.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between respecting a child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes is tricky. Since the author is in a position to influence the child's diet (as they provide the meals), not adhering strictly to the parent's wishes could be seen as a problem. However, the nephew is making his own choices, so maybe the author isn't forcing him. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they are providing vegan options and the nephew is choosing. But some might argue that the parent's wishes should be followed strictly. However, the ethical angle here is about the parent's beliefs versus the child's autonomy. Since the child is 10, maybe the author isn't wrong for allowing him to choose. But maybe the parent would want to know. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should tell. The author isn't forcing, just not reporting. So maybe B.\n"
