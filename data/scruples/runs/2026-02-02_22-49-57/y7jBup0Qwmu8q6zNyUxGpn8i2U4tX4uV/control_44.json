He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son vegan. The nephew is at the author's house every day for snacks and dinner, and the author makes both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author provides vegan snacks. The author didn't tell the sister, even though the sister would be upset if she knew.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is very strict about her vegan lifestyle, and the nephew is supposed to be vegan as per her parenting choice. The author is in a position where they provide food for the nephew, and the nephew is choosing meat when given the option. The author is not stopping him, which might be seen as complicity. \n\nThe nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some might argue he's old enough to make his own choices, especially around food. But others might say he's still a child and should follow his parents' dietary rules. However, the nephew is at the author's house, not his own home. The author isn't forcing him to eat vegan; they offer both. But maybe the sister expects the author to enforce the vegan diet when the kid is in their care.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The sister might not be aware that the author is allowing the nephew to eat meat. If the sister is strict, she might consider it a betrayal. On the other hand, the author could argue they're respecting the nephew's autonomy and not policing his choices.\n\nThere's a question about honesty. The author isn't disclosing that they're not strictly enforcing the vegan diet. If the sister asked, would the author lie? That's a factor. Also, the nephew is eating meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's already exposed to it, but the author's house is another source.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility. Since the author is in charge of the meals when the nephew is there, there's an expectation to follow the sister's wishes. If the sister asked the author to provide vegan meals, then serving meat could be a breach of trust. But the author isn't explicitly told, so maybe there's ambiguity.\n\nI need to balance the sister's beliefs and the nephew's autonomy. The author's choice to let the nephew choose might be seen as respecting the child's will, but the sister's strict veganism might override that. The key point is whether the author should have informed the sister about the situation.\n\nIf the author didn't mention it, they might be hiding information. The sister has a right to know if her child is not following the vegan diet she's enforcing. However, the author isn't preventing the nephew from eating vegan; they're giving him options. It's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're not the parent, but the sister might feel they should have upheld her dietary rules. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and family dynamics. Since the sister is very strict, not informing her could be seen as dishonest, making the author at least partially responsible.\n"
