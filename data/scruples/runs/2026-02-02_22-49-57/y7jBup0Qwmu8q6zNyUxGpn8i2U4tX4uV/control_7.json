He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the nephew is 10 years old. The author provides vegan snacks but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The author didn't tell the sister despite knowing she'd be upset.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The sister has a strong ethical stance, and the nephew is old enough to make choices. However, the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions for their child. The author is in a position where they're acting as a caregiver, but the child's dietary needs are set by the parents. \n\nIs the author violating the parents' wishes by allowing the child to eat meat? The parents might see it as undermining their parenting. On the other hand, the author might argue that the child is making his own choices, especially since he's at their house. But the parents could argue that the child should stick to what's agreed upon when under their care. \n\nThe husband thinks the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to decide. But legally and ethically, parents make decisions for their children until they're adults. So even if the nephew wants to eat meat, the parents' choice takes precedence. \n\nThe author didn't inform the sister, which could be seen as covering up the child's choices. If the sister is strict about veganism, this might be a breach of trust. The author is in a middle ground, trying to respect both the sister's beliefs and the nephew's autonomy. But the parents' wishes are the primary consideration here. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't communicate with the sister and allowed the child to eat against the parents' decisions. The child's autonomy is a factor, but the parents' authority is stronger.\n"
