He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10, goes to the same school as the author's son, and they pick him up. The author provides vegan snacks and dinner for him but also makes non-vegan food for the family. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though he's been told they aren't vegan. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing her. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's already exposed to it there.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's strict vegan beliefs and the nephew's age. The sister would be upset if she knew her son is eating meat. The author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan options but isn't stopping the nephew from choosing the non-vegan food. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but he's still a child, so maybe the parents are the ones who set the dietary rules here.\n\nIs the author supposed to enforce the vegan diet strictly, even if the nephew is choosing otherwise? Or is it the parents' responsibility? Since the nephew is in the author's care temporarily each day, maybe the author isn't responsible for enforcing the parents' dietary rules, especially if the nephew is making his own choices. However, the parents might expect the author to maintain the vegan diet as per their wishes. The author is in a position of trust, so not telling the sister could be seen as going behind her back, even if the nephew is making his own decisions. But on the other hand, the nephew might be experimenting or influenced by his peers, and the author is allowing him some choice. \n\nThe sister's stance is ethical, so she might view this as the author undermining her parenting. The husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. However, at 10, a child's dietary decisions are still influenced by caregivers and parents. The author might be overstepping by allowing the nephew to eat meat when it's against the parents' beliefs. Alternatively, maybe the author is giving the nephew some autonomy, which is important for development. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author should have informed the sister. The sister has the right to know if her child is consuming meat against her wishes. The author's actions could be seen as respecting the nephew's autonomy but failing to uphold the sister's parenting decisions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as they are part of the extended family and the sister's trust might be important here. Alternatively, if the nephew is choosing for himself, maybe it's his choice. But in terms of the sister's expectations, the author should have discussed it with her. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with the sister, which might be necessary to maintain trust and adhere to the sister's wishes.\n"
