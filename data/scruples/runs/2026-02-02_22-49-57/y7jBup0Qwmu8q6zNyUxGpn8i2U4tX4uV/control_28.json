He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is strictly vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is at the author's house every day for snacks and dinner, and the author provides vegan options but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong. The nephew is 10.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister's beliefs are strong, so she might be upset if she found out. But the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making their own choices. However, he's still a child, and his mom has been raising him vegan. The author is in a position of responsibility when caring for him. \n\nThe key points are: the author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew when he chooses otherwise. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author is withholding information from the sister, which might be considered dishonest. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to enforce the sister's dietary choices on her child? The sister is the parent, so maybe the author should respect her wishes unless the nephew is in danger. Since the nephew is choosing to eat meat when given the chance, but the author isn't forcing it. However, by not informing the sister, the author is hiding the child's behavior, which could be seen as deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make choices, and the author might believe in his autonomy. But the sister's beliefs are strict, so the author's actions might conflict with her parenting decisions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister's rules are that her son must be vegan, then the author's role as a caregiver would require following those rules. Allowing the child to eat meat against the parent's wishes could be seen as not respecting their parenting. Plus, the author is aware of the sister's strict stance, so they have a duty to inform her. Not telling her is the dishonest part. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are not respecting the sister's parenting decisions and are being dishonest by not informing her.\n"
