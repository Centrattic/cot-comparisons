He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though they prepare vegan options. The sister is a staunch vegan and the nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. At 10, he's probably aware of the vegan diet at home but might want to try other foods when he can. The author provides vegan snacks but doesn't stop the kid from choosing the meat. That seems respectful of the child's autonomy.\n\nThe sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author hasn't told her. The husband thinks it's dishonest, but the author doesn't. The key points here are the child's ability to choose, the parents' strict veganism, and the author's role as a caregiver without enforcing the parents' views.\n\nSo, the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they're giving options. The nephew is making his own decisions. The author is honoring the child's choices, which is a good parenting approach. The sister might not agree, but the author isn't in the wrong for respecting the child's autonomy and not being dishonest since the nephew is making his own choices.\n"
