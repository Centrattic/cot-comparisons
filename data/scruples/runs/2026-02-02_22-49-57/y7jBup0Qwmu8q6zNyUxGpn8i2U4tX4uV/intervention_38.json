He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The answer should be either A or B, but first, I need to understand the nuances.\n\nThe sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son vegan since birth. The author (the aunt/uncle) is a parent to another child who attends the same school. They pick up both kids from school, and the nephew has snacks and dinner at their house every weekday. The aunt makes a separate vegan dish for the nephew. However, the nephew and her son have been sharing chicken nuggets, which the nephew eats even though they aren't vegan. The nephew mentioned he eats meat sometimes at school, and the author hasn't told the sister yet. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old, which is a child. Parents typically have the right to make dietary choices for their children, especially when it's based on ethical beliefs. The sister is the one who made the decision to raise her son vegan, so she might feel that others should respect that by not exposing him to non-vegan food. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing them; the nephew is choosing to eat the meat. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by allowing the nephew to have meat when it's against the sister's wishes.\n\nBut the author isn't making the nephew eat meat; they're not forcing it. The nephew is making the choice on his own. The author is providing both options, which might be seen as a way to respect the nephew's autonomy. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister. The husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling, but the author isn't lying\u2014just not disclosing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the sister's beliefs are about not using animal products for ethical reasons. The author is in a position where they are in charge of the nephew's care during certain times, but ultimately, the responsibility for his diet lies with the sister as the parent. The child's choice to eat meat might be part of the situation, but the author is facilitating that choice by providing non-vegan options. So, the sister might feel that the author isn't respecting her values. On the other hand, the nephew is old enough to have some autonomy, and the author is allowing him to explore his preferences. The line here is between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child to make choices. \n\nLegally, the author might not be in the wrong if the nephew is choosing to eat the meat, but ethically, it's more about the parent's right to raise the child according to their beliefs. The author isn't forcing the child to eat non-vegan food, but they are providing it. The sister's reaction could be based on the belief that the child should not be exposed to meat at all, even if he's choosing to eat it. So, the author's decision not to inform the sister might be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting the parent's wishes. However, if the author is just allowing the child's natural curiosity and not actively encouraging it, maybe that's different.\n\nAnother angle is the school's role. The nephew is already exposed to meat at school, so maybe the author's situation isn't as bad. But the sister might not be aware of the school's practices. The author's choice to not tell the sister could be considered withholding information, which might be seen as dishonest. Alternatively, the author is trying to avoid conflict and respecting the nephew's autonomy.\n\nIn the end, the answer would depend on the sister's expectations and how the situation is perceived. If the sister believes that the author should never provide non-vegan food, then the author is in the wrong. If the sister expects the author to enforce the vegan diet strictly, then the author is not doing that. However, if the author is only providing options and the nephew is choosing, and the sister hasn't communicated that he can't eat meat at the author's house, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key is the sister's stance and whether the author's actions are interfering with her parenting.\n"
