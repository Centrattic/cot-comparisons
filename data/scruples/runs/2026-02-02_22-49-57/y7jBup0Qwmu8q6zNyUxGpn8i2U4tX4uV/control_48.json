He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the writer's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food they provide. The writer is conflicted about whether they should inform the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor. His mother has chosen a strict vegan diet for him, which she views as ethical. The writer, however, allows the nephew to eat meat when they provide both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew has been caught eating chicken nuggets, and the writer hasn't told his mother despite the sister being very strict about veganism.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are parental rights and the child's autonomy. The mother has a right to raise her child according to her beliefs, which includes dietary choices. By allowing the nephew to eat meat when she's not present, the writer might be undermining the mother's decisions. Even though the nephew is old enough to make some choices, he's still under 18, and his mother is legally responsible for his care and upbringing.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the writer's actions. They might believe they're giving the child a choice or that the child is curious about different foods. However, the mother's strict vegan stance suggests that she considers this diet essential, possibly for ethical reasons like animal welfare. Allowing the child to eat meat could conflict with those values. The writer's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not informing the sister, which adds another layer of internal conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Legally, the mother has the authority, so the writer might be overstepping by not adhering to her wishes. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. While the writer is respecting the child's autonomy to some extent, they're also not honoring the mother's decisions. The child might be influenced by his peers at school, but the writer's home should align with the mother's rules to maintain consistency.\n\nAlso, the writer's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a lack of transparency, especially if the sister would be upset. Trust in family relationships is important, and withholding such information might harm that trust. However, the writer's reasoning is that they want to respect the child's choices, but the mother's authority is primary here.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the mother's dietary decisions for her child. Even if the nephew is choosing the non-vegan option, the mother's wishes should take precedence in her child's upbringing. The writer's actions, though perhaps well-intentioned, could be seen as undermining the mother's authority and ethical beliefs.\n"
