He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeding meat to their nephew who is raised as a vegan by his mother. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author provides vegan meals but allows him to eat meat when he chooses, knowing his mother would be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is a staunch vegan and has been raising her son that way since birth. The nephew is eating meat at school when friends share with him, and now at the author's home too. The author isn't telling the sister, which the husband thinks is dishonest. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but the sister's beliefs are strong on this issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister. On one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy, allowing him to choose between the meals provided. On the other hand, the author might be violating the mother's trust by not discussing this with her, especially if she's unaware that her son is eating meat when with the author. \n\nBut the nephew is 10, so maybe the mother still has a say in his diet. The author's husband thinks they are in the wrong for being dishonest, which suggests a conflict within the household. The author could be seen as keeping a secret that might affect the mother's views on her parenting choices. However, the nephew might also be exploring his preferences, and the mother might not be completely strict if he's already getting meat at school. \n\nI need to weigh the sister's right to know against the nephew's autonomy. If the author doesn't mention it, the sister is being kept in the dark about her child's actual eating habits. But if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe the author is just respecting that. However, since the author is acting as a caregiver during the day, there's a responsibility to communicate with the parents about their child's well-being, including diet. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they are withholding information that the mother has a right to know. Even if the nephew is making choices, the mother might want to address it. Alternatively, the author is protecting the nephew's autonomy. But since the author isn't the parent, they might not have the authority to make that decision. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not informing the mother, which is a breach of trust. However, if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But the mother has a right to know her child's diet, especially if it contradicts her values. So the author's decision to keep it secret could be seen as dishonest, making them at fault.\n"
