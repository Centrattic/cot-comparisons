He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a vegan and raises her son vegan. The nephew is at the author's house after school, getting vegan snacks, but sometimes shares non-vegan food with the author's son. The author didn't tell the sister about this.\n\nSo, the author is in the middle of respecting their sister's beliefs and the nephew's autonomy. The nephew is 10 years old, so the question is whether he should be allowed to make his own dietary choices. The author's husband thinks they are at fault for not telling the sister and being dishonest. But the author is considering the child's freedom and the sister's strict stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's parenting choices. She's raising her son vegan, which she's done since birth. The author provides vegan options but the nephew sometimes chooses the meat. The author didn't stop him, maybe because they think the child should have some autonomy. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting, especially if she's very strict about it.\n\nThe nephew is 10, which is a child still in elementary school. At that age, most children rely on their parents for their diet. The sister might believe that the author is enabling the child to eat against what she's taught him. Even if the child is curious about meat, the author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as hiding the truth from a parent. However, the author might argue that they respect the child's choice and don't want to interfere with their sister's parenting unless there's a problem.\n\nBut from another angle, the author is in a position where they are responsible for the child's care during the after-school hours. The sister might expect the author to enforce the vegan diet unless she gives permission otherwise. The author's choice to not inform her could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author might think that the child is old enough to explore, and the sister's strictness could be harmful to the child's autonomy.\n\nI need to consider if there's a legal or ethical obligation here. Legally, unless the sister has given specific instructions not to feed the child non-vegan food, the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's more about respecting the parent's wishes. The author is in a tricky position because they want to respect both the sister's beliefs and the child's autonomy. But maybe the sister's wishes are more important here since she's the parent, and the child's choices are limited by the parent's rules. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister expects strict adherence to the vegan diet and the child is being given non-vegan food without her knowledge, the author could be seen as going against the parent's wishes. However, if the author believes that the child should have some autonomy and the sister's strictness is too rigid, there's a moral argument there too. \n\nIn the end, the key points are the age of the child, the strictness of the parent, and whether the author should have informed the sister. Since the child is under 10, his dietary choices are usually controlled by his parents. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to choose meat, especially since the parent might not be aware. So maybe the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without her consent.\n"
