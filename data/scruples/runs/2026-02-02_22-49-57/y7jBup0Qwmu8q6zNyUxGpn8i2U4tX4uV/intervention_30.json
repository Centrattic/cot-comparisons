He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raising her son that way, but the nephew is eating meat when at the author's house. The author makes vegan options but the nephew chooses the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. First, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, kids are starting to make their own choices, but they're still children. The sister's beliefs are strong, so she might be upset if she knew. The author isn't forcing the vegan food; they offer it but don't force the nephew to eat it. The nephew is choosing on his own. The author's reasoning is that the nephew should have the choice, especially since he's not getting meat at home. But the sister might see it as undermining her parenting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't intentionally hiding it. They didn't tell the sister, but maybe they thought it was better not to interfere. The sister might have strict rules, so the author might be respecting her parenting style by not intervening. However, the husband is concerned about honesty. Is the author being dishonest by not telling the sister? Or is it respecting the child's autonomy?\n\nI think the key points are: the nephew is making his own choices, the author isn't forcing the vegan food, and the sister's beliefs are important. The author's approach could be seen as allowing the child to explore his preferences, which is a common parenting approach. However, the sister might see it as going against her values. But since the author isn't making the child eat meat, just allowing him to choose when they're not present, it's a gray area. The answer would depend on whether respecting the child's choice outweighs the sister's expectations. Since the author isn't causing harm and is providing vegan options, maybe they're not in the wrong. So, B.\n"
