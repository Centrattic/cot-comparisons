He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The context provided is that the nephew is 10 years old, raised vegan by his mother, and the author has been giving him vegan snacks but he often chooses the non-vegan options. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author's husband thinks they should have told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the nephew. At 10, he's a child, so his dietary choices might not be entirely his own. His mom is the one enforcing veganism, and he's in a school setting where friends share food. The author is in a position where they're providing meals, but the nephew is choosing the meat. The key issue here is whether the author is violating the mother's wishes by not correcting the child's behavior or informing her.\n\nThe author argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but since he's a minor, his dietary decisions are still under parental control. The mother expects the author to uphold the vegan diet as part of their care. By not intervening when the nephew eats meat, the author might be undermining the mother's parenting. Additionally, the author's husband feels it's dishonest not to inform the sister, which adds another layer of consideration about transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be influenced by his peers, and the author is allowing him to make choices, respecting his autonomy. However, the author is in a role of responsibility when caring for another person's child, and they have an obligation to follow the parent's instructions unless there's a valid reason not to. By providing non-vegan options, even if the child chooses them, the author is creating a situation where the child can access meat, which the parent explicitly wants to avoid.\n\nSo, the conflict is between the author's belief in the child's autonomy and the parent's dietary rules. The parent has entrusted the care of the child's diet, and the author is not adhering to that trust. Even if the child is making his own choices, the author's provision of meat options could be seen as facilitating a choice the parent doesn't want. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's wishes and for not informing her, which could break trust if discovered another way.\n"
