He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is being raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan snacks. The author makes vegan options but the nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks they should tell the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about autonomy versus parental authority. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a common age where kids start making more choices, but he's still a child. The mother is strict about the vegan diet, so she might be upset if she finds out. The author isn't forcing him to eat vegan; they're providing options. The nephew is choosing to eat non-vegan food, possibly influenced by his friends at school.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they respect the mother's beliefs but also think the child should have some autonomy. However, the mother is the one making dietary decisions for her child, so the author's actions might conflict with that. The question is whether the author is interfering with the parents' decisions.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's health and diet. If the author is providing non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge, even if the child chooses it, it could be seen as going against the parents' wishes. On the other hand, the child is showing an interest in trying different foods, and the author might be giving him a chance to explore his preferences, which is important for development.\n\nBut the mother's stance is strict veganism for ethical reasons, so she might see this as a breach of trust or undermining her parenting. The author might be in a gray area here. They are respecting the child's choices in the moment but not informing the parent, which could be seen as dishonesty, especially if the parent would be upset. The husband's concern is about honesty, which is a valid point.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are not forcing the child to eat meat, but they are allowing it without informing the parent. The mother might feel that the author is not respecting her parenting decisions. However, the author could argue that the child is making his own choices. But since the child is under the mother's care, the author might have a duty to inform her, especially if it's a significant issue. Therefore, the answer might be AITA for the author because they are withholding information that the parent might consider important, even if the child is choosing the non-vegan food on his own.\n"
