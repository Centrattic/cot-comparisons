He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a vegan nephew who's being raised by a staunchly vegan mother. The aunt, who's the author, provides both vegan and non-vegan meals for her nephew and her own son when picking them up from school. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author makes a vegan option. The nephew mentions he eats meat at school sometimes with friends. The author hasn't told her sister, but her husband thinks she's in the wrong for not being honest. The author believes the 10-year-old is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The sister is strict about veganism, so the author's actions might be going against her sister's parenting decisions. But the nephew is 10, which is a young age, but maybe old enough to understand basic dietary choices. However, the mother has a right to raise her child according to her values. The question is whether the aunt is overstepping by not informing the mother about the nephew consuming meat.\n\nThe author is making vegan options, so she's respecting the sister's wishes, but by allowing the nephew to choose otherwise, she's enabling a deviation from the mother's plan. The sister might not be aware of the exposure her son is getting to non-vegan food, which could conflict with her ethical beliefs. The husband's perspective is that the author is dishonest for not telling the sister, which adds a layer of potential deception.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be considerate by offering both options and letting the child choose, possibly out of kindness or understanding that the child might be curious or influenced by peers. On the other hand, the mother's dietary rules for her child are part of her parenting, and the aunt's silence could be seen as undermining that. The author might be in a position of responsibility (since she's in charge of the kids during the time they're at her house) and thus has a duty to adhere to the parents' guidelines.\n\nThe key points are: respecting the mother's parenting choices, the aunt's responsibility in her care, and the child's autonomy. The aunt might not be in the wrong if her actions are within the bounds of allowing the child to explore, but if she's actively providing non-vegan options without the mother's consent, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might have expected the aunt to strictly follow the vegan diet as per her own parenting. The author's husband's argument is about honesty, which is a factor. So, the author's decision not to inform the sister might be considered dishonest and thus in the wrong. Alternatively, the aunt could be seen as giving the child some autonomy, but in a situation where the parents have set strict dietary rules, that autonomy might not be the aunt's to grant.\n"
