He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is vegan, raising her son that way since birth. The author provides vegan options but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author didn't tell the sister, even though the sister would be upset. The husband thinks the author is wrong for not telling, but the author believes the nephew should decide his diet since he's 10.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister has a strong ethical stance on veganism, so she might feel violated if her son is eating meat elsewhere. However, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some argue children aren't fully capable of making their own dietary choices, especially if they're not aware of the ethical reasons. But others might say that the child is old enough to make some choices, and the author's approach is allowing him to explore.\n\nThe author is providing vegan options, so they're respecting the sister's wishes, but not enforcing them strictly. The nephew is choosing otherwise, which the author allows. The key point here is whether the author has an obligation to inform the sister. If the author is acting as a caregiver, maybe they should inform the parent. But if they're just a relative, maybe not. The sister might not have given permission for the author to control the nephew's diet entirely, so the author's actions could be seen as overstepping or not.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. If the nephew is eating meat because his friends do, maybe it's a social aspect. But if the mother's ethical beliefs are strong, she might feel that the author is undermining her parenting. On the other hand, the author is trying to be respectful by offering vegan options and not pushing the issue.\n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're allowing the child some autonomy and providing vegan options. However, they might be in the wrong if they have a responsibility to inform the parent about the child's diet, especially since the mother's beliefs are so strong. But since the author is a relative and not the primary caregiver, maybe their duty is less. The child is old enough to make some choices, so the author's hands-off approach after providing options could be justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
