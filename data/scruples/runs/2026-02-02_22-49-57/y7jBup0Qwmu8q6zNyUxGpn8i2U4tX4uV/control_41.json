He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising the nephew strictly vegan, and the author provides both a regular meal and a vegan one. The nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food sometimes, and the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' authority. The sister is the one raising the kid vegan, so she's making dietary decisions for him. The nephew is 10, so maybe the author thinks he's old enough to choose, but at that age, parents usually make big decisions for their kids, especially regarding diet. Feeding a child something against their parents' wishes could be seen as going against their authority. \n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The sister is \"staunchly vegan\" for ethical reasons. The author is allowing the nephew to eat meat, which contradicts those beliefs. The sister might feel betrayed if she found out. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for being dishonest. So there's a conflict between respecting the sister's wishes and letting the kid choose. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make some choices, but diet is a big one, especially when it's about parental guidelines. The author might be trying to be lenient, but the parents' rules are clear. The key point is whether the author should inform the sister. If the author is a parent figure, there's a duty to inform the actual parents. \n\nSo, the answer might be A because the author is not respecting the parents' decisions and is keeping it a secret, which is dishonest. The nephew's autonomy is limited by his age and the parents' authority. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the kid to eat meat against her wishes.\n"
