He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old nephew vegan since birth. The nephew and the author's son go to the same school, and the author picks them up. The nephew has snacks and dinner at the author's house each weekday before his mom picks him up. The author usually makes separate meals: one for their family and a vegan one for the nephew. But one day, the author left them with homework and snacks, did chores, came back, and found the nephew and the son sharing chicken nuggets. The nephew ate the non-vegan option even though the author provided vegan snacks. The nephew mentioned he sometimes eats meat at school, and friends share food. The author didn't tell the sister and continues to offer vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew if he chooses the non-vegan one. The sister is very strict about being vegan, and the author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister is strict vegan, the nephew is 10, the author is providing vegan options but the nephew eats the non-vegan ones, and the author hasn't told the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing her sister.\n\nHmm. The author is respecting their sister's wishes by providing vegan meals but not enforcing them when the nephew chooses otherwise. The nephew is old enough to have some autonomy. The sister might be upset if she knew, but the author is trying to let the child make his own choices. On the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister to see her preferences. But the author is in a position of trust, maybe as a caregiver. If the sister is the one responsible for the child's diet, the author's actions could be seen as undermining that authority. However, since the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, and the author is not forcing it, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's husband thinks it's in the wrong, but the author doesn't. The question is whether the author is violating the sister's trust by not telling her. But the author might be respecting the child's autonomy. So, it's not entirely clear. However, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're allowing the child to make his own choices and not forcing veganism. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
