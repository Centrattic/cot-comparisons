He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person who feeds their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and the nephew is raised vegan since birth. The author provides vegan snacks but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan ones, like chicken nuggets. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister has clear ethical beliefs, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is a young age, but the author argues he's making his own choices. However, the nephew might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism, especially if he's just trying to fit in with friends. \n\nIs providing non-vegan options a breach of the sister's wishes? The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they offer vegan snacks but don't stop him from choosing the meat. The sister might see this as indirectly encouraging him to eat meat, which could conflict with her parenting choices. But on the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't actively lying. They're just not reporting the behavior to the sister.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nephew's autonomy. At 10, a child's autonomy is limited, and parents usually have the authority over their children's diets. The sister is the parent, so she might believe that the author is undermining her parenting by allowing the nephew to eat meat. However, the author isn't forcing it. It's a matter of whether the author should inform the sister or not.\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for being dishonest. But the author isn't hiding anything from the sister; they're just not informing her about their son's choices. The nephew is making choices outside of the sister's home environment. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting the nephew's autonomy and not actively promoting meat-eating. However, the sister might see this as a violation of their agreement or expectations when the nephew is in their care.\n\nBut the author is also providing vegan options, so they aren't promoting meat. It's more about the nephew's own preferences. The sister's reaction could be based on the belief that she's the authority on her child's diet, and the author's silence might be seen as complicity in the child not adhering to vegan principles. However, the author isn't lying; they're just not disclosing the nephew's choices. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky gray area. If the author had made the meat for the nephew, maybe. But since the nephew is choosing on his own, it's more about the author's decision to not inform the parent. The ethical standpoint here might depend on cultural norms and family agreements. The author might not be in the wrong, but they could be in a position where transparency is needed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they're not actively violating any agreement or forcing the meat, but potentially undermining the sister's parenting, but the nephew is making his own choices. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
