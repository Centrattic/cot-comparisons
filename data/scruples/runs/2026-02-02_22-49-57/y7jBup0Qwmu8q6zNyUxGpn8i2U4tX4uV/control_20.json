He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The nephew is 10 years old and has been vegan since birth, as per his mother's strict vegan principles. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew often chooses the non-vegan one, possibly because he's exposed to meat at school. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about autonomy versus parental authority. The sister raised her son to be vegan, which is a personal ethical choice. The nephew is making choices outside the home, maybe influenced by friends, and the author is feeding him non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge. \n\nIs the author respecting the parent's wishes? By not telling the sister, they're allowing the child to deviate from the vegan diet she's enforcing. The mother might feel betrayed if she finds out, both because the child is eating meat and that the author didn't inform her. On the other hand, the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making their own decisions, but parents typically still have authority over their children's diet.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the mother's rules are about what he eats. Since the author is the one in charge of his meals at their home, there's a conflict between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. The sister's strictness about veganism is a big part of this. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, which suggests that transparency is important here.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge, which might go against her wishes. Even if the nephew is choosing, the mother's rules are in place, and the author should communicate to maintain trust. So the answer would be A.\n"
