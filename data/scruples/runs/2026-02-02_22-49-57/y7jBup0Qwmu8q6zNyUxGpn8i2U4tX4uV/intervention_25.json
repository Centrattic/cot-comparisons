He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mother, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan snacks. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses the meat. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the 10-year-old should be allowed to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is strict about veganism, which is her ethical choice. The nephew is 10, so he's a minor, and his parents are making dietary decisions for him. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, which includes dietary choices. However, the nephew is at the author's house, and the author is providing food. The author is giving vegan options but allowing the child to choose otherwise. \n\nIs there an obligation for the author to inform the sister? The author is the child's aunt, so maybe there's a familial duty to respect the sister's wishes. But the child is old enough to make his own choices, but he's still a child. Maybe the parents have the final say in dietary decisions. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat; they're just not preventing him from choosing the non-vegan option. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the nephew might be curious or influenced by friends. But the sister's perspective would be that the author is undermining her parenting. On the other hand, the author is allowing the child to explore his preferences, which could be seen as supporting his autonomy. \n\nLegally, parents have the authority to decide their child's diet. The author isn't feeding the child meat against the parent's wishes; they're giving him the choice. However, if the author knew the child was eating non-vegan food and didn't inform the parent, maybe that's a breach of trust. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. Since the child is 10, it's a gray area. The author isn't actively encouraging the child to eat meat but is allowing it. The sister might feel violated if she finds out, but the author isn't acting maliciously. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whose perspective you take. If we prioritize the parent's authority, then the author should inform them. If we prioritize the child's autonomy and the author's right to provide options, then they might not be in the wrong. The author is not forcing the child to eat meat, just providing the option. The sister's strictness might mean that the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as disregarding her parenting choices. \n\nBut the author isn't the one making him eat the meat; the child is choosing. So maybe the author isn't responsible for the child's choices once the options are given. The ethical dilemma here is between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they're not forcing the child to eat meat and are providing vegan options. However, there's an argument that they should inform the sister to respect her wishes. But since the author isn't actively violating the sister's rules by providing non-vegan food, just allowing the child to choose, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
