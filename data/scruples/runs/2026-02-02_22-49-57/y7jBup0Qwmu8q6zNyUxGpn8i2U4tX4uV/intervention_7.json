He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is vegan since birth, but when he's at the author's house, he often eats the non-vegan options provided, like chicken nuggets. The author doesn't tell the sister about this and their husband thinks they are in the wrong for being dishonest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The sister has strong ethical beliefs about her child's diet, so the author not informing her could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the nephew is 10 years old and might be making his own choices, especially if he's exposed to non-vegan food at school. The author is providing vegan options but the child is choosing otherwise. \n\nThe key points are: the nephew is old enough to make his own choices? At 10, maybe the parents should have some say, but the child is in the author's care temporarily. The author's responsibility is to the child's well-being. However, the parents have specific dietary rules they want enforced. \n\nIs the author being dishonest? They aren't actively lying, just not reporting that the child sometimes eats non-vegan food. If the sister provided specific instructions, then the author might be in the wrong for not following them. But the question says the author makes a vegan dish each time, which suggests they are making an effort. The nephew chooses the meat on his own, which might not be the author's fault. \n\nBut the parents might not have given permission for the child to have meat when not in their presence. The author's decision to keep it a secret could undermine the parents' authority and beliefs. The husband's perspective is that they should be honest and not hide the child's actions. \n\nHowever, the nephew is in a school environment where he's already being exposed to meat through friends. The author's husband might think that the parents have the right to know, but the author might see this as the child exploring his choices. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author is acting as a caregiver, they might be expected to follow the parents' dietary instructions unless there's a health concern. The child's choice to eat meat might be against the parents' wishes, so the author's silence could be viewed as complicity. \n\nBut the author is providing vegan options, which is respectful. If the child is making independent choices, maybe that's a natural part of growing up. The parents might prefer to handle the situation themselves if they knew. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the child eating meat on his own, but the question is whether they should inform the sister. Choosing not to could be seen as being in the wrong if the sister's trust is important. However, the author might be trying to avoid conflict and respect the child's autonomy. \n\nHmm, the answer depends on the balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy. Since the author is making vegan options and the child is choosing otherwise, maybe they aren't actively encouraging the meat consumption. But the parents might not have agreed to that. The author's decision to not tell could be considered a breach of trust, making them in the wrong. But the husband's stance is that they are in the wrong for being dishonest. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents didn't specify that the child must strictly adhere to veganism even when with the author, then the author isn't wrong. But if they did, then the author is not following the parents' instructions. The question doesn't mention if the parents gave explicit rules about this. \n\nGiven that the sister is \"staunchly vegan\" and the author is providing vegan options, it's possible that the sister expects the child to stick to vegan food at all times. The author's silence could be seen as not fulfilling that expectation. However, the child is old enough to make his own decisions, and the parents might prefer to handle the situation when they know. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author is intentionally hiding the child's choices from the parents, that's dishonesty. But if they are simply not monitoring the child's choices and the parents didn't specify, maybe not. The fact that the author made a separate vegan dish shows they are making an effort, but the lack of communication is the issue. \n\nThe correct answer here might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are being dishonest by not informing the sister, even if the child is making the choice. However, some might argue B (No) because the child is making his own decisions. But in terms of the parents' wishes, the author's responsibility as a caregiver is to follow the parents' instructions. The author didn't get permission to allow the child to eat meat, so by not telling, they might be in the wrong.\n"
