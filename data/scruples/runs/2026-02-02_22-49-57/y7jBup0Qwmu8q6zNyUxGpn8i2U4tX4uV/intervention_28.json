He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who raises her son vegan. The nephew is 10 years old, and when he's at the author's house, they usually make separate meals. But the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though he's supposed to have the vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister about this, and their husband is upset because they think the author is being dishonest. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The sister is very strict about veganism, so if she found out, she might be upset. But the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by not correcting him when he chooses meat. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing the choice, which seems reasonable, especially since kids often go for the more tempting option.\n\nThe sister's rules are about how the nephew is raised, but when he's at the author's house, it's a different environment. The author isn't pushing meat on the kid; they're just not policing his choices. The nephew might be influenced by friends at school, so maybe he's experimenting. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy or avoiding conflict. However, the sister has a right to know if her child is not following her dietary rules when they think he is.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is respecting the nephew's choices and not pressuring him. Since the kid is old enough to make decisions, maybe it's his choice to some extent. But the sister might see this as going against her parenting. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, but the author feels it's the nephew's choice. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author has an obligation to inform the sister. If the author is the one providing the non-vegan food, maybe they are at fault. But in this case, the author is providing both options, and the nephew chooses the non-vegan. The author isn't forcing it, just allowing it. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't violating any rules directly. The nephew is making his own choices, which the author is respecting. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
