He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old and attends the same school as the author's son. The author provides vegan snacks and meals for the nephew but also makes non-vegan food for the rest of the family. The nephew sometimes shares the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister about it. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's strong ethical stance on veganism, the nephew's age and autonomy, and the author's decision not to inform the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for allowing the nephew to eat meat without telling the mother.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by allowing him to choose his food, which is a valid consideration for a 10-year-old. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they're providing vegan options but not stopping him from eating the non-vegan ones. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author isn't actively lying\u2014they're just not mentioning it. \n\nLegally, the parent has the right to make dietary choices for their child, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author is balancing between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the mother's wishes. Since the author is aware of the mother's strict veganism, there's an argument that they should inform her to avoid deception. However, the author might also believe that the child should have some freedom, especially if the mother isn't aware of the school sharing.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, it's common to respect a parent's wishes unless there's a risk of harm. Since the mother's concern is ethical and not related to health, the author's actions aren't causing harm. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not telling, but the situation is complex. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they\u2019re respecting the child's choices and not actively violating any laws or the mother's explicit instructions. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
