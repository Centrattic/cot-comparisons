He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe scenario is about a person whose vegan sister is raising her son vegan since birth. The author sometimes feeds their nephew vegan food, but the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest. The author is unsure if they should tell the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew when he chooses meat. The husband thinks they should tell the sister, but the author feels the nephew should have autonomy.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister about the nephew eating meat. The sister's beliefs are important here. If the author were to tell, it could cause conflict. However, the nephew's autonomy is also a factor. The author isn't forcing the vegan food on the nephew but is still providing options, respecting his choice.\n\nI need to think about ethical considerations. The sister's ethical stance is about veganism, but the nephew is 10 and starting to explore his own choices. The author isn't encouraging him to eat meat; they're just not intervening. That seems like a middle ground. However, the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author didn't lie\u2014just didn't disclose something.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the author. Are they supposed to inform the sister about their child's actions outside of home? The nephew does eat meat at school too, so the author isn't the only influence. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't directly causing harm. The nephew is making his own choices, which is part of growing up.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on respecting others' beliefs while considering all parties. The author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan food but also allowing the nephew to choose. The sister's reaction could be extreme, but the author isn't forcing anything. The husband's concern is about honesty, but the author isn't lying; they're just not informing. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B).\n"
