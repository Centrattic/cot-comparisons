He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a nephew who's raised vegan but ends up eating meat when at his uncle's house. The uncle provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew from eating non-vegan food when he chooses to. The sister is very strict about her child being vegan, and the husband thinks the uncle is being dishonest by not telling her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor. The parents have certain dietary values they enforce at home. The uncle is in a position where he's responsible for the child during pickups and dinners. He's making separate meals, but the child sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The uncle hasn't told the mother about this, and the husband thinks he should have. The uncle justifies it by saying the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, the question is whether the uncle is in the wrong. The sister's values are about ethical eating, so she might be upset if she knew. The uncle is respecting her wishes by making vegan meals, but allowing the child to choose otherwise. However, when a parent entrusts someone else with their child, there's an expectation that the child's care aligns with the parents' guidelines. The uncle isn't enforcing the vegan diet but isn't actively opposing it either. But by not informing the mother, there's a possible breach of trust. \n\nChildren at 10 might start asserting independence, but they still rely on adults to make decisions for them, especially regarding health and diet. The uncle's actions might be seen as deceptive because he's not keeping the mother informed about her child's diet when it's inconsistent with what she arranged. On the other hand, the uncle could argue that the mother's strictness might cause the child to hide his preferences, and allowing some autonomy could be beneficial. However, the mother has the right to know about her child's diet during the time he's in someone else's care. \n\nThe uncle's decision to not tell the sister could be seen as a violation of the trust the parents placed in him. Even if he respects her beliefs, the parents have the authority to decide what's best for their child. The uncle's role might be to follow the parents' instructions unless there's a compelling reason to deviate. Since the mother is unaware of the situation, the uncle isn't being transparent, which could be considered dishonest. The husband's perspective is that he's being dishonest, which aligns with that reasoning.\n\nOn the flip side, the uncle is providing vegan options, which is in line with the mother's wishes, and the child is making his own choices. If the mother had known, she might have adjusted her approach. However, the key issue here is the communication. The uncle didn't inform the mother, even though the child's diet during his care is part of the parents' expectations. So, the uncle's non-disclosure might be the problem, not necessarily allowing the child to eat meat. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, parents entrust others to care for their children as per their guidelines. If those guidelines are not being followed, the caregiver should communicate that. The uncle's silence could be seen as a failure to uphold that trust. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA, the author being in the wrong for not informing the sister. But some might argue that the uncle is giving the child autonomy. However, in legal and ethical terms, minors' caregivers are supposed to adhere to the parents' decisions unless there's a conflict of interest. The uncle's actions don't involve overriding the parents' dietary choices but allowing the child to choose in their absence. But the non-disclosure is key here. \n\nSo, the uncle is in a position where he's responsible for the child's care and should communicate any deviations from the parents' wishes. Not doing so could be seen as deceitful, even if well-intentioned. Therefore, the answer is likely AITA (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't inform the mother about the child's diet during her care, which is the mother's right to know.\n"
