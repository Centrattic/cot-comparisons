He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding meat to their vegan nephew without telling the mother. \n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10, so he's a minor, and the author is providing him with non-vegan food when his mother isn't around. The key points here are the mother's beliefs, the child's autonomy, and the potential conflict between respecting parental wishes and allowing a child's choices.\n\nThe author makes vegan meals but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan options. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's already exposed to it there. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks they should. The author believes the nephew is old enough to choose his diet.\n\nOn one hand, the mother has entrusted the author with her son's care during pick-up times, and expecting the child to follow the vegan diet is part of that trust. Introducing meat without the mother's knowledge might breach that trust, even if the child is making his own choices. The mother's ethical stance is strong, so she might feel violated if she finds out. \n\nOn the other hand, the child is 10 and might be exploring his preferences. The author is providing options, which is good, but the mother's rules are clear. The author is in a position where they should follow the parent's instructions unless the child is in danger, which isn't the case here. \n\nThe dilemma here is between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child autonomy. Legally and ethically, parents have the right to dictate their child's diet unless there's harm. Since the author isn't causing harm but is acting against the parent's explicit wishes, that could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adhering to the mother's dietary rules for her child without her knowledge. The child might be old enough to make choices, but the parent's instructions should take precedence unless there's a conflict of rights, which isn't clearly present here. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not following the parent's explicit wishes, even if they have good intentions.\n"
