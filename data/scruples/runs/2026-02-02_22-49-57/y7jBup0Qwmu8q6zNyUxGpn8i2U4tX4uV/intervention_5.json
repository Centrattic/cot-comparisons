He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising the nephew as vegan since birth, and the author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old. The author makes vegan food but also has regular food. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan option, even though he was told about it. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author is hiding this from her.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister. The husband thinks they are in the wrong for being dishonest. The author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nSo, from a legal or moral standpoint, the sister is raising her child vegan, which is her right. However, the nephew is 10, which is an age where they might start exploring their own preferences. The author isn't forcing the vegan food; they offer it. The nephew is choosing to eat the meat, which could be seen as his choice. But does the author have a responsibility to inform the mother, especially since she's strict about veganism?\n\nBut the author isn't providing meat specifically for him; they just have their own family's meals. The nephew is taking from the non-vegan options. The author isn't encouraging the meat-eating but isn't stopping it either. The sister would be upset if she knew, but the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. However, the parent has the right to raise their child according to their beliefs, but the child, being 10, might be forming his own preferences. The author isn't lying directly; they're just not informing the mother. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being deceptive. If the nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, is the author complicit by not stopping him? But the author isn't serving the meat to him; it's the nephew's choice. The author is providing vegan options, which is what the mother expects. The mother might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author is also respecting the nephew's autonomy. \n\nIn many cultures, parents have the authority to make decisions about their children's diets. However, the child is old enough to have some say in their preferences. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy and not imposing the strict vegan diet. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're allowing the nephew to explore his choices without forcing him. The mother's strict veganism is her right, but the child is making his own choices. The author isn't actively feeding the nephew meat but is allowing the situation to happen. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
