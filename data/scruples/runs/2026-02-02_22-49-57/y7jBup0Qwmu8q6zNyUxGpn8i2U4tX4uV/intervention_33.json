He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author has a vegan sister who raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew and the author's son go to the same school, and the author picks them up daily. The author usually makes separate meals\u2014one for the family and a vegan one for the nephew. But one day, the author left and came back to find the nephew and her son sharing chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat sometimes at school, and the author hasn't told the sister yet.\n\nThe author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not being honest, but she believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The sister is very strict about veganism for ethical reasons. The question is whether the author is at fault for feeding the nephew meat or not informing the sister.\n\nFirst, the author is providing vegan options, which shows she's respecting the sister's wishes. The nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan option, maybe because he doesn't get meat at home. The author didn't intentionally feed him meat; it was a situation where the kids shared. The author didn't correct the nephew immediately and just continued offering vegan snacks. \n\nThe sister might not approve, but the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew. The nephew is 10, so some might argue he's still a child and his parents' choices should guide his diet. However, the author might be trying to be lenient, allowing the nephew to make his own choices, which could be seen as respecting his autonomy. On the other hand, the sister's strictness about veganism is based on ethical beliefs, so the author might be compromising that by not enforcing it.\n\nBut the key points are: the author provided vegan options, the nephew chose otherwise, and the author didn't actively encourage it. The sister hasn't been informed, which the husband objects to. However, the nephew's own actions (eating meat at school) suggest he's already making his own choices outside the author's home. The author's decision not to tell the sister could be seen as protecting the nephew's autonomy or possibly being dishonest. But since the author isn't forcing the meat, maybe it's not her fault. It's a balance between respecting the sister's wishes and the nephew's growing independence. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
