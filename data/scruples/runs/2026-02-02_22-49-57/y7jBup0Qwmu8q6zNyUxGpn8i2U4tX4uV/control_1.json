He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a vegan and raising her son that way. The nephew eats meat when he's at the author's house, even though vegan options are provided.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a child. His mother is strict about veganism, and the author is providing non-vegan food despite knowing this. The nephew is choosing the meat, but the author isn't informing the mother. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to decide for himself.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author has a duty to inform the mother. The mother is the one making the dietary decisions for the child, as he's a minor. Even if the child is choosing meat on his own, the mother has the right to know what's happening when her son is under others' care. The author is in a position of responsibility for the child's well-being during the time they have him. Not disclosing this could be seen as withholding important information that affects the child's diet, which the mother has explicitly requested to avoid.\n\nAdditionally, the mother's ethical beliefs are strong here. If she found out, she might feel the author is undermining her parenting choices. Even if the child is making choices, the author's role is to follow the mother's guidelines when caring for her child. Allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against the mother's wishes might breach that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the child is old enough to make his own choices. However, at 10 years old, a child's choices are still influenced by their parents, and the parents have the authority to set boundaries. The author's duty is to the parents when the child is in their care. Therefore, not informing the mother is a breach of that duty, making the author in the wrong.\n"
