He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. So, the author's sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10, and the author takes care of him after school, providing vegan snacks and meals. But the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author makes vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister, and now the husband is upset, but the author thinks the nephew should have the choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, including dietary choices. However, as the child gets older, they might start making their own decisions. At age 10, in some places, children can make certain choices, but others might argue that parents' rights still take precedence.\n\nEthically, the sister is strict about her veganism for ethical reasons. The author is respecting that by providing vegan options but not forcing the nephew to eat them. If the nephew is choosing to eat meat when given the option, is that the author's fault? The author didn't force him, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, even if the nephew made the choice. The author is in a middle ground, not interfering but also not reporting the sister.\n\nAnother angle: the author is providing the vegan food as required, but the child is making his own choices. The author isn't encouraging the meat-eating but isn't stopping it either. The sister might argue that the author is enabling the child to stray from their family's values. But the author could argue autonomy and the child's right to choose, especially if the sister is aware that the child sometimes eats meat at school.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author might feel it's a private matter between the nephew and the sister. The key here is whether the author has a duty to inform the sister. Since the author isn't the parent, maybe they don't have that responsibility. The nephew is old enough to make choices, so the author isn't wrong for allowing him to choose, even if it's against the mother's wishes. The author isn't forcing the meat; they're just not preventing the child from eating it if he chooses. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're respecting the child's autonomy within the framework of providing the options the parent requested. The sister might be upset, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
