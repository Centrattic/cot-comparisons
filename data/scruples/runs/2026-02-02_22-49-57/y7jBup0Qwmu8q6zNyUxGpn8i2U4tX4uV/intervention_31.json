He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. So the situation is that the sister is vegan and raises her son vegan. The author, who has their own child in the same school, picks up both and provides snacks and dinner. They usually make a vegan dish for the nephew but also make non-vegan food for their own family. One day, the nephew and the son shared chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat sometimes at school, so the author didn't mention it to his mom but keeps providing vegan options. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but they think the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. The sister is strict about veganism, so if the nephew is eating meat, she might be upset. But the nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The author is respecting his choice by not interfering beyond providing vegan options. The sister might not approve, but the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew. They just allow him to eat the non-vegan food if he chooses. \n\nBut the sister's beliefs are important. The author could argue they're not forcing him to eat it, just giving him options. However, the sister might feel that by not informing her, the author is being dishonest. On the other hand, the nephew is making the choice himself, so maybe it's his autonomy. The author isn't encouraging him to eat meat; they're just not stopping him. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the author violate the sister's wishes by not informing her? Or is it about respecting the nephew's autonomy? The sister might feel betrayed, but if the nephew is making his own choices, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not stopping him. The author is still providing vegan options, so it's about whether they should have disclosed. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're allowing the nephew to choose, and the sister's beliefs are important, but the nephew is old enough to make decisions. However, there's a balance between respecting parental wishes and a child's autonomy. But since the author isn't forcing the meat, they might be in the right. So answer B.\n"
