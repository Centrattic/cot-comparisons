His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a mother who started dating her son's friend. The son, Ben, is 21, and the mother is 38. She's been a single mom since Ben was 17. Ben had a band, and she met Joe, a colleague, who joined the band. They started talking, and eventually, they began texting and developing a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and son have a close relationship since she was a single mom for most of Ben's life. Now, Ben is an adult, 21, so he's legally an adult and presumably living on his own, but maybe they still have a very close bond. The mother is 38, so she's in her late 30s. The guy she's dating is 29, so seven years younger than her. Wait, Joe is 29, the mother is 38? Wait, the mother is 38, Ben is 21. Wait, that means the mother is 17 when she had Ben. So, she's 38 now. Joe is 29. So, the mother is 38 and Joe is 29. So, there's a 9-year age difference between Ben and Joe. Ben is 21, Joe is 29.\n\nNow, the mother met Joe through Ben's band. Joe joined the band because the mother suggested it. She gave him Ben's number. Then, Joe became part of the band. The mother and Joe started talking more, and eventually, they started a relationship. Ben found out and got upset. The mother argues that it's different from dating someone Ben has known since middle school, like Matt. \n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Let's think. Legally, she's an adult, and Joe is an adult. There's no legal issue here. The problem is more about the social and emotional boundaries between a mother and her adult son. The mother might be overstepping if Ben feels uncomfortable. However, Ben is an adult, and technically, the mother is allowed to date someone. The issue here is the relationship between the mother and the son's friend. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since Ben is still in a close relationship with his mother and might not be comfortable with her dating his friend. \n\nBut Ben is 21, so he's an adult, and the mother is also an adult. The mother's decision to date someone is her right. However, the way she met Joe through the band, and the fact that Joe is a friend of Ben's, could complicate things. If Ben is upset, it's about his feelings. The mother's argument is that she's an adult and can date whoever she wants, but Ben might feel that his friend is being taken from him. \n\nIn some cases, mothers dating their son's friends can be seen as taking advantage of their influence over their son's social life. However, in this case, the mother didn't push Joe into the band; she just suggested it to Ben, and Joe joined on his own. The relationship between the mother and Joe developed after they met through the band. The mother didn't set it up for them to date, but their relationship happened naturally. \n\nThe key factors here are: the mother's age (38), Joe's age (29), Ben's age (21). Ben is an adult, so the mother's dating life is her choice. However, the social dynamics might make Ben feel uncomfortable. The mother might need to consider Ben's feelings, but she's not in the wrong legally or ethically. She's just navigating her own life and forming a relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the mother is in a position of authority at work, but Joe is a colleague. However, the workplace is separate from the band situation. The mother gave Joe Ben's number to join the band, not for personal reasons. The relationship started after that. \n\nSo, the mother is not in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date. However, she should be sensitive to her son's feelings, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
