His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me start by going through the details again.\n\nThe mother had her son Ben at 17, and his father wasn't around. Now Ben is 21 and dealing with depression, and she's been helping him with therapy. Ben is introverted and lonely. He was in a band before, which disbanded. The mother suggested starting a band again, made posters, and met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe ended up joining Ben's band. The mother and Joe started talking more, and eventually, they began dating. Ben found out and got upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the relationships here. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. Ben is 21. The mother is Ben's mother, and Joe is his friend. The dynamic here is that the mother is entering into a romantic relationship with her son's friend. Ben is an adult, so he's 21, but he's still her son. The mother is acting as a parent, but once the child becomes an adult, the parent's role changes in terms of personal relationships.\n\nNow, in terms of ethics, it's a bit tricky. The mother is dating someone who is friends with her adult son. The son is upset, but he's an adult as well. There's no legal issue here, as they're both adults. However, there's a potential for conflict of interest if Joe and the mother work in the same workplace. But the story mentions they work in different departments, so maybe that's not a huge problem unless they interact more closely.\n\nAnother angle is Ben's well-being. He's dealing with depression and loneliness, and the mother is trying to help him make friends. The band is part of that effort. Joe became part of the band, which helped Ben. Now, the mother is in a relationship with Joe. Ben might feel that his mother is taking someone who he considered a friend, which could make him feel like the mother is not respecting his social circle. However, Ben is an adult, so he should have some autonomy in his relationships, even if he's still close to his mother.\n\nThe mother's perspective is that she and Joe met through Ben's band, and their relationship started after some initial interactions. The mother feels like it's not the same as if she dated Ben's long-time friend Matt, but perhaps the comparison is just Ben's way of expressing his discomfort. The mother doesn't have a romantic history with Ben, so there's no prior relationship that's being usurped.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against an adult child's parent dating someone who is friends with the adult child. However, in terms of social norms, it might be considered awkward or inappropriate, depending on the cultural context. The mother might be in a position of authority or influence over Joe, especially if they work together, but the story says they are in different departments and only interacted through Ben's band initially.\n\nBen's reaction is valid because he's upset, but he's an adult and should have the right to form his own opinions and relationships. However, the mother's relationship could affect Ben's feelings. If the mother and Joe's relationship causes tension, it's something they need to navigate. The key here is whether the mother acted in bad faith. She introduced Joe to Ben's band through the flyer, which was a legitimate way to help Ben. The relationship between her and Joe developed naturally, not as a manipulation or to take someone from Ben.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's an adult acting on her own, and Ben is also an adult who needs to respect his mother's autonomy. The answer might be more nuanced, but in terms of right and wrong, the mother is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
