His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to understand all the details.\n\nSo, the woman had a son at 17, became a single mom. Now she's 38, and her son Ben is 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She encouraged him to start a band again. He made a flyer, and she posted it at work. Her colleague Joe, 29, saw the flyer, auditioned, and joined the band. Over time, they interacted more, and eventually, the woman started texting Joe a lot. Ben found out and got upset, saying it's weird and he can't date his friend. The mom argues it's different from dating Ben's friend since Joe is more of a bandmate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is Ben's primary caregiver, and their relationship is crucial. Ben's reaction is emotional, feeling that his mom is dating his friend. The main issue seems to be Ben's feelings of betrayal or discomfort, even if the mom didn't intend to cause harm.\n\nIn some cultures or contexts, a parent dating a friend of their adult child might be more accepted, but in others, it could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the child is still in a dependent role. However, Ben is 21, an adult, so technically, his mom isn't his legal guardian anymore. But their emotional bond might still be strong, and he might feel the relationship is a violation of boundaries.\n\nThe mom's actions: she met Joe through the band, which is a shared activity with her son. She might have felt a connection because she's been single for a long time. The concern is whether her relationship with Joe affects Ben's well-being. If Ben is still relying on her emotionally, this could create tension. However, Joe isn't Ben's best friend since middle school as the example given, but a bandmate. But Ben's comparison suggests he feels the same way about Joe as a close friend.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's intentions. She didn't set out to date Joe; it developed naturally from work and shared interests. But when Ben found out, the issue became about his feelings. The mom might not be in the wrong if she's an adult and free to date, but Ben's perspective is important. However, if the relationship makes Ben feel uncomfortable or affects their relationship, then the mom might need to consider that.\n\nAlso, the fact that Joe is her colleague adds another layer. There could be workplace-related issues if they start dating, though that's more about professional boundaries, but the question here is about her son's feelings.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the relationship is causing her son significant distress and she could reasonably see that, maybe she's overstepping. But if Ben is an adult and capable of handling his emotions, then maybe she's not. However, the mother's role as a parent often includes considering her child's feelings, even as adults. The answer might hinge on whether the mother's actions are respecting both her and her son's needs.\n\nIn some cases, it's about the perception. If Ben feels betrayed, the mother's actions could be seen as wrong from his perspective, even if she didn't mean to. But since the question is from the mother's point of view asking if she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) if she's an adult with the right to date, but A (Yes) if the relationship is causing harm to her son's well-being.\n\nBut given that Ben is 21 and the mother is 38, they're both adults. The mother's dating life is her own, but if Ben is still emotionally dependent, it's a gray area. The key is whether the mother is causing unnecessary harm. If Ben is upset and the mother is choosing her own happiness, but also considering her son's feelings, maybe the mother isn't in the wrong, but she should communicate and address Ben's concerns. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she should take steps to resolve it.\n\nI think the answer might be B (No), as the mother is an adult and can date, even if it's a friend of her adult son. But there's a possibility of A if the relationship is inappropriate because of the power dynamic or if it's affecting her son's mental health. However, given the son is 21 and the mother is acting on her own needs, it's more likely B.\n"
