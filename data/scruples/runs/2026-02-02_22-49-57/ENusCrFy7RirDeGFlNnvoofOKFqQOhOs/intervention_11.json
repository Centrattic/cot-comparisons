His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend, Joe. The situation starts with the mother being a single parent, and her son Ben being 21 with depression. The mother suggested starting a band, which led to Joe joining. They were colleagues, but not close. Then, when Ben was late, the mother invited Joe in for coffee, leading to more interaction and eventually a relationship forming. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a close friend since middle school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's intentions were initially to help her son by connecting him with Joe for the band. The connection between her and Joe happened after that, which might feel intrusive from Ben's perspective. But the mother might argue that her relationship with Joe is separate from her relationship with Ben. However, the key issues are the power dynamics and the potential for conflict of interest, especially since they were colleagues. \n\nAlso, Ben is an adult, so while the mother wants to support him, the relationship could be complicated. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's honest with both Ben and Joe and if there's no conflict of interest. But there are potential problems. The mother and Joe were colleagues, which could lead to workplace issues if they start dating. Also, Ben's feelings are valid; it's natural for him to feel uncomfortable if his mother starts dating a friend. \n\nBut the mother's actions were initially to help her son, so maybe the relationship wasn't her intention from the start. However, the transition from being a colleague and friend of her son to dating that person could be seen as crossing a boundary. The mother's age (38) and Joe's (29) might also be a factor, though age differences are generally not a problem unless there's a power imbalance. \n\nConsidering all this, the mother might not be in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and she handles it respectfully, but there are definitely complexities. The answer likely depends on the specific circumstances and how they manage the relationships. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on ethical considerations and social norms. The mother did start the interaction with the intent to help her son, and the romantic feelings developed later. However, the fact that they were colleagues adds another layer. In many workplaces, relationships between colleagues are allowed as long as they're consensual, but if they're in different departments, it might be less problematic. Still, Ben's feelings are important, and the mother should consider his perspective. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the relationship seems to have developed naturally, and the mother's initial intent was to help her son. However, there are potential issues that need to be navigated, like transparency and Ben's feelings. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the mother's actions don't seem malicious. So B is the correct answer.\n"
