His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mom who had her son Ben when she was 17. Now Ben is 21, and she's 38. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, and Joe, a colleague, ended up joining the band. Initially, it was just work colleagues, but then they started texting and the author now feels like she has a crush on Joe. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if she dated his friend Matt from middle school. The author thinks it's different but is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference between the author and Joe (38 vs 29), the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the dynamic of their relationship. The author is Ben's mother, so there's a parent-child relationship to consider. Ben is an adult now, 21, so he's of legal age, but there's still the emotional aspect of a parent dating someone close to their adult child.\n\nNow, possible angles to consider:\n\n1. Parent-Child Relationship: The author is Ben's mother, and dating his friend might make Ben feel uncomfortable. Even if Ben is an adult, the parent's relationship with someone close can affect the parent-child dynamic. However, the author is also an adult, so she has the right to date whoever she wants.\n\n2. Age Difference: The author is older than Joe by 9 years. Age differences aren't inherently problematic, but in some contexts, they can raise questions. However, both are adults, so it's their choice.\n\n3. The Role of the Son: Ben is 21, so he's an adult. He might feel it's awkward or like a breach of trust, even if he's independent. The mother might need to consider his feelings, but she's entitled to her own relationships.\n\n4. The Mother's Intentions: She started the conversation with Joe through the band, and it evolved from there. There's no indication of manipulation or coercion. If both parties are comfortable, it's their choice.\n\n5. Social Norms: There's a general discomfort in society about parents dating their children's friends, even if the child is an adult. This might be why the author is seeking validation.\n\n6. Ben's Reaction: He's upset and comparing it to another scenario. The author might need to address his feelings without compromising her own happiness. However, if Ben is still in a vulnerable state due to depression, the mother's actions could affect him negatively.\n\n7. Legal vs. Ethical: Legally, there's no issue since both are adults. Ethically, it's more about the family dynamics and mutual consent.\n\nPotential Issues:\n- The mother's relationship could affect Ben's trust and sense of privacy. If Ben feels his mother is overstepping by pursuing someone he's close to, that could strain their relationship.\n- The mother might be prioritizing her own needs over her son's emotional well-being, which could be seen as selfish, but she's also an adult with her own life.\n- The fact that Joe is a colleague could complicate things if they work in the same organization, though the author mentioned they are in different departments.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her actions are unkind or unethical. If both she and Joe are comfortable, and Ben, being an adult, can express his feelings, then the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the mother is acting in a way that disregards her son's feelings, maybe she should reconsider. But since Ben is an adult, he can handle the situation himself, though it's still sensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother's actions aren't inherently wrong. She's an adult with the right to date someone she's connected with. However, the situation is awkward and could cause tension with her son. The key is whether she's being respectful of Ben's feelings while also maintaining her own autonomy. Since the scenario doesn't indicate any coercion or harm, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
