His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author is a single mom who had her son Ben when she was 17. Now Ben is 21, and she's 38. Ben has been dealing with depression but is in therapy. He was in a band that disbanded, and the author helped him start a new one. Joe, a 29-year-old coworker, joined the band. The author met Joe through Ben's project, and they started talking. Eventually, they began texting and spending time together, which upset Ben. He's upset because he feels it's weird and compares it to dating a close friend. The author argues that Joe is part of the band, not a close friend like his middle school buddy Matt.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference between the author and Joe, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the power dynamic if they work together. Wait, the author says she gives Joe the number from the flyer, but later they start talking more. Then Ben gets upset. The author is 38, Joe is 29. The son is 21. So the son and Joe are the same age. The author is older than Joe, which might not be the typical parent-child dynamic, but she's Ben's mother. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the mother is dating someone her son considers a friend. This could create tension, especially since the son is still young and might feel uncomfortable. However, the author isn't his parent in a legal sense\u2014it's been 21 years since she had him. But socially, she's still his mother, and the son's feelings matter. \n\nAlso, if they work together, there could be a conflict of interest. The author might be in a position where she has authority or influence over Joe at work, which complicates their personal relationship. But the story doesn't mention their job roles, so maybe they're just coworkers with no direct supervisory relationship. \n\nBen is an adult now (21), so he's legally an adult, but the emotional dynamics might still be tricky. The mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult too, and Joe is an adult. However, Ben's feelings are hurt, and the mother's actions could affect their relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the son's mental health. Since he's been dealing with depression, this situation might add stress. The mother's intention was to help him make friends through the band, but now her dating Joe is causing him distress. That's a valid point. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, dating someone's friend can be complicated. But the mother isn't his parent in a legal sense anymore; he's an adult. So technically, she's free to date whoever she wants. However, the social bond with her son is strong, and his reaction is valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a mix. The mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices, but she might need to consider her son's feelings and the potential for conflict. The answer could depend on whether there's a power dynamic at work or if it's purely a personal relationship. Since the story doesn't specify work roles, maybe it's not a power issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong), but there are nuances. Alternatively, if the son's feelings are the main point, maybe A. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user wants a binary answer: A for yes (author wrong), B for no. The key here is whether the author's actions are ethically wrong. If she's an adult dating another adult, even if they're her son's friend, it's a personal choice. But the son's perspective is valid. However, the mother isn't in the wrong for choosing to date someone; it's about respecting boundaries. If there's no conflict of interest in the workplace and she's not interfering with the son's life in a way that harms him, then B. But if Ben's distress is significant and she's not considering his feelings, then A. The story says Ben is upset, but it's his friend. The mother's actions could be seen as okay unless there's a direct harm. So maybe B.\n"
