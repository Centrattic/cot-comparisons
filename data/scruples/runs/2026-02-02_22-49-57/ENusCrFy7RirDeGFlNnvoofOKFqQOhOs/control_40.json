His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother dating her son's friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother is a single parent who raised her son, Ben, since he was 17. Ben is now 21 and has been dealing with depression. They have a close relationship, and she's been helping him with his band. She posted a flyer for the band at her workplace, where her colleague Joe saw it. Joe ended up joining the band, and they started interacting more. Then, during a coffee meetup, they started texting and developing a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother is unsure if she's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference and the relationship dynamics. The mother is 38, the colleague Joe is 29. Ben is 21. The mother is in a position of authority as a parent and possibly at work if Joe is her colleague. However, the user mentions that Joe is 29, which is an adult, and the mother is also an adult. The potential issues here could be the power dynamic if there's a supervisory relationship, but the story doesn't specify that the mother is Joe's supervisor. It just says they work in different departments. If there's no power imbalance in the workplace, then that's not an issue.\n\nAnother angle is the close relationship between the mother and son. Ben is 21, which is an adult age, but they've been through a lot together. The mother might be very protective or have a strong emotional bond. Ben's reaction is about it being weird and the comparison to his friend. The mother's actions led to Joe being part of Ben's band, and then their relationship developing. The question is whether starting a romantic relationship with someone who is connected to her son is inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's not uncommon for people to date friends of family members, but there can be complications, especially when it affects family dynamics. The mother might not be in the wrong if both she and Joe are adults and the relationship is consensual. However, if the mother is in a position of authority over Joe (like a supervisor), that could be a problem. Since the story doesn't mention her being his manager, maybe that's not the case here.\n\nBen's feelings are important too. He's upset, which could indicate that the mother's actions might disrupt their relationship. But Ben is an adult, so he might need to handle his own feelings. The mother's perspective is that she's not doing anything wrong because it's different from dating his friend from middle school. The key is whether there's a conflict of interest or harm caused. If the band is still functioning and Joe is a friend, maybe it's not the mother's fault. However, the fact that she met Joe through Ben's band might create tension. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother not dating in a long time, so she might feel a connection. It's a sensitive situation, but unless there's a clear ethical boundary crossed (like if Joe was a minor or there's a power imbalance), the mother might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because both are adults, and the relationship isn't inherently unethical unless there's a specific reason it's problematic. The main issues are the emotional impact on Ben and the potential for awkwardness, but that doesn't necessarily make the mother wrong.\n"
