His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation is that she's a single mom, her son is 21, and she met Joe, a colleague who's 29 and now part of the band her son started. They started talking, then texting, and the son got upset. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is 38, single for a while, and her son has been dealing with depression. She's trying to help him make friends by starting a band, which led her to connect with Joe. The son is 21, so he's an adult now. The mom is 17 years older than the son, but the son is an adult, so maybe the mom's age isn't directly relevant here. \n\nThe main issue is about the boundary between a parent and their adult child's friend. The son is upset because he compares it to dating his friend Matt, but maybe the difference is that Joe is now part of his social circle through the band, and the mom met him in a work context. Also, the son is 21, so maybe he's more sensitive because he's still adjusting to his mother dating again after being single for so long. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, parents dating someone their child knows might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the child is still in a dependent role. But since the son is an adult, he's legally and emotionally supposed to have his own autonomy. However, the mom's actions might make the son feel uncomfortable, especially if he's already dealing with mental health issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is an adult who's finding a social connection, which is healthy for her. She met Joe in a professional context but moved into a personal relationship. However, she gave Joe her son's number, which could be a point of contention. She might be overstepping by connecting them in a way that leads to her relationship with Joe. \n\nBut considering that the son is 21 and they live together (since she's the single mom), there's still a cohabitation dynamic that might make the situation more personal. The son might feel like his mother is prioritizing her own needs over his comfort. However, the mother is also an adult with the right to pursue relationships. \n\nAnother angle is whether the mom's actions were inappropriate in the first place. She gave Joe the flyer with the son's number, which led to the band forming. Then, she engaged in conversation with Joe, which led to a personal relationship. It's possible she didn't foresee the implications when she gave Joe the number. \n\nLegally, there's no issue because both are adults. But socially, it's about boundaries. The key is whether the mom's actions were respectful of her son's feelings and if she considered the potential impact. The son's reaction is valid because he feels it's weird, but the mom's actions were done with the intention to help her son's band and then to connect with a colleague. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is not straightforward. But since the son is an adult and the mother is an adult, they should both have the right to their own relationships. The mother isn't necessarily wrong, but she might need to be sensitive to her son's feelings. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer here is probably B, because she isn't in the wrong, but she might need to navigate the situation carefully.\n"
