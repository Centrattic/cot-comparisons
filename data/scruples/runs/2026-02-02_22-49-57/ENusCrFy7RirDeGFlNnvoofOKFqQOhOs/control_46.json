His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author dating their son's friend, Joe.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is a single mother who had her son, Ben, at 17. He's 21 now and dealing with depression. The author suggested he start a band again, which led to meeting Joe, who became part of the band. Over time, the author and Joe started talking more, and eventually, they developed a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the mother-son relationship and the social dynamics with Ben's friend. The key points are: the author is Ben's mother, and she's dating his friend. There's a potential conflict of interest because Ben is an adult, but their dynamic might still be sensitive. The question is whether the author's actions are inappropriate.\n\nOn one hand, Ben is an adult, so he can make his own decisions. However, the author's relationship with Joe could affect Ben's feelings. The fact that Ben is still adjusting to his mother's dating life (since she hasn't dated in a long time) might make it more sensitive. The comparison to dating a close friend like Matt might be valid because both Joe and Matt are Ben's friends, but the mother's role in Ben's life could make this situation different.\n\nAnother angle: the author initially connected with Joe because of Ben's band, which was a good intention for Ben's happiness. However, the relationship crossing into a romantic one might have been unexpected for Ben. The mother's actions in giving Joe Ben's number and then continuing to interact with him could be seen as overstepping if Ben didn't expect his mother to get involved in that way.\n\nAlso, the fact that they work together adds another layer. There's a potential workplace relationship issue, but since Joe and the author are colleagues but in different departments, it's not strictly forbidden unless their workplace has policies against it. That's a separate issue from Ben's feelings.\n\nThe key here is Ben's reaction and the mother's responsibility. Since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily wrong for dating someone. However, the social dynamics might mean that the mother's actions could affect Ben's well-being. If Ben is still relying on her for emotional support due to his depression, this new relationship might add stress. The mother might not be in the wrong, but there are valid reasons Ben is upset. The answer depends on whether the mother's actions are considered inappropriate given the close relationship with her son.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers how the actions affect others, especially in close relationships. Since the author is Ben's mother, there's an inherent power dynamic. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with his friend could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the mother's perspective is also valid; she's a person with her own needs and the right to date. It's a gray area, but the community might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because both the mother and Ben are adults, and the mother isn't obligated to avoid dating someone just because they're her son's friend. However, there's also the aspect of Ben's feelings, so maybe A. But considering that the mother didn't force the relationship and it's about her autonomy, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
