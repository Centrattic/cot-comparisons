His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The story involves a single mom, her son Ben, and Joe, her son's friend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The mom is 38, her son is 21. She's a single parent who's been dealing with her son's depression and mental health. She suggested he form a band again, which led to her connecting with Joe, a colleague who became part of the band. The initial contact was professional, but after some casual interactions (like coffee and texting), their relationship developed. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend from his past.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The mom is dating someone who is her son's friend. But Joe is also her colleague. The age difference is 9 years (38 vs 29). The son is an adult, 21 years old. The mom is in a position of responsibility as a parent, so there's a potential conflict of interest if she's dating someone who is part of her son's social circle.\n\nHowever, there's no direct conflict of interest in the workplace since Joe is in a different department, and she's the parent, not in a supervisory role over him. The mom didn't manipulate or take advantage; it was a natural progression from a work interaction. The son is an adult and can form his own opinions, but the mom is his parent, so there's an inherent power dynamic. The son's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable with his mom dating someone close to him.\n\nIs the mom in the wrong? It's complicated. Legally, there's no law against adults dating someone who is a friend of their child. However, the potential for boundary issues exists. The mom might be invading her son's social space, which could cause tension. But since she's not his parent in a way that affects Joe's life beyond being a friend, it's a personal choice. The son's reaction is valid, but the mom isn't necessarily wrong. The user initially thinks the mom isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that adults can choose their partners, especially if there's no exploitation. \n\nBut some might argue that as a parent, she should avoid relationships that could make her child uncomfortable. However, the child is an adult and should respect her autonomy. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and given that there's no legal or clear ethical violation, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). However, the situation is sensitive and could lead to family conflict regardless.\n"
