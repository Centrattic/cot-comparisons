His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother dating her son's friend, who is also a colleague. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. I need to decide if it's A (author is wrong) or B (author isn't).\n\nFirst, let me recap the details. The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was young. Ben has depression and is lonely. She suggested he start a band again. He made posters, she posted one at work where she met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe ended up joining Ben's band. Initially, there was some awkwardness because they're coworkers, but the mom didn't mind because Ben was happy. Then, during a coffee meeting with Joe (because Ben was late), they started texting more, and the mom feels a connection, similar to a high school crush. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mom thinks it's different because Joe is a colleague and her son's friend, but she's not sure.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main points are the power dynamics and the relationship boundaries. Since the mother and Joe are colleagues, there might be a workplace policy against dating. Even if they're in different departments, some companies have rules about romantic relationships between employees, especially if one is a supervisor or there's a perceived power imbalance. However, the scenario doesn't mention any such policies being violated, but that's an assumption. Also, the mother hasn't been dating in a while, so maybe she's looking for companionship.\n\nBen's reaction is understandable because he's 21 and might feel like his mom is getting too close to his peer. The comparison to Matt (his friend since middle school) makes sense because it's similar to dating a friend's friend. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since Joe is Ben's friend. However, the mother's intention was to support her son by helping him form the band, and her relationship with Joe started after that as a personal connection.\n\nAnother angle is the potential emotional impact on Ben. If the mother starts a romantic relationship with Joe, Ben might feel uncomfortable or like his privacy is invaded. The mother might not realize how this affects her son's social circle. Also, the fact that Joe is a colleague adds another layer; workplace relationships can be tricky and might affect both their professional environments.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date. The situation might not be inherently wrong if both parties are consensual and there's no coercion. However, the key here is the relationship to Ben. The mother's role as a parent creates a dependency in Ben, and dating his friend could complicate their dynamic. It's possible that Ben is feeling neglected or that his mother is prioritizing her personal life over his well-being, even if that's not the case.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a common expectation that parents shouldn't date their child's peers, especially friends. It can be seen as inappropriate because it might make the child feel awkward or like they can't trust their friend. However, the mother might argue that she's not interfering with Ben's friendships but forming her own. The fact that Ben is an adult adds complexity\u2014maybe he should have more autonomy, but he's still in a dependent situation due to his age and mental health struggles.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on whether the mother's actions are respectful of Ben's feelings and if they maintain appropriate boundaries. Since Ben is upset and the mother is aware of the potential awkwardness, it's possible that she is in the wrong from Ben's perspective, but from an adult autonomy standpoint, she has the right to date. However, the key ethical issue is the impact on Ben. If the mother pursues the relationship despite Ben's discomfort, it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings, making her at fault. But if she's careful to respect his boundaries and ensure that Ben isn't negatively affected, then it's a personal choice.\n"
