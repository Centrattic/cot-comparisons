His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The parent is a single mom who had her son Ben at 17. Now Ben is 21, dealing with depression, and the mom is trying to help him with a band. She met Joe, a colleague, through Ben's band. They ended up talking and dating, which upset Ben because he's close to Joe as a friend since middle school.\n\nSo, the key points here: The mom is Ben's age (38 vs 21). Ben has been struggling, and the mom has been his primary caregiver. She connected with Joe through Ben's band, and they started dating. Ben is upset because he feels it's inappropriate, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nI need to consider different angles. From a parent's perspective, forming a relationship with someone their adult child knows could be seen as crossing a boundary. But Ben is an adult now (21), so maybe the mom isn't necessarily violating any strict rules. However, there's the aspect of the parent-child relationship dynamics. The mom has been a single parent, and Ben might feel that his mom is encroaching on his social circle or creating a conflict in their relationship. \n\nAlso, the mom might not have considered Ben's feelings in this situation. She connected with Joe through Ben's band, which is part of his life, and Ben found out they were dating. The son's reaction is emotional because he feels it's inappropriate. \n\nEthically, is it wrong for a parent to date someone their adult child is friends with? It's a gray area. Some might say that as long as both the parent and the adult child are okay with it, it's fine. But the son is clearly upset here. The mother's actions could be seen as prioritizing her own happiness but possibly disregarding her son's feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the mother was a single parent for a long time, and Ben has been struggling. She might feel isolated and looking for companionship. But by choosing someone connected to her son, it could create tension. The son might feel that his mom is overstepping by dating his friend, even if they're adults. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the mother's relationship with Joe. If they met through Ben's band, there's a potential for a conflict of interest if Joe is working with Ben. However, the band is more about Ben's social life, and Joe is now part of that. \n\nI think the key here is whether the mother acted with consideration for her son's feelings. She didn't consult him before starting the relationship, and Ben felt it was inappropriate. Even though he's an adult, the mother's role as a parent might require her to be more cautious about such relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't obligated to consult her adult son before dating. But given the close relationship they've had, especially with Ben's history of depression, her actions might have caused unintended harm. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective: If the mother prioritized her own needs without considering her son's feelings, she might be in the wrong (A). If she's just an adult seeking a relationship and the son needs to respect her autonomy, then it's not her fault (B). \n\nBut given that the son is upset and the mother didn't consider the potential impact on him, it's possible she's in the wrong. However, the son is an adult, and the mother isn't necessarily prohibited from dating. It's a complicated situation where both parties have valid points. But in AITA scenarios, the answer often leans towards considering the impact on others. Since the son is Ben, the mother's actions might have caused him distress, making the mother at least partially responsible, hence AITA.\n"
