His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The scenario is that the mother, who's been a single parent, connects with Joe, a colleague, who becomes part of her son's band. They start talking more, and eventually, the mother feels a connection. The son is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The mother is 38, the son is 21, and Joe is 29. The son had a history of depression and needed support. The mother's intention was initially to help her son by getting him back into a band. By connecting Joe with her son, she was helping his social life and mental health, which seems well-meaning.\n\nNow, the issue arises when the mother starts dating Joe. The son feels it's weird, comparing it to dating a friend. But the key difference here is that Joe is a friend of the son, but not the son's close friend in the same way as someone like Matt, who's a lifelong friend since middle school. Joe is part of the band, which the mother suggested as a way for Ben to socialize. The mother's relationship with Joe started professionally, then became more personal after meeting through the band.\n\nEthically, there are a few points to consider. The mother is in a position of influence over her son's life, especially since he was struggling with depression. If she starts a relationship with someone who is connected to her son's social circle, the son might feel his privacy or autonomy is invaded. However, the mother is an adult, and Joe is also an adult. They are both capable of making their own decisions. The fact that they met through the son's band might complicate things, but the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with an adult colleague.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The son is 21, which is an adult age, but he was still under the care of his mother, especially during his college years. The mother might be overstepping if she's using her position as a parent to influence her son's social circle, but since she's not his legal guardian anymore (assuming he's independent), the lines are blurred. However, the mother's actions were primarily to support her son's mental health first, and the romantic relationship came later.\n\nThe son's reaction is understandable\u2014he might feel that his friend is now part of a parental relationship he didn't consent to. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since she's the parent and Joe is part of the son's friend group. But since both the mother and Joe are adults, and the relationship didn't start with the intention to interfere with the son's friendships, the mother isn't necessarily wrong. The son's feelings are valid, but the mother's autonomy as an adult matters too.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices, and her initial intentions were to help her son. The son's discomfort is valid, but the mother isn't obligated to avoid dating someone who isn't a direct family friend. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
