His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mother of a 21-year-old son starts dating his friend, who's also a colleague. The son got upset because he found out they were dating. The mother is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. The son is 21. The mother and Joe started interacting because of the son's band. The mother initially met Joe at work when she posted a flyer for the band. Joe ended up joining the band. Later, when the son was late, the mother had a coffee with Joe, and they started texting. The son is upset, comparing it to dating a friend from middle school.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, is the mother in the wrong? Well, the son is an adult, so legally, the mother doesn't have authority over his friends. However, there's the aspect of the mother-son dynamic. The mother might have played a role in connecting Joe with the son through the band. Then, the mother and Joe started a relationship after the son was already friends with Joe. \n\nThere's a potential conflict of interest here. If the son is still living with his mother and they have a close relationship, the mother dating a friend of the son could create tension. Also, the mother and Joe are colleagues, which adds another layer. In some workplaces, dating a colleague can be against company policy, especially if there's a power dynamic, but since they're in different departments, maybe that's less of an issue. But it's not clear if there's a policy here.\n\nThe son's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable with his mother dating his friend. It's a sensitive situation because the son might feel that his trust or space is being invaded. The mother might be seen as overstepping if she initiated the relationship after being introduced through her son. Also, the fact that she's the parent and Joe is a friend of her son might make others think it's inappropriate because it could affect the son's relationships.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date whoever she chooses. The son is also an adult, so he should respect his mother's autonomy. However, the way the relationship started through the son's social circle might complicate things. The mother might not have intended to date Joe, but the situation evolved. The key point is whether the mother's actions are causing harm. If the son is upset and the relationship affects their dynamic, maybe the mother needs to consider that. But if the son is just feeling uncomfortable without any valid reason, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother isn't doing anything illegal, but socially, there could be judgment. The answer depends on whether the mother's actions are considered inappropriate in the context of the relationships. Since the son is an adult, the mother is within her rights to date Joe, but the situation might require sensitivity towards the son's feelings. However, the question is if she's in the \"wrong.\" If the son is the one who is upset, but there's no actual harm done, maybe the mother isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have been more cautious to avoid the relationship given the connections. I think it's more on the side of not being in the wrong because she's an adult and the son is an adult too, but the social awkwardness is on both sides. So, answer B.\n"
