His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is that the mother, who's been a single parent since her son was young, suggested he start a band again. She posted a flyer at her workplace, where her colleague Joe saw it, joined the band, and later they started talking more. Now the son is upset because he thinks it's weird and compares it to dating a lifelong friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother is 38, the son is 21, and Joe is 29. The son has been dealing with depression and is introverted, so having friends and a band is important for his well-being. The mother's actions might have been to help her son and then ended up developing a relationship with Joe, who is now part of the band.\n\nIs it wrong for a parent to date someone their adult child knows? Since the son is 21, he's an adult, but the dynamic here is tricky. The mother was the one who connected Joe with her son for the band. Now she's dating Joe. The son might feel like his friend is being taken from him or that there's a breach of trust. But the mother's intention was to help her son. \n\nHowever, there's a potential conflict of interest. The mother might be in a position of authority or influence if she works with Joe. If she's a colleague, even in different departments, there could be issues with workplace relationships. Also, the son is still in college, so he's in a formative stage, and his mother dating a friend might make him feel uncomfortable or like she's overstepping.\n\nBut the mother didn't know Joe before the band thing. She met him through helping her son. The son's reaction seems to be more about the discomfort of his mother having a romantic relationship with someone he's close to. The mother's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, could be seen as inappropriate because it's a parent-child dynamic. Even though the son is an adult, the mother might have a responsibility to consider how her actions affect him, especially given his history of depression and loneliness.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother hasn't dated in a long time and might be forming a connection with Joe naturally. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with someone who is now a friend of her adult son. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the son perceives it, but generally, parents dating someone their adult child knows can be tricky and might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intentions are good. So the answer might be A, yes, she is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The main issue is the relationship between the mother and a colleague/friend of her son. The mother's role is as a parent, and dating someone connected to her child could cause tension. The fact that she initially introduced Joe to her son for a band might have created an expectation of a certain dynamic. So I think the answer is A.\n"
