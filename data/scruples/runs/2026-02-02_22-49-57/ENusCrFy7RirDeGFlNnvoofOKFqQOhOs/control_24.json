His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who connected her son with a colleague, Joe, who became part of the son's band. Over time, the mother and Joe started talking more, leading to a relationship, which upset the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother was a single parent, and her son, Ben, is 21. The mother was 17 when Ben was born, so she's a young mother who's had to manage alone. Ben's been dealing with depression and now is in a band with Joe. The mother connected them at work, which seems like a good move to help Ben. But then she started talking to Joe, leading to a relationship.\n\nThe son is upset because he feels it's similar to dating a friend from his past. The mother argues it's different. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social perspective, there's a power dynamic and a potential conflict of interest. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. If the mother starts a relationship with Joe, it could create tension between parent and child, even if the mother isn't the parent in the traditional sense anymore. Also, the mother and Joe met through work, which could complicate things professionally if they're colleagues.\n\nHowever, the mother is an adult, and if she's not in a position of authority over Joe (like if they're in different departments and just colleagues), there's an argument for her right to date someone. But the fact that Joe is a friend of her son adds an emotional layer. The son's distress is valid because of the close relationship he has with Joe. The mother might not see the connection, but the son could feel betrayed or uncomfortable.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's relationship with Joe. She was the one who connected them professionally, and then the relationship developed. There's a possibility of nepotism or favoritism if they're still working together. Also, Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but he's still emotionally dependent on his mother given his history with mental health. His reaction might stem from feeling that his mother's actions interfere with his friendships and his own emotional well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the mother's actions are ethically wrong. On one hand, she's an adult with the right to date. On the other hand, the situation could be seen as exploiting a connection made with her son's friend. The son's feelings are important, and the mother's actions could damage their relationship. The mother might not have intended to, but by dating Joe, she's stepping into a role that could make the son feel like his parent is prioritizing a new relationship over his needs, especially since he's still dealing with depression.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, relationships between adults and close friends of their children are often frowned upon because of the potential for conflict and the blurring of boundaries. Even if the mother isn't Ben's legal guardian anymore, the emotional bond is still strong. The fact that the son is upset suggests there's a problem here, even if the mother doesn't see it the same way.\n\nAdditionally, the mother met Joe through her work, so there's a professional aspect to consider. If they're still working together, a relationship could be against company policy or create an uncomfortable work environment. But the son's issue is more about the personal connection to his friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mother's actions might not be illegal or strictly unethical, but they do create a situation where her son feels hurt and betrayed. The mother should consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. While she has the right to date, the context here\u2014meeting through the son's friend, the son's mental health struggles, and the possible professional implications\u2014makes her in the wrong in terms of how it affects her son and the dynamics of their family.\n"
