His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend, Joe. The author is a single mother who had her son Ben at 17, now he's 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. The author suggested starting a band, and Joe, a colleague, joined the band. They interacted for the band's sake, and then their relationship evolved into texting and eventually dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the potential issues here. The main concern is the age difference and the fact that the author is Ben's mother, so there's a parent-child relationship dynamic. However, the author is 38 and Joe is 29. The age difference isn't that large, but it's still significant. Also, Joe is Ben's friend, which adds another layer of complexity because Ben is upset about it. \n\nAnother angle is that the author and Joe started interacting because of Ben's band. The author facilitated Joe joining the band, which was for Ben's benefit. The initial interactions were work-related, then moved to coffee and texting. The author mentions that she hasn't dated in a long time and it feels like a high school crush, which might indicate that she's entering a new relationship quickly after being single for years. \n\nBen is 21, an adult, but he's still in the process of healing from depression and might feel vulnerable. His reaction to finding out about the relationship could stem from feeling that his friend is now taken by his mother, which is a common sibling jealousy scenario but in this case with a parent. However, Ben is also an adult, so he might have his own perspective on the appropriateness of the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics between parent, child, and the friend. The author's intentions were initially to help Ben by facilitating the band. The relationship with Joe started as a professional connection but transitioned into a personal one. The question is whether the author overstepped by entering a romantic relationship with someone who is a close friend of her son, even though Joe isn't a friend of the author before. \n\nThere's also the aspect of workplace relationships. The author and Joe work in different departments but are colleagues. Dating a colleague can be tricky, but since they aren't in the same department, maybe it's manageable. However, the fact that Joe is a friend of her son complicates things further.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, there's no explicit rule against it, but socially, it's considered awkward or inappropriate because of the parent-son relationship. The mother's actions might unintentionally affect Ben's feelings, even if he's an adult. The son's reaction indicates that he feels uncomfortable, which is a valid concern. However, the mother's right to pursue a relationship isn't inherently wrong, especially since she's an adult.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did facilitate Joe's involvement in the band, which was for Ben's benefit. The romantic relationship developed later, possibly because of the close proximity and shared interests. The author might not have intended to date Joe, but the relationship formed naturally, which complicates matters. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. While the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date, the situation is sensitive due to the relationships involved. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics within Ben's family. However, since Ben is an adult and capable of handling his own feelings, the author's decision isn't entirely her fault. She might need to consider Ben's feelings and communicate with both him and Joe to ensure that the relationship doesn't harm their family dynamic.\n"
