His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a single mom, is dating her son's friend, Joe. The son is 21, and Joe is 29. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and son have a close relationship, especially since she was a single parent. The son was dealing with depression and needed support. The mother suggested a band, which led to Joe joining. Initially, it was just about helping her son, but then the mother and Joe started talking more, leading to a relationship.\n\nThe son is upset because he finds it weird. He compares it to if his mom dated his friend Matt, but the author thinks it's different. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong by dating her son's friend.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say it's inappropriate because of the potential for conflict in the family dynamic. The mother is in a position of parental influence, and the son might feel betrayed. However, the son is an adult, so maybe the mother has the right to her own life. Also, the author hasn't dated anyone since Ben's father, so she might be lonely and forming a relationship with someone who is now part of her son's life.\n\nBut there's also the fact that Joe was introduced through the son's band. The mother helped connect them, which could make the son feel like his friend is being used, even if unintentionally. The son's reaction is valid because of the close relationship he has with his mom. However, the mother is an adult, and as long as the relationship is consensual and not predatory, it's her choice.\n\nAnother angle: the mother and Joe met through work, and Joe is part of the band. The initial connection was to help the son, but the relationship developed naturally. The mother might not be in the wrong because she's not forcing anything; it's a personal choice. However, the potential for causing her son emotional distress is a factor. The son's feelings are important, and the mother should consider that even if the relationship is appropriate.\n\nBut the son is an adult, so he should be able to handle his mother having her own life. The mother isn't stealing the son's friend; she's forming her own relationship. The key here is whether the mother crossed a boundary. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. However, in many cases, as long as there's no coercion and all parties are adults, it's up to the individuals involved. The mother isn't in the wrong, but she might need to manage the situation carefully to respect her son's feelings.\n"
