His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who, after introducing her son's friend to a band, ends up developing a relationship with him. The son is upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend, but the mother feels it's different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications. The mother's intentions were to help her son by connecting him with someone who could join the band. She didn't intend to date Joe initially. The relationship developed after Joe and her son became friends. The son is 21, an adult, so there's no legal issue here regarding consent. The mother is 38, so age difference is about 16 years, which is common in many relationships.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, some might argue that there's a boundary crossed because Joe is a friend of her son. However, the mother didn't prevent her son from having friends or interfere in his social life. The son's reaction is based on personal discomfort rather than any harm done. The mother didn't manipulate or take advantage; the relationship formed naturally after work interactions.\n\nThe son's comparison to dating a friend from middle school might be a bit extreme since Joe is a friend through the band, not a lifelong friend. The mother's actions were initially to support her son's interests, and the relationship with Joe happened organically. There's no indication that she encouraged the relationship immediately after meeting Joe; it developed over time.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing. Socially, it's a sensitive situation, but not necessarily unethical. Boundaries can be subjective. The key here is that the mother is an adult making her own choices, and her son's feelings are valid but not a justification for her being in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal norms and individual perspectives, but given the circumstances, the mother isn't in the wrong.\n"
