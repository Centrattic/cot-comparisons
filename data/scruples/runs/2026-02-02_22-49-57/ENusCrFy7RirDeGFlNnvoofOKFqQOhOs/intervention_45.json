His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a single mother, started dating Joe, who is her son Ben's friend. Joe was initially a colleague of hers at work and later joined Ben's band. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, the son is 21, and Joe is 29. The mother has been a single parent for Ben's entire life, and she's been trying to support him with his depression and helping him find social connections through the band. The relationship with Joe started after he joined the band, and their initial interaction was work-related but not personal. Then, when Ben was late, the mother invited Joe for coffee, leading to more personal conversations and eventual texting.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the mother is in the wrong by dating her son's friend. There are a few angles to consider. From Ben's perspective, it's likely unsettling because he's used to his mother being a parent figure, and now she's entering a romantic relationship with a peer. This could affect their relationship, especially since Ben was already dealing with social isolation and depression. The mother might see Joe as a way to support Ben by being part of his social circle, but the line was crossed when the relationship became romantic.\n\nHowever, the mother isn't in the wrong necessarily. She didn't intentionally set out to date Joe; it developed naturally after he became part of Ben's band and their professional interaction. The mother was alone for a long time and found emotional support in Joe, which is understandable. Ben's reaction is valid, but it's more about the dynamic shift rather than the mother's actions being inherently wrong. The key points are consent, the mother's intentions, and the impact on Ben.\n\nBut there's a potential for a conflict of interest or inappropriate boundaries. If Joe was a colleague, even if they work in different departments, the workplace relationship could be a concern. However, the romantic interest came after he joined the band and they were no longer coworkers. The mother might have considered that transition, but the perception might still be an issue, especially if the company has policies against romantic relationships.\n\nAnother aspect is the age difference. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. While there's a 9-year gap, it's not an extreme difference. However, the mother's role as a parent to Ben's friend could be seen as a conflict. Ben is an adult, though, so he's capable of making his own decisions about his relationships. The mother isn't dating Ben's sibling or a childhood friend in the same way as Matt, but Joe is a recent friend through the band. The comparison to \"what if you dated Matt\" might be a stretch since Matt has been a long-term friend.\n\nThe mother's actions led to the relationship, but she might not have considered Ben's feelings. However, since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. The main issue is the impact on Ben and how the mother handles the situation now. It's possible that the mother is in the wrong if the relationship creates tension or undermines Ben's well-being, but the initial actions might be more about her personal life and right to form relationships.\n\nIn summary, the mother didn't act with malicious intent. She helped Ben by encouraging his band, which led to Joe joining. The romantic relationship developed after that, and while it's awkward for Ben, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date. However, she should be sensitive to Ben's feelings and ensure that her relationship doesn't interfere with his well-being. The answer might be B (No), as she isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both parties need to communicate and respect each other's feelings.\n"
