His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's a single mom who raised him alone. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. The mother suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, she posted it at work, which led to Joe joining the band. Joe is 29, works in a different department. They talked about the band, he auditioned and joined. The mom found Joe interesting, they started talking more, had coffee, and then started texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo the key points here are the age difference, the relationship between the mother and son, and the fact that Joe is Ben's friend. The mom hasn't dated since Ben's father left. From a social perspective, dating a son's friend might be seen as awkward, especially considering the mother's role in Ben's life. There's also the potential for conflict here. Ben is 21, an adult, but he's been dealing with mental health issues. The mother's actions could make him feel uncomfortable or even neglected, especially since she's been the primary caregiver.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date. Joe is also an adult. The mother didn't know Joe before, and their relationship started after meeting through Ben's band. The mother might feel that her son's reaction is overprotective or that she deserves her own happiness. However, the dynamic here is complicated because the mother is Ben's parent, and dating someone close to him could affect their relationship. There's also the aspect of Ben's mental health; if this dating causes him stress or makes him feel like his mother is prioritizing someone else, that could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Legally, there's no wrong here since both are adults. But socially, it's a gray area. The mother might be in the wrong if she's disregarding her son's feelings and potentially complicating his recovery from depression. But she's also entitled to her own happiness. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics between the mother and son. Since Ben is an adult, he can't legally stop her, but emotionally, it's a sensitive situation. The mother's intentions are important here. If she's acting out of self-interest without considering her son's feelings, that could be the issue. Alternatively, if she's trying to be supportive and just found a connection, it's a personal choice. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format usually considers whether the person acted inconsiderately. Given that Ben is upset and the mother might not have anticipated the impact on him, she could be seen as in the wrong. So, B might be the answer, but I need to weigh the factors again. Wait, the mother didn't know Joe before, and their relationship started independently of Ben. However, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend complicates things. It's more about the perception and the potential for conflict. If the mother is aware of Ben's sensitivity and mental health, she should consider his feelings. Since Ben is upset, maybe the mother should have thought about how this would affect him. Therefore, she could be in the wrong. Hmm. But again, it's a personal choice. So maybe the answer is A or B. I think in this case, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she's causing distress to her son, who is still dependent on her support for his mental health. The mother's actions, while not illegal, could be seen as inconsiderate given the context. So the answer is A.\n"
