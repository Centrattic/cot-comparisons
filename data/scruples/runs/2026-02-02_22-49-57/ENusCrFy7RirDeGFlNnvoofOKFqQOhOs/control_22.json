His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the mother had her son at 17, became a single mom, and now her son is 21. The son was in a band that disbanded, so she suggested starting a new one. She made a flyer, met Joe at work, who became part of the band. They started getting along, then the mother invited Joe over for coffee when her son was late. They talked, connected, and started texting. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend.\n\nSo, is the mother at fault? Well, from a social perspective, there's a taboo about romantic relationships with your child's friends, even if the child is an adult. But the son is 21, an adult, so maybe he's overreacting. The mother didn't plan to date the son's friend; it developed naturally after meeting through the band. The son's reaction is based on feeling weird, but does he have the right to dictate her dating life?\n\nLegally, there's no law against it since both are adults. Ethically, it's about consent and boundaries. If the mother and Joe are both adults and consensual, it's their choice. However, the son's feelings are valid, even if he's an adult. The mother might be in a position of influence regarding the band, which could raise questions about power dynamics, but if the relationship is mutual and there's no coercion, maybe not.\n\nThe key points are: both adults, consensual, son's reaction based on personal discomfort, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any ethical concern. Since she initiated the flyer, Joe joined the band, and the relationship started after that, and there's no indication of manipulation or coercion, the mother isn't in the wrong. The son's feelings are valid but not a moral fault on the mother's part.\n"
