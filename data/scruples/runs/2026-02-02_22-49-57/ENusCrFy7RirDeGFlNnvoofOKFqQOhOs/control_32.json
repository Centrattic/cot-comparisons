His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother dating her son's friend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. She's been a single mom since he was 17. Ben has been dealing with depression but is in therapy. He's introverted and lonely. He started a band with Joe, a 29-year-old colleague of the mom. The mom posted the flyer for the band, Joe came in, they connected, and he joined the band. Over time, the mom and Joe started talking more, and they ended up texting and bonding over work and music. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if she dated his friend Matt. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Dating a friend of your adult child. 2) The dynamic where the son is still young and may be vulnerable. 3) The mother's history of being single since his father left, which might make her more susceptible to forming a relationship quickly.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. From Ben's viewpoint, he might feel like his space is invaded. Even though Joe is his friend, the mother dating him could create tension. Ben is 21, which is an age where having a parent date someone close might be emotionally challenging. He might feel like there's a boundary being crossed, especially if he's still adjusting to his mother's role as a parent versus a person who can date.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's perspective is that she's a single parent, and Joe is a friend of her son who she met through work. They connected over work and the band, which initially was for Ben's benefit. The mother might feel that her relationship with Joe is separate from her son's. The age difference (mother 38, Joe 29) isn't too significant, but the power dynamic here is tricky because she's the mother of Joe's bandmate. Also, the way they met through work adds another layer of complexity, as they might be colleagues in some capacity.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for Ben to feel that his mother's relationship affects his social life and band dynamics. If the band is important to him, having his mother's new partner involved could cause issues. Also, the mother's decision to give Joe Ben's number without consulting him first might be a point of contention.\n\nLegally and socially, the mother is free to date whoever she wants, especially since she's an adult. However, the emotional impact on her son is a big factor here. If Ben is upset and this relationship causes him distress, the mother might need to consider his feelings. But since Ben is an adult, his feelings are important, but they shouldn't necessarily override her autonomy.\n\nThe key here is whether the mother acted inconsiderately. She didn't start the relationship with the intent to date Joe; it evolved naturally through work and Ben's band. However, once Ben found out and was upset, the mother might need to address his feelings. The question is whether she's in the wrong for pursuing a relationship that her son is uncomfortable with. Since Ben is an adult and capable of managing his own relationships, including with his friends, the mother's actions aren't inherently wrong. However, the situation could be seen as awkward or inappropriate if it's causing harm to Ben's emotional well-being.\n\nIn some cases, parents dating their adult child's friend can be a red flag if the child is still in a dependent state or hasn't fully separated emotionally. Ben is 21, which is young adulthood, but he's been dealing with depression and is introverted, which might make him more sensitive to such changes. The mother's role as a parent is to support Ben, so if her actions are undermining that, it could be problematic.\n\nOn the flip side, the mother has the right to her own life and happiness. It's possible that Ben's reaction is more about his own insecurities or the dynamics of their relationship rather than the mother's actions being inherently wrong. The mother might need to have an open conversation with Ben to understand his concerns and reassure him.\n\nIn summary, while there's no legal wrongdoing, the ethical or social aspect depends on the impact on Ben. If the mother is causing her son emotional distress without considering his feelings, she might be in the wrong. However, if she's acting in good faith and the relationship isn't directly affecting Ben's well-being, it's more of a gray area. The answer might hinge on whether the mother took Ben's feelings into account after the fact or if she dismissed them. Since she acknowledges Ben's feelings but thinks it's different from the hypothetical with Matt, there's a nuance here. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's trying to balance her own needs with her son's, but she needs to navigate the situation carefully. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that she should consider Ben's feelings more.\n"
