His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that a single mom, who's 38 and had her son Ben when she was 17, is now dating Joe, who is her son's friend. Ben is 21 and has been dealing with depression, so the mom is trying to help by getting him into a band again. She put up a flyer for the band at work, where Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, saw it and ended up joining the band. They were just colleagues in different departments and didn't really talk much before. \n\nThen, when Ben was late, the mom invited Joe in for coffee, they talked about work and the band, and Joe asked for her number. After that, they started texting a lot, and now Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend from middle school. The author is asking if they're the a**hole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mom didn't start this relationship because of Ben's friend; it started through Ben's band. But she did connect with Joe initially because he was Ben's friend. The key points here are the potential conflict of interest between her professional role at work and her personal life, and the possible impact on her relationship with her son.\n\nThe mom and Joe work in different departments, so maybe there's not a direct professional overlap. However, she introduced Joe to the band, which Ben is part of. If Joe is in the band with Ben and other students, the mom's role as a parent might be complicated by dating someone her son is close to. Ben is an adult now, 21, so he's not a minor, but the mom is still his parent. The concern is about Ben's feelings and the potential for a power imbalance or pressure.\n\nThe author sent Joe her phone number after he asked for it, and they started texting. Ben found out and is upset. The author argues it's different from Ben's friend from middle school, but the comparison is made. The main issue is whether the mom is in the wrong by dating her son's friend, especially when she might be in a position of influence over the band or Joe's involvement in it.\n\nIn some cases, dating a colleague can be an issue if it affects the workplace, but since they are in different departments, maybe that's less of a problem. However, the band is part of her son's life, and if Joe is a friend Ben is close to, the mom starting a relationship could make Ben feel uncomfortable or like boundaries are being crossed. The mom's responsibility as a parent is to prioritize her son's well-being, and if Ben is upset, that could be a sign that something is wrong from his perspective.\n\nAlso, the mom hasn't dated since she was with Ben's father, so maybe she's looking for a relationship and this is a new connection. But Ben is an adult, so while the relationship might be awkward, it's not necessarily illegal or unethical. However, the parent-child relationship is different from peer relationships. The mom might be overstepping if Joe's involvement in the band is due to her influence, and then she starts a relationship with him. Ben might feel like his mom is using her position or that the dynamic is inappropriate because of the generational gap and their roles.\n\nBut the mom's actions were initially for her son's benefit. She connected Joe to the band, which helped Ben. Now, the relationship between her and Joe is separate, but it's causing Ben distress. The question is about right and wrong, not just Ben's feelings. However, in these kinds of situations, the parent's actions can be considered wrong if they disregard the child's feelings without a valid reason. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of a gray area. The mom didn't act maliciously; she was trying to help her son. But the fact that Joe is part of Ben's circle and that the mom is now involved in a personal relationship with him might cross a boundary. Ben is an adult and has the right to feel uncomfortable, but the mom isn't in the wrong just because he's upset. However, the potential for favoritism or influence in the band's context could be an issue. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the mom is now in a relationship with a colleague and her son's friend, and Ben is an adult who is expressing his upset, the answer might depend on the specific circumstances. If there's no actual conflict of interest at work and the mom is being respectful of Ben's feelings, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's using her position to get involved with someone in her son's group, that's more problematic. The initial introduction was for Ben's benefit, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I need to check the details again. The mom gave Joe the number to help Ben's band, and then the personal relationship developed. If the mom is now dating someone her son is friends with, even if they are in different departments, it's possible that Ben feels betrayed or that the mom is overstepping. \n\nIn the end, it's more about Ben's feelings and the potential for the mom to be in a position where her professional and personal relationships could conflict. If there's no conflict at work, maybe it's okay. But the fact that Joe is part of her son's social circle complicates things. However, the author is not in the wrong necessarily because she's an adult and her son is also an adult. The answer is B.\n"
