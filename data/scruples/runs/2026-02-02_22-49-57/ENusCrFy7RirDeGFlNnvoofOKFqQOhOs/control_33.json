His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the key points: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single parent, and Ben has struggled with depression. She helped him start a band again, and Joe, a colleague in his 20s, joined. The mother and Joe started talking more, then began texting a lot, and Ben found out, feeling it's weird.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, there's the dynamic of a mother dating a friend of her adult son. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might still feel protective, and the son could feel uncomfortable since Joe is his friend. But the mother is single, hasn't dated since Ben's father, and maybe this is just her finding someone after being alone for so long.\n\nLegally, there's no issue since both are adults. But socially, it's a gray area. The son is an adult, so he can't really stop her from dating. However, the mother might be overstepping if the relationship affects Ben's comfort or if there's a power dynamic, like her being his mother and Joe being his friend. But Joe is also an adult, so he's making his own choices.\n\nThe mother's main justification is that she's helping her son and that Joe is part of the band. But when she started communicating with Joe beyond that, maybe she didn't consider Ben's feelings. However, Ben is 21, so he's old enough to handle his own friend relationships.\n\nIs the mother in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the mother didn't interfere in Ben's friendships and Joe is just a friend from the band, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the relationship causes discomfort for Ben, maybe she should consider his feelings. However, since Ben is an adult, it's his choice to be upset about it. The mother isn't doing anything illegal, and it's her right to date. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
