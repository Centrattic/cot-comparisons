His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author had her son at 17, single mom, son is 21 now. He's been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, and they posted a flyer at her workplace. A colleague, Joe (29), saw it, joined the band. Joe became part of the son's circle. Then, when the son was late, the author invited Joe for coffee. They talked, Joe asked for her number to send a song, and they started texting. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, I need to consider the dynamics here. The son is 21, an adult. The author is his mother, but he's not a minor. However, there's a potential for a conflict of interest or discomfort in the family dynamic. The son might feel like his friend is being appropriated, which can be awkward. But since both the author and Joe are adults, their relationship is technically their own business. However, the fact that the author was initially the one who connected them because of the son's band complicates things. The son might feel betrayed because his mother is dating one of his friends, which could affect their relationship. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference between the author (38) and Joe (29), it's not a massive gap, but the mother-son dynamic is key here. Even though the son is an adult, the mother's relationship with his friend could create tension. The son's reaction is valid because he's concerned about the situation. However, the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong from a legal or ethical standpoint since she's an adult. But socially, it's a bit of a sticky situation. \n\nThe author might have overstepped by pursuing a relationship with someone linked to her son, even if the son is an adult. The son's feelings need to be considered, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her son's feelings over her own. However, the son's well-being is important, and if this affects their relationship, that's a factor. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about the perception and the potential consequences. The author isn't \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, but there's a social awkwardness here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because both are adults, but some might argue that the mother should consider her son's feelings more. Still, the line between being wrong and just socially awkward isn't clear. The key is that the son is an adult, so the author isn't doing something inherently wrong by dating an adult. However, the situation is complicated and could be seen as crossing a boundary. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in the scenario, the son is 21, so he's an adult. The mother's relationship with his friend might not be the mother's fault per se. She didn't set out to date his friend; it happened after the friend became part of the band. So maybe she isn't in the wrong. The answer could be B. But the son's feelings are valid, but that doesn't make her wrong. The question is whether she is in the wrong. Since there's no legal or moral wrong, just a social awkwardness, the answer is B.\n"
