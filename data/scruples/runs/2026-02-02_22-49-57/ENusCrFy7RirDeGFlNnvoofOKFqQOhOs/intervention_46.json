His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a single mother who started dating her son's friend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She had him at 17, so she's been a single parent. Ben's been dealing with depression and is introverted. He was in a band but it fell apart. The mother suggested he start a band again, and they put up flyers. Her colleague Joe saw the flyer, auditioned, and became part of the band. Initially, Joe was just a colleague, but they started talking more, and eventually, they started dating. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me consider factors here.\n\nFirst, the mother's intentions. She was trying to help her son by getting him back into the band. She met Joe through this, which seems like a natural connection. They bonded over the band and work. Then, their relationship developed beyond that. But Ben is 21, an adult, so this is about adult relationships. The mother was single for a long time, which might explain her feelings.\n\nBut Ben is her son, so there's a potential for family tension. However, since Ben is an adult, he should have his own boundaries. The mother isn't dating someone who is a direct friend in a personal circle\u2014Joe is part of the band, which Ben chose to involve himself with. The mother didn't intentionally set out to date Joe; it evolved naturally after meeting through work and the band.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that dating a friend of your adult child could create awkwardness, but it's not inherently wrong. The main issue is Ben's reaction. The mother is an adult too, and her relationships are her own. The fact that Ben is upset is understandable, but it's his issue to process. The mother isn't violating any laws or strict social norms. Unless there's a conflict of interest at work, which isn't mentioned here, there's no clear wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't acting in the wrong. She's navigating her own life and forming a relationship that's separate from her role as a mother, even if it's with someone connected to her son. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
