His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a mother of a 21-year-old son, Ben, who starts dating Joe, a 29-year-old colleague and friend of Ben. The key points here are the relationships and the dynamics.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, Ben is 21. Joe is 29. The mother and Joe started interacting because Ben wanted to form a band. Joe joined the band, and then their relationship progressed to the mother and Joe dating. The son is upset because his mother is dating his friend. The mother argues it's different from dating a friend like Matt from middle school because Joe is part of the band and not as close as a lifelong friend.\n\nNow, considering the age differences: the mother is 38, Joe is 29. Ben is 21. So the mother is Ben's age. The age gap between mother and Joe is 9 years, which is common. But Ben is the one who's upset because it's his friend. The mother's actions could be seen as inappropriate if there's a conflict of interest, but since Joe is Ben's friend and not an employee directly under her supervision, maybe not. However, they do work at the same place, so there could be workplace concerns if they start a romantic relationship. \n\nAnother angle is Ben's emotional state. He's been dealing with depression and loneliness. If the mother's relationship with Joe affects Ben's well-being, that's a concern. But Ben is an adult, so he should have some autonomy. The mother's actions might not be wrong if she's acting on her own agency, but she needs to consider her son's feelings. \n\nThe mother initiated contact by giving Joe Ben's number, which could be seen as facilitating the band, but then she ended up involved with Joe. The question is whether she overstepped by getting involved with someone her son considers a friend. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the key is whether the mother did something inherently wrong. Since both she and Joe are adults, their relationship isn't illegal. However, the ethical consideration is about respecting Ben's feelings and maintaining boundaries. If Ben is upset and it's causing tension, the mother might need to consider his feelings more, but she's not necessarily in the wrong unless she violated some explicit rule (like workplace policies) or harmed Ben directly. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because it's their personal choices as adults, but there's a consideration for Ben's feelings. However, depending on the perspective, some might say she should have been more cautious to avoid making Ben uncomfortable. But overall, since it's a personal relationship and not against any rules, B seems plausible.\n"
