His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a single mom of a 21-year-old son, Ben. The son is in a band with a friend named Joe, who's 29. The author started talking to Joe at work, gave him Ben's number for the band. Then Joe ended up joining the band. The author ended up talking a lot with Joe, and now they're texting, which Ben found out and is upset about, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. Ben is an adult now, 21. He's been dealing with depression, and the author has been supportive. The band was a way to help him. Joe is part of the band and a friend. The author and Joe started talking when they were colleagues, and their conversation led to a relationship. But the issue is that Ben is upset because his mom is dating his friend.\n\nSo, the key points here: Ben is an adult. The author is his mother but also now has a relationship with his friend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's look at possible angles.\n\nIs there a conflict of interest because the author and Joe work together? The author gave Joe Ben's number, which led to him joining the band. But the problem isn't about the band; it's about the mother-son dynamic. The author might be in a position of influence over Ben's life, especially since Ben has been struggling. However, Ben is an adult, so maybe the author isn't in a supervisory role anymore. The author is dealing with her own loneliness and hasn't dated in years. Starting a relationship with Joe is her personal choice.\n\nBut the issue is that Ben is now upset. The author is his mother, so there's an inherent power dynamic. If the author starts a relationship with someone close to Ben, even though Ben is an adult, it could make him feel uncomfortable or that his personal space is being invaded. However, the author didn't explicitly start the relationship with the intention to hurt Ben. It's more of an organic progression. The author's main focus was to support Ben, and Joe became part of that support system indirectly.\n\nAnother angle: the author and Joe started talking because of work and the band. Their relationship developed beyond the initial context of the band. The author might not have considered Ben's feelings, but Ben is an adult who can handle his own emotions. The mother might feel she has the right to date whom she wants, especially since she's a single parent and hasn't dated in a while. However, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend could create tension. Ben might feel like his mother is overstepping, especially since there's a history of depression and reliance on her.\n\nBut Ben is 21. He's supposed to be independent. The author's relationship with Joe isn't directly interfering with Ben's life unless Ben's mental health is being affected. The user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong. The key factors here are whether the author's actions are harmful, and if Ben's reaction is valid. The author didn't force Joe into the band or start the relationship to manipulate Ben. The author might have a right to her own happiness. However, the mother-son relationship is unique, and the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary. But since Ben is an adult, it's a matter of personal boundaries and communication. The author might need to consider Ben's feelings but isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
