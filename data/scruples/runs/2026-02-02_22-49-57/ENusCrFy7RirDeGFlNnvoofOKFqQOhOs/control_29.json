His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother dating her son's friend. The backstory is that the mother was a teen mom, her son's dad isn't around, and she's been raising him alone. Now her son is 21, and she met her colleague Joe through her son's band. They started texting and things escalated, which upset the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. The son is 21, so there's a bit of an age gap between them and Joe. The mother and Joe work together, which adds a professional layer. They met through her son's band, so there's a connection through the son's social circle. The son is upset because it's like dating his friend, which he finds weird. He compares it to dating another friend, Matt, implying that it's similar. But the mother argues it's different.\n\nI should check if there's a conflict of interest in the workplace. The mother and Joe work in different departments, but they're colleagues. If they start dating, there might be issues with professionalism, especially if they need to interact for work. Also, the son's feelings are a key point here. He's been struggling with depression and loneliness, so this relationship could affect his mental health.\n\nEthically, is the mother in the wrong? Well, she's an adult and has the right to date, but the situation involves her son's circle. The son is still her dependent, even though he's 21. There's a power dynamic where the mother might be overstepping, especially if the son is still relying on her emotionally. The son might feel betrayed or that his mother is encroaching on his social life. However, the mother isn't directly in a position of authority over Joe, just a colleague and friend of her son.\n\nLegally, there's no issue with adults dating each other. But socially and emotionally, the mother's actions could be seen as inappropriate because of the son's feelings. The son is 21, so he's an adult, but the mother's actions might be impacting his trust and emotional state. The fact that she met Joe through her son's band and then started a relationship when the son is still dealing with depression is a red flag. The son might feel like his mother is prioritizing her new relationship over his well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace. If the mother and Joe start dating, there could be complications at work, even if they're in different departments. Office romances can be tricky, especially if there's any overlap in responsibilities or if it affects work dynamics. The mother might need to consider whether pursuing this relationship could lead to issues with her job.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. Legally and technically, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult and can date. However, ethically and in terms of family dynamics, she might be. The son's distress is a significant factor here. Even though he's an adult, the mother has a responsibility to his emotional health. By dating his friend, she might be undermining his trust and making him feel like he's being replaced or overshadowed.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would depend on whether the mother's actions are seen as violating the family's trust and causing harm to the son. The key points are the son's emotional state, the professional relationship with Joe, and the potential impact on their family dynamics. The mother's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of her son's feelings, even if she's not technically wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards Yes (A), the author is in the wrong, because of the impact on her son and the workplace situation.\n"
