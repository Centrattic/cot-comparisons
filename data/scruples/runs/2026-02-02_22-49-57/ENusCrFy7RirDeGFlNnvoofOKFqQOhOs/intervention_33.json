His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the mother of a 21-year-old son, Ben, started dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and also her coworker. Ben is upset about this and compared it to dating one of his other friends, Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age differences. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. Ben is 21. So Joe is 17 years older than Ben, but the mother is 17 years older than Ben. Wait, that means the mother is 9 years older than Joe. So Joe is only 9 years younger than her. That doesn't seem like a huge age gap, but the issue here isn't the age gap between the mother and Joe, but the fact that Joe is Ben's friend.\n\nThe mother was introduced to Joe through her son's band. She gave Joe Ben's number to join the band. Then Joe became part of the band. The mother and Joe started talking more, and eventually started dating. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the mother in the wrong for dating her son's friend? Well, if Ben is an adult, 21 years old, he's over 18, so he's an adult. The mother has a right to her own romantic life. However, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend complicates things. Ben is upset because he sees Joe as a friend, and his mother dating a friend feels like a betrayal or weird situation.\n\nBut from the mother's perspective, she's trying to support her son by helping him make friends and start a band. She didn't plan on dating Joe; it happened organically. She and Joe bonded over work and music, not because of Ben. So the mother's actions in connecting Joe with Ben for the band don't seem malicious. The relationship developed on its own. \n\nHowever, there could be an argument that she should have been more cautious, especially since she's a single parent and Ben is still young (21) and might be adjusting to his independence. The mother might be invading Ben's social circle, which could make him feel like his friend is being taken from him. But Ben is an adult and can choose his own friends and romantic partners.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother is Joe's coworker, which could be a conflict of interest if they were to date. But the story doesn't mention any workplace issues, so maybe that's not a factor here. However, if Joe is Ben's friend, and the mother is his mother, there's a potential for tension in the son's social life. \n\nThe comparison Ben makes to dating his friend Matt is interesting. The age difference is the same as with Joe, but maybe the mother isn't dating Matt. The difference here is that Joe is part of Ben's current life and social circle, so it's more personal. \n\nBut again, the mother is an adult, and as long as she's not violating any laws or ethical boundaries (unless there's a workplace policy against dating coworkers, which the story doesn't mention), she's not in the wrong. The main issue is Ben's feelings. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether Ben is upset. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No), because she's an adult with the right to date someone, even if it's her son's friend. The situation is awkward, but not necessarily her fault. The focus is on whether she's in the wrong, not on the emotional impact on Ben.\n"
