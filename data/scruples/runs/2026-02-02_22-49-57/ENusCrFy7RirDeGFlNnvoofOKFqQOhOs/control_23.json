His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother dating her son's friend, who also happens to be a colleague. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21, and Joe is 29. They met through the band Ben started. Initially, Joe was just a friend of Ben's, and the mother met him through work. The key points here are the relationships involved and possible conflicts.\n\nThe son, Ben, is dealing with depression and has been isolated, so forming the band was a positive for him. The mother helped bring Joe into the band, which improved Ben's social circle. Now, the mother is dating Joe, which upsets Ben. He compares it to dating someone else's friend, which can be awkward. But there's also a work relationship here\u2014Joe is her colleague. Dating a colleague could have workplace implications, like favoritism or conflicts of interest.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother and son have a parent-child relationship, which is a close and lasting bond. By dating her son's friend, the mother might be encroaching on Ben's social circle in a way that could make him feel uncomfortable. Ben is an adult, but it's possible he's still adjusting to his mother having her own life and relationships outside of their shared history.\n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated in a long time, so this could be a genuine connection for her. However, the son's reaction is valid because it's a new and potentially uncomfortable situation for him. The mother should consider Ben's feelings and whether this relationship could affect their relationship or his mental health.\n\nThere are also workplace ethics to consider. If they start dating, there might be issues with professionalism, especially if they work in the same company. However, the story doesn't mention any immediate workplace problems, just that they work in different departments.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The mother has the right to pursue her happiness, but she needs to navigate the potential fallout with her son and workplace. Since Ben is an adult, he should be able to handle this, but his upset reaction indicates he's not fully comfortable. The mother might need to address both her son's feelings and any workplace policies about dating colleagues.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the key here is whether the mother is in the wrong. If she didn't intentionally disregard Ben's feelings and considered the implications, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she didn't take Ben's perspective into account, she might be. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she's an adult with the right to date, but there are valid concerns from Ben's side. However, the situation requires sensitivity from both sides.\n"
