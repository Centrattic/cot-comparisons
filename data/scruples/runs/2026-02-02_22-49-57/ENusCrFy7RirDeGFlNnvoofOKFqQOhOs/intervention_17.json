His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who's been a single parent since she was 17. Her son Ben is 21, has dealt with depression, and is part of a band with Joe, a 29-year-old colleague of the mother. The mother and Joe started talking at work, he joined Ben's band, and later they developed a relationship. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's intentions were probably to help her son by connecting him with someone who could help with the band. She didn't set out to date Joe initially. The relationship started after a casual conversation at work, and they bonded over work stress and the band. The key points here are consent and the son's feelings. \n\nBen is 21, an adult, so he can handle his own relationships. The mother's relationship with Joe isn't directly affecting Ben's life beyond the social aspect. However, Ben might feel protective of his friends or see it as a conflict of interest if they were close. But since the mother is his mother, maybe there's a different dynamic. \n\nThe mother's age is 38, and Joe is 29. They're both adults. The mother hasn't dated in a long time, so this might be a genuine connection for her. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's nothing illegal here. Socially, it's a bit awkward because of the son's relationship with Joe, but not inherently wrong. The mother didn't do anything to harm Ben; she's trying to be involved in his life. \n\nHowever, the main issue is Ben's reaction. He feels it's weird, comparing it to \"what if you dated Matt,\" implying that if it were his other friend, it would be different. But the mother isn't dating Matt, and she's the one who initiated contact with Joe. \n\nI think the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices, and Ben's feelings are valid but not a reason to be in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
