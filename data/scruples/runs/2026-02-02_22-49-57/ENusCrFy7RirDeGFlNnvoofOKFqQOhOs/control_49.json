His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mom who had her son at 17. Now he's 21, and she's 38. Her son Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, and he made a flyer which she posted at her workplace. Joe, her 29-year-old colleague, saw it, joined Ben's band, and they became friends. Then the author met Joe, they talked about work and the band, and eventually started texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author feels it's different but wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether a mother dating her son's friend is wrong. There are a few factors here. Age-wise, the author is 38, Joe is 29, and Ben is 21. They're all adults now. The author has been a single parent, so maybe her dating life is a new area for her. Ben is upset because it's similar to dating his friend from middle school, Matt. But the author argues it's different.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, since everyone is an adult, there's no law against it. However, there's a social taboo aspect. The mother-son relationship could be strained if the son feels his parent is encroaching on his social circle. Ben's reaction shows he's concerned about his mother's relationship with his friend. The author might have not considered Ben's feelings enough. She started communicating with Joe in a romantic way after meeting him, which could be seen as moving too quickly after he's part of her son's close circle.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the author isn't Ben's legal guardian anymore since he's 21. The decision to date is hers, but it's about the potential conflict of interest, especially since Joe works at her workplace. There's also the question of boundaries. Did she cross a line by getting involved with someone her son is friends with? It might be seen as inappropriate because it could affect their relationship dynamics. However, if Ben is an adult, he should respect her autonomy in choosing her relationships, even if it's with someone he considers a friend.\n\nThe key points are consent, age, and the impact on family dynamics. Since everyone is an adult and there's no coercion, it's more of a judgment call. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are seen as respecting her son's feelings while also being within her right to date. The son's upset is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. However, she might need to consider Ben's feelings and maybe address the situation openly to prevent further conflict. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because it's about adult autonomy, though there's room for her to handle it more sensitively.\n"
