His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves the mother, her son Ben, and a colleague friend of Ben's named Joe. The mother is 38, Ben is 21, and Joe is 29. The mother initially helped Ben connect with Joe for a band, and then a relationship developed between her and Joe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is single and has been a single parent since Ben was 17. Now that Ben is 21, he's an adult, but they've had a close relationship, especially with him dealing with depression. The mother might feel lonely and has been dating someone since her son's father left. The key point is that the mother is forming a new relationship with someone who is her son's friend, which Ben finds upsetting.\n\nNow, is the mother in the wrong? Well, Ben is an adult. He's 21, so he's legally an adult and capable of forming his own opinions and relationships. The mother's relationship with Joe could be seen as a personal choice, especially since Ben is old enough to handle friendships and relationships independently. However, Ben might feel that his mother encroaching into his friend's social circle is intrusive or awkward. But the mother didn't date the friend to interfere with Ben; it seems a natural progression of her social life. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a boundary issue. The mother introduced Joe to Ben for the band, so there's a connection there. But since Ben is an adult, he can't control his mother's dating life. The mother's actions aren't wrong just because her son is upset. The question is more about whether the mother did something unethical or harmful. She didn't manipulate or take advantage; she formed a relationship organically. Joe was a colleague and became friends with Ben through the band, then the mother and Joe developed a relationship. There's no indication of coercion or inappropriate pressure.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the mother is not in the wrong. I agree. The mother is pursuing her own happiness, which is a valid right. Ben, as an adult, might need to adjust to his mother having her own life and relationships. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
