His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38 and her son Ben is 21. Ben's father wasn't around, so she's been a single mom. Ben has been dealing with depression and was in a band that disbanded. The mom suggested he start a new band and made flyers. She posted one at work where a colleague, Joe (29), saw it. They talked, Joe joined the band. The mom found herself talking more to Joe, and eventually they started dating. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mom met Joe through her son's band. They started as colleagues, then became friends through the band. The mom and Joe started a relationship after some casual interactions. The son is upset because it's similar to dating a friend's friend. But Ben's friend is also his bandmate, so the dynamics might be different. The mom hasn't dated in a long time since Ben's father, which might be a factor.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The main ethical issues here could be the relationship with a colleague, but the mom and Joe were in different departments and hadn't interacted much before. Also, the fact that Joe is a friend of her son complicates things. The son's perspective is that it's weird, similar to dating a close friend. But Ben's friends are his peers, so the mom is an adult and Joe is 29, which is close to Ben's age. However, the mom is Ben's parent, so there's a natural authority there. \n\nAnother angle is whether the mom's actions could affect her son's relationships. If Ben feels uncomfortable, it's important to consider his feelings. But the mom might not be in the wrong if she's an adult and Joe is a colleague and friend. The question is about the morality or rightness of the situation. \n\nIn some cases, relationships between an adult parent and someone who is a friend of their adult child can be problematic, depending on the context. However, since both the mom and Joe are adults, and if the relationship is consensual and not affecting Ben's well-being, it might not be the mom's fault. But Ben is still adjusting, and the mom should consider his feelings. However, the mom isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's her life and she's an adult. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're both adults, the relationship started after mutual interactions, and while it's awkward, it's not inherently wrong. The son's reaction is about his discomfort, but the mother's actions don't seem malicious. The key is that they're both adults and the mother has the right to date.\n"
