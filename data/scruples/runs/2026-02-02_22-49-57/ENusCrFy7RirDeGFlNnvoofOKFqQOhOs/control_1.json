His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother (the author) whose son is 21 and has a friend named Joe, who is 29. They ended up dating after connecting through the son's band project.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 38, and the son is 21, so the son is an adult. The son's friend Joe is 29, so he's also an adult. The author and Joe started communicating after meeting at work, and they've been texting. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the key points. The son is an adult, so he's capable of making his own decisions and handling his feelings. The author isn't a minor, so there's no legal issue here. The main concern might be the son's feelings, but since he's an adult, it's more about his emotional reaction rather than any actual harm. The author and Joe are both adults, so their relationship is consensual and legal. The fact that they met through the son's band and work might complicate things, but they're both adults making their own choices.\n\nThe son's reaction is about feeling it's weird, similar to dating his friend. But the author isn't the friend; she's the mother. However, she's dating the friend, not the son. There's no direct parent-child romantic relationship here. The issue is the son's discomfort, but he's an adult with his own autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with an adult who is her son's friend. The son can express his feelings, but the author isn't obligated to stop dating if both parties are consenting adults.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say it's inappropriate because of the son's feelings, but since the son is an adult, it's more about his emotional response rather than a violation. The author didn't force the relationship; it developed naturally. There's no coercion or manipulation mentioned. The relationship isn't interfering with the son's life beyond his emotional reaction. The author might need to consider the son's feelings, but she isn't in the wrong for pursuing a legitimate relationship with an adult.\n\nAnother angle: The mother's relationship with Joe could potentially affect the son's social life, but the son is an adult and can handle his own friendships. The mother isn't removing Joe from the son's life, just dating him. The main conflict is the son's discomfort, which is a personal issue, not something the mother is responsible for. The mother isn't violating any social norms in a way that makes her wrong; it's a situation where adult relationships can be complicated but not inherently wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
