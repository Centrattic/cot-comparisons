His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a single mother who started dating her son's friend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She raised him alone since he was 17. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. He formed a band with Joe, who is 29. Joe works with the mom and became part of the band. The mom initially met Joe through Ben's band, and they started talking, then texting. Ben found out and is upset because he thinks it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend since middle school.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The mom and Joe are colleagues, which adds a professional element. Even though they work in different departments, there's a potential conflict of interest or workplace issues if they date. Also, Ben is an adult, so his feelings matter, but he's not a child anymore. The mom is single and hasn't dated in a while, so she's looking for a relationship. However, dating someone connected to her adult son might create tension. \n\nThe main ethical issues here are the workplace relationship and the dynamic with her son. If the mom and Joe are colleagues, dating could lead to problems at work, like favoritism or awkward situations. Also, Ben's discomfort is valid because it's his friend. Even though he's an adult, the mother should consider his feelings. However, since Ben is 21, he's legally an adult, and the mother isn't his guardian in terms of relationships. \n\nBut the key point is whether it's wrong. The answer might depend on the workplace policies. If they are in the same company, dating a colleague is often discouraged or prohibited. That could make the mom in the wrong. Additionally, the son's relationship with Joe is through the band, so the mom's dating Joe might affect Ben's trust or comfort. \n\nHowever, the mom hasn't done anything against the law, just a social and professional situation. The answer might hinge on whether the workplace has a policy against dating colleagues. If they do, then yes, she's in the wrong. If not, maybe not. But generally, workplace relationships can be problematic. Also, Ben's feelings should be respected even though he's an adult. The mother should have considered that before getting involved.\n\nSo, considering the workplace aspect and Ben's feelings, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong), but if the workplace allows such relationships, maybe B. However, since the user hasn't mentioned any specific workplace policy, the general assumption is that it's a problem. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
