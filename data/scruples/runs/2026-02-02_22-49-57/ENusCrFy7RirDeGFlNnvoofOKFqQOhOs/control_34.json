His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a single mother, who's been raising her son Ben since he was 17, ends up dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and also a colleague. Ben is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and son have a close relationship since she's been a single parent. Ben is 21, an adult, but he's been dealing with depression and is introverted. The mother's intention was to help him make friends by suggesting a band, which led to Joe joining. Initially, the mother and Joe interacted professionally at work, but then their relationship evolved into a personal one when they started texting. \n\nThe main issue is whether dating a son's friend is wrong. There's a potential conflict of interest if they work together, especially since their relationship could affect the workplace environment. Also, there's Ben's feelings to consider. He's an adult, so he has the right to be upset, but the mother is also an adult who deserves to date. However, Ben might feel like his privacy or trust is being invaded, especially if the mother didn't consider his perspective beforehand.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. While it's not a huge gap, it's still a parent-son dynamic. But Ben is 21, so he's not a child anymore. The mother might be overstepping if she didn't communicate her intentions with Ben first. The fact that Ben compared it to dating his friend Matt since middle school might highlight the closeness he feels towards Joe, making the situation more sensitive.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. Even if they're not in the same department, the fact that they work at the same place could lead to complications. The mother gave Joe Ben's number, which could be seen as a breach of trust if she didn't ask Ben first. But she did get Ben's number from him, so maybe it's okay.\n\nBen's reaction is valid because he might feel uncomfortable with his mother dating his friend. It's a personal relationship that could affect their dynamic. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's honest and respects Ben's feelings, but she should have considered his perspective before pursuing the relationship. Since Ben is an adult, he has the right to his feelings, but the mother isn't obligated to stop dating Joe unless there are other factors like workplace policies.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because both she and Ben are adults, and she has the right to date. However, she should have been more sensitive to Ben's feelings and maybe discussed it with him first. The main issue is the potential workplace conflict and Ben's emotional response. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that she should handle it carefully.\n"
