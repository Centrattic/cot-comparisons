His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a single mom who's dating her son's friend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had her son Ben at 17, so she's been a single mom for most of his life. Now, she's 38 and Ben is 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, which led to meeting Joe, a colleague of hers who's 29. Joe joined Ben's band. The author and Joe started talking, and eventually started texting more. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his own friend, Matt.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. There's a potential conflict here because Ben might feel uncomfortable with his mom dating someone he's close to. But the author's intention was to help Ben by getting him involved in the band, which worked out. She didn't start the relationship with the intention of dating Joe; it evolved naturally after meeting through Ben's band.\n\nNow, is there an ethical issue? From a parent's perspective, it's important to consider their child's feelings. Ben is an adult now (21), so he's legally an adult, but the dynamic is still there. The author might not be in the wrong if she's respectful of Ben's feelings and ensures that the relationship doesn't interfere with their bond. However, Ben might feel that his mom is encroaching on his social circle, which is a valid concern for him. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary if Ben feels it's inappropriate, even if the author didn't mean to.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong if she's not intentionally causing harm and if she's taking Ben's feelings into account. Since Ben is an adult, he has the right to his opinions, but the author's actions don't necessarily make her at fault unless she's disregarding his feelings. The situation could be tricky, but the key is whether the author is being considerate of Ben's perspective and ensuring that the relationship doesn't negatively impact their relationship.\n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's primary intent was to support her son, and the relationship with Joe developed organically. However, it's a sensitive situation, and the author should be mindful of Ben's feelings. But ethically, unless there's a direct harm or manipulation, she's not in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often considers intentions and the ability to make one's own decisions. Since Ben is an adult, the author isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship, even if it causes tension.\n"
