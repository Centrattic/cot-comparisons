His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the scenario is at fault for dating their son's friend. The story is that the mother, who's been a single parent, helped her son start a band, which led to her connecting with Joe, a colleague. They started talking, and eventually, she began dating him. The son, Ben, found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his own friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors. The mother's intentions were to help her son, which is positive. She facilitated Joe's involvement in the band, which was good for Ben's social life. The relationship between mom and Joe started as a professional interaction but evolved into a personal one. The main issue here is the social dynamics with her son. \n\nBen is 21, an adult, so he might have his own feelings about his mom dating someone he's close to. The mother's actions weren't malicious; she didn't intentionally set out to date Joe. The problem arises from Ben's perspective, seeing it as weird or intrusive. \n\nI should also think about boundaries. The mother isn't in a position of authority over Joe, but she is Ben's parent. There's a potential conflict of interest here because Ben is upset, which could affect the family dynamics. However, the mother isn't forcing Joe to be in the band or to date her. She's pursuing her own happiness, which is valid, especially considering her long history as a single parent.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace connection. They met at work, but the relationship isn't necessarily work-related since they met through the band. Still, if they're colleagues, there might be workplace policies to consider, but the question is more about personal relationships rather than professional ethics.\n\nThe son's reaction is also important. He's comparing it to dating his own friend, which is a different dynamic. However, the mother isn't dating his friend per se; she's dating someone he's friends with. The line between parent and friend can be blurry here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date. However, she might need to be sensitive to her son's feelings. The key is whether her actions were manipulative or if she overstepped. In this case, she didn't seem to do that. She acted in good faith to help her son, and the relationship with Joe developed naturally from there. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. The situation is more about differing perspectives and the son's discomfort rather than any wrongdoing on the mother's part.\n"
