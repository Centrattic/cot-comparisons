His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (a 38-year-old single mother) is in the wrong for dating her son Ben's friend Joe, who is 29. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother had Ben at 17, so she's been a single parent. Ben is 21, dealing with depression but improving. He's introverted, and the mother helped him start a band by putting up a flyer. Joe, a colleague, saw the flyer, joined the band, and now the mother and Joe are dating, which upset Ben.\n\nSo, the main points here. The mother's intentions: She wanted to help her son make friends and be happy through the band. She didn't plan to date Joe. The connection between them developed naturally after work interactions, starting with supporting her son's project. She even gave Joe Ben's contact info, not hers. The dating started after some casual interactions at home and work, and Ben found out and is upset.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Is it wrong for a mother to date her son's friend? From a social standpoint, relationships between adults and their children's friends can be tricky because of potential conflicts of interest, especially in family dynamics. However, both the mother and Joe are adults, and their relationship developed outside of the work context (though they are colleagues, but the band is a separate social circle). The mother's primary motivation was to support her son, and the relationship with Joe wasn't her initial intent.\n\nBen's reaction is understandable\u2014he might feel uncomfortable with his friend being part of his personal life, especially with his mom. But the mother isn't necessarily at fault here. She's allowed to form relationships with other adults, even if they're friends of her children. The key factors are that both are consenting adults, the mother's actions were initially to help her son, and there's no indication of manipulation or coercion. The conflict arises more from Ben's perspective and his feelings of awkwardness rather than the mother's wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle: workplace relationships. The mother and Joe work in different departments but are colleagues. If they start dating, there could be HR implications, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing rather than professional conduct. The user hasn't mentioned any workplace policies violated yet, so that's probably not the focus here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong. She's an adult pursuing a relationship with another adult, even if it's with her son's friend. The son's feelings are valid, but they don't make her wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
