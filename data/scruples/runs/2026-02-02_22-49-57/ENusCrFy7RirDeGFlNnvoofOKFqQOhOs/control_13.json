His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a single mom who's 38, her son Ben is 21. He's been dealing with depression, and the mother has been supportive. Ben started a band again, and Joe, a colleague of the mother (29 years old), joined the band. Initially, the mother and Joe just had a professional relationship, but they started talking more, especially when Ben was late. They ended up texting a lot, and now Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird and similar to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationships and the dynamics. The mother and Joe met through Ben's band. They started as colleagues, then interacted more because of Ben's project. The mother, who hasn't dated in a long time, developed a connection with Joe, which Ben is now objecting to. \n\nI need to consider if there's a conflict of interest or if it's inappropriate given the context. The mother was Ben's primary caregiver when he was younger, but now Ben is an adult. However, the mother is entering a relationship with someone who is Ben's peer and friend. The line here is about the mother-son relationship and the social dynamics. \n\nIn many cultures, boundaries between parents and their adult children's friends can be sensitive. Even though Ben is 21 and an adult, the fact that he's the one who introduced them through the band might create a sense of discomfort. However, the mother and Joe are both adults, and the relationship started after Ben was already an adult. The mother didn't date Joe when Ben was younger, which might mitigate some issues. \n\nBut Ben's reaction suggests that he's upset, possibly feeling that his friend is being taken from him or that their dynamic is changing. The comparison to dating \"Matt\" (his friend since middle school) isn't exactly the same because Joe is involved in the band that Ben is part of, and the mother has a more direct role in connecting them. \n\nLegally and morally, there's no law against a parent dating a friend of their adult child. However, the ethical aspect is more about the impact on the family dynamics. If the mother and Joe are both adults and the relationship is consensual, it's their choice. But the mother needs to consider her son's feelings and how this might affect their relationship. \n\nThe mother hasn't done anything to prevent Ben from being with Joe before this, so the relationship wasn't forced. The conflict arises now because Ben feels it's weird. The mother's intention was to support her son's interests, which is positive, but now she's in a romantic relationship with someone connected to that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices. However, she should be sensitive to Ben's feelings. The answer would depend on whether the mother's actions are considered overstepping given the context of their past relationship. Since Ben is an adult and can handle his own friendships, the mother isn't violating any strict rules. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a social aspect to consider. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, which could be a judgment on social norms versus actual wrongdoing. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The mother isn't in the wrong for dating Joe, but she should communicate well with her son to address his concerns. The situation is a bit complex, but there's no clear ethical violation. The mother's actions are her own, and Ben needs to adjust to the fact that his mother is an adult with her own life now.\n"
