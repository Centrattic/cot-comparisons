His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The story is about a single mom who's been helping her son start a band. She met Joe, a colleague, through the band flyer. They ended up in the band together. Then, when the son was late, she invited Joe over for coffee, and they started texting a lot. The son found out and got upset.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is an adult, and Joe is a colleague but not her son's close friend. The son is 21, so an adult too. The mother hasn't dated in a while, and now she's connecting with Joe. The son is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. But maybe the difference is that Joe is part of the band and not as close as Matt.\n\nBut the key points are about boundaries. As a parent, when a child is still in their 20s, even if they're adults, there might be an expectation of certain boundaries. However, the son is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The mother's relationship with Joe was initiated through socializing, not through the son. She didn't interfere with the band; she facilitated it. The conflict here is between the mother and son's expectations. The mother might be within her rights to date someone her son is friends with, as long as it's consensual and not manipulative. The son's reaction is understandable, but it's his issue to deal with, not necessarily the mother's wrongdoing. So, the answer might be that the mother isn't in the wrong. But I need to check for any potential issues like workplace relationships. If Joe is a colleague, maybe there's a workplace policy against dating, but the story doesn't mention that. Also, the mother didn't date Joe because of the son, but through her own social interaction. So, probably answer B.\n"
