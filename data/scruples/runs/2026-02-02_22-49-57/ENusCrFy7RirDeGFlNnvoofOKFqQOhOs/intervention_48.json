His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the mother) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. \n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom who raised Ben from when he was 17. Now Ben is 21 and dealing with depression, which she's tried to help with therapy. The mother is 38, so there's a 17-year age gap between her and Joe, who is 29. \n\nShe met Joe through Ben's band. Initially, it was just to help Ben make friends, but then she and Joe started talking more. They developed a connection, and now Ben is upset because he found out they've been texting. He compares it to dating a close friend, but the mother thinks it's different.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference, the relationship with the son, and Ben's potential feelings of betrayal or discomfort. The mother's actions were initially to help her son, but now she's forming a relationship with someone her son knows. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to consider Ben's feelings. Even if the mother's intentions are good, dating the son's friend could create tension. However, the mother isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond the social dynamics. The age difference might be a factor, but it's not a legal issue here. \n\nThe mother's right to her own relationships is a factor too. She hasn't been dating for a while and is exploring a connection. The main conflict is the son's emotional reaction. It's a sensitive situation, but the mother isn't technically at fault for wanting to date someone new. However, she might need to navigate the situation carefully to minimize harm to her relationship with Ben. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother isn't \"in the wrong\" legally or morally, but she needs to be empathetic towards Ben's feelings. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as the situation is more about social and emotional dynamics rather than a clear ethical violation.\n"
