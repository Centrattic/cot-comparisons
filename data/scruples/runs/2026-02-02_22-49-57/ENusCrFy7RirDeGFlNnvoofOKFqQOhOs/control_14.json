His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a single mother since she was 17, so she's had a tough time raising Ben alone. Now Ben is 21, dealing with depression but getting better. He's introverted, so he's lonely. The mother suggested he start a band again, which led to Joe joining. Joe is a colleague of the mother, who is 38. They met through Ben's band, and eventually started talking more. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a close friend.\n\nSo the mother's actions led to her dating a colleague who is also a friend of her son. The key points here are the relationship dynamics. Is there a conflict of interest or ethical issues? Since they work in different departments, maybe not a direct work conflict, but the fact that Joe is a friend of her son complicates things. The son is 21, an adult, but the mother was his primary caregiver for a long time. Now that he's an adult, maybe he's more independent, but the relationship could still be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe mother might be overstepping by dating someone her son is close to. Even though the son is an adult, it could make him feel uncomfortable or like he lost control over his social circle. The mother might not realize how her actions affect Ben's feelings. Also, the mother hasn't dated in a long time, which could be a factor in her seeking companionship, but that doesn't excuse crossing into her son's friend group.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother is an adult with the right to date whoever she wants. The son is also an adult, so he should handle his own relationships. The mother's intention was to support Ben by getting him involved in the band, which led to Joe being in their lives. The problem arises when the mother starts a relationship with Joe, which Ben finds awkward.\n\nBut considering the power dynamic: the mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is his friend. The mother's relationship with Joe could create tension in Ben's social life and might affect his trust in his mother. It's also possible that the mother didn't consider how Ben would feel, which is important in maintaining good parent-child relations even when the child is an adult.\n\nSo, while the mother has the right to date, the situation is ethically murky because it involves her son's friend. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific circumstances, but generally, it's seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the mother might be in the wrong for not respecting her son's feelings about his friendships.\n"
