His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who had her son Ben at 17. Ben is now 21 and dealing with depression. She's helped him start a band, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined the band. Initially, Joe was just a work colleague, but they started talking more, and now they're texting a lot. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author is wondering if she's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference between the author (38) and Joe (29), the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the potential conflict of interest as a colleague. Also, Ben is 21, an adult, so the author is an adult as well. But Ben is her adult child, and she's his mother. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The author and Joe started interacting because of Ben's band. The author might feel lonely and hasn't dated in a long time. But Ben is upset because he sees Joe as a friend. However, since Ben is an adult, does he have the right to object? The author is also a colleague of Joe, which could complicate things at work, especially if there's a romantic relationship. \n\nIs there a conflict of interest? The author might be in a position of influence regarding the band or her job. Also, the age difference isn't too large, but the power dynamic could be an issue if the author has any authority over Joe at work. However, the story says they work in different departments and only know each other through colleagues. \n\nBut Ben is her son, and she's his parent. If Ben is upset, it's natural for the author to consider his feelings. However, Ben is an adult and can't control his mother's relationships. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to date someone just because her son is friends with them. But there might be other factors, like if the author is in a position to give Joe opportunities at work, which could lead to issues. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If there's no conflict of interest at work and Ben is an adult who can't dictate her mother's dating life, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if the author is in a position of authority over Joe, that could be problematic. The story doesn't mention any direct power dynamic, though. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because she's an adult with the right to date someone, and Ben is also an adult who needs to respect her choices despite his feelings. However, the potential work relationship could be a red flag if they start dating, but the story doesn't specify that the author has any power over Joe. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
