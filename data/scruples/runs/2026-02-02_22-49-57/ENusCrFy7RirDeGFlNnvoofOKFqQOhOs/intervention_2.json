His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was young, and he's been dealing with depression. She encourages him to start a band again. Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, ends up joining the band. They meet at work, he auditions, and becomes part of the band. Over time, the mother and Joe start chatting more, including a coffee meeting when Ben was late. They exchange numbers, text, and the mother starts feeling like she has a crush. Ben finds out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the mother is wrong for dating her son's friend, especially since Joe is part of Ben's band. Let's consider the dynamics. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is his friend. The mother is an adult, and Joe is an adult as well. They met through work, but connected over their son's band. There's no indication that the mother had prior inappropriate intentions. She was trying to help her son, which led to their interaction.\n\nPotential angles to consider: \n\n1. **Parent-Child Relationship**: The mother might be overstepping by dating someone who is a friend of her adult son. Even though Ben is 21, the mother's actions could make him feel uncomfortable or like her attention is shifting away from him. However, since Ben is an adult, he's capable of managing his own relationships and friendships. The mother isn't his parent in a legal sense anymore, so her dating someone else might be her own choice.\n\n2. **Workplace Context**: The mother and Joe work in different departments but met at work. The initial interaction was professional (posting a flyer for the band), and Joe auditioned for the band. There's no indication that the relationship started with any hidden agenda. However, workplace relationships can be tricky, but since they are not in the same department and Joe is part of the band (not her direct colleague), it's less of a conflict.\n\n3. **Ben's Feelings**: Ben is upset because it's weird. He compares it to dating his friend Matt. The mother argues it's different because Joe is a friend through the band, but Ben's perspective is valid. However, Ben is an adult, so this should be a matter of mutual respect between parent and child rather than a moral wrong.\n\n4. **Intentions and Actions**: The mother didn't set out to date Joe; it developed naturally from helping her son. The initial contact was to support Ben's interests. The coffee meeting was probably innocent, but as things progressed, the mother started developing feelings. There's no indication she manipulated the situation or acted with bad intentions.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Dating someone who is a close friend of a family member can be sensitive, but since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't violating any strict rules. The key here is consent and awareness from both parties. Since Joe is an adult and the mother is an adult, their relationship is legal and consensual. The issue is more about Ben's feelings and the potential for awkwardness in the family dynamic.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the mother should be more cautious to avoid embarrassing or upsetting her son. Others might argue that she's within her rights to date someone if she's interested, especially if the son is an adult. It's a balance between respecting her autonomy and considering her son's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ben's feelings are understandable, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. She acted to support her son, and the relationship with Joe developed naturally. The key points are mutual consent, the adults involved, and the lack of intent to harm. Therefore, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
