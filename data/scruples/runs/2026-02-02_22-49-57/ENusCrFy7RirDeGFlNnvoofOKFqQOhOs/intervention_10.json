His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. \n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom who had her son at 17. Now he's 21, and she's 38. He's been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, leading him to make a flyer. She put the flyer up at her workplace where she met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe joined the band. They interacted mostly because of the band, and then started talking more, leading to a relationship. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a close friend of his.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider factors like relationships with son's friends, boundaries, the son's feelings, and potential conflicts. \n\nThe key points are:\n- The mother's intention was to help her son by connecting with his friend, which initially worked well for the son's mental health.\n- The relationship between the mother and Joe started as a work-related interaction through the band, not a personal one. They became friends and then dated.\n- The son is an adult (21), so he might be expected to handle such situations, but he's still adjusting to his mother's new social circle. His reaction could be due to feeling uncomfortable about a parent dating someone close to his age or friend group.\n- The age difference between the mother (38) and Joe (29) is 9 years, which is significant but not uncommon. However, Joe is the same age as the son's friends, which might make the son feel like his mother is encroaching on his peer group.\n- The mother's explanation is that Joe is part of the band, so there's a legitimate reason for their initial interaction. The transition to a romantic relationship could be seen as a natural progression from friendship, but it might disrupt the son's social dynamics.\n\nPotential issues:\n- The son might feel that his mother is overstepping by getting involved with his friend. Even though he's an adult, it's a sensitive situation because of their history and his mental health.\n- There's a possible conflict of interest if Joe is working with Ben in the band. The mother's role as a mediator or supporter could be compromised if there's a romantic relationship.\n- The mother might be prioritizing her own happiness, which is valid, but it could inadvertently affect her son's well-being, especially if he's still vulnerable.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother hasn't done anything illegal or unethical. She's an adult and free to date. The son is also an adult and should have some autonomy. However, the dynamic between a parent and a friend of their adult child is complex and can lead to tension regardless of intentions.\n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that parents are in the wrong if it disrupts the child's life or if the child feels violated. In this case, the son is upset and drew a comparison to dating a close friend (Matt), which the mother might not consider the same since Joe isn't as close as Matt. But the son's perspective matters here. \n\nThe mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult with her own needs and happiness. However, she might need to consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. The son's reaction could be valid, but the mother's actions aren't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might hinge on whether the mother's actions are considered intrusive or if the son's reaction is an overreaction. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and considering the mother's good intentions and the son's age, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a valid case for both sides. The key is that both parties have valid perspectives, but the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship.\n"
