His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the mother) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, and her son Ben is 21. She's been a single parent since he was 17, so she's been raising him mostly alone. Ben has struggled with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, which led him to meet Joe, a 29-year-old coworker. Joe joined the band as a friend. Then, the mother and Joe started talking more, bonding over work and the band. Eventually, they began texting and the mother feels like she has a crush. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mother didn't have a relationship with Joe before Ben met him. She connected with him through the band, which was meant to help her son. She and Joe became friends through work, then through Ben's band. The mother is a single parent who hasn't dated in a while, and she's trying to build a social life. Ben is upset because he's close to Joe, but the mother argues it's different from dating a lifelong friend like Matt. \n\nIs there any ethical issue here? Well, the mother is not Ben's parent in the sense of a guardian anymore since Ben is an adult (21). However, the dynamic might still be complicated because Ben was raised by her. If the mother and Joe are both adults, and the son is an adult as well, technically, there's no legal issue. But socially, it's about how it affects the relationships. The son feels hurt and thinks it's weird. The mother might be overstepping if she's in a relationship with someone her adult son is close to, even if the son is an adult. But the mother is also an adult with the right to her own relationships. \n\nThe situation could be problematic if the mother is still making decisions that affect Ben's social circle. Also, if Joe is working with the mother, there's a potential for workplace issues if they start dating. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's intention was to help her son, and then she formed a friendship with Joe. The fact that Ben is upset is a factor, but she's not necessarily in the wrong if she's an adult choosing her own partner. The complexity is in the relationship with her son and the potential for conflict. But since Ben is an adult, her choice might be her own. However, if the mother is still the primary influence in Ben's life, it could create tension. \n\nAnother angle: the mother introduced Joe to Ben through the band. Then, she formed a relationship with Joe. It could be seen as using Ben's social circle to find her own partner, which might not be the healthiest approach. But again, if the mother is single and looking for a relationship, that's her right. The key is whether she's respecting Ben's autonomy and his feelings. If Ben is upset, maybe she should consider his perspective, but it's not necessarily her fault. It's a sensitive situation, but the mother isn't in the wrong morally, though she might need to handle it carefully to maintain good relations with her son.\n"
