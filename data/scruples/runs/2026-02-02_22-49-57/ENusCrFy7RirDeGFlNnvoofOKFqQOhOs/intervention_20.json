His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a mom who's a single parent to her 21-year-old son, Ben, starts dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and a colleague. The key points here are the relationships involved.\n\nFirst, Ben is an adult now. He's 21, so he's of legal age. The mother had a tough time raising him alone, and now Ben is trying to get back into a band, which Joe joins. The mother and Joe start talking, and eventually they start dating. Ben gets upset about it, comparing it to dating his friend from middle school, Matt.\n\nI need to consider if the mother did anything wrong. The main issue here is the relationship between the mother and Joe, who is Ben's friend. But Ben is an adult, so his consent is important. However, the mother might have a responsibility to consider Ben's feelings, especially since she's been the primary caregiver. But since Ben is an adult, he can't legally stop her from dating. \n\nIs there any power dynamic or conflict of interest? Joe is also a colleague, which might complicate things in the workplace, but the mother isn't in a position of authority over him. The story doesn't mention any coercion or manipulation. The mother initiated the connection by giving Joe Ben's number, but Joe was already involved with the band, so the relationship between the mother and Joe developed after that.\n\nBen is upset because he feels it's weird. But since he's an adult, his feelings are valid, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. The key is whether the mother acted in a way that was respectful to Ben's feelings. However, Ben is an adult, and the mother might have the right to date whoever she chooses, even if it upsets her son. The situation is different from dating someone who is Ben's close friend, but since Ben is grown, the mother isn't in the wrong here. Also, the mother mentioned she hasn't dated since Ben's father, so this might be a new step for her. \n\nI think the answer is B, the mother isn't in the wrong. She's an adult with her own life, and Ben is an adult who can handle his own friendships. The mother didn't intentionally try to hurt Ben; she formed a relationship with someone who was a friend of her son, but that's not inherently wrong. The main conflict is Ben's discomfort, but that doesn't make the mother at fault.\n"
