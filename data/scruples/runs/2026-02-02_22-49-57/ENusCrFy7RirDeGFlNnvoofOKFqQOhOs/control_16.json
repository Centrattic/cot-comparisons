His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe woman, let's call her Mom, had her son Ben when she was 17. Now Ben is 21 and she's 38. Her son has been dealing with depression and she's been helping him get back into a band. She put up a flyer for the band at her workplace, where she met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe joined the band. Over time, Mom and Joe started talking more, and eventually, they started texting a lot. Ben found out and is upset about it, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. Mom is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Mom is Ben's parent, and Joe is his friend. The age difference between Mom and Ben is 17 years, which is significant. Then there's the age gap between Mom and Joe (she's 38, he's 29), which is 9 years. That's less, but still a consideration. \n\nNow, the key points are: Mom wasn't dating anyone since Ben's father left, and she's been focused on raising Ben. She met Joe through Ben's band and started talking about work and music. Then they started texting a lot, and Ben is upset. The question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, there's a potential for a conflict of interest here because Joe is Ben's friend. If Mom starts dating Joe, Ben might feel like his friend is being taken from him, especially since he's been struggling with loneliness and depression. The mother's actions could affect Ben's emotional state. Also, since Joe and Ben are both 21 and in the same age group, the mother dating someone closer in age to her son might make Ben feel like his mother is encroaching on his social circle or not respecting boundaries.\n\nHowever, the mother's perspective is that she's trying to support her son by helping him form connections, and she's just developing a friendship with Joe. She didn't intend to date him initially. The fact that Joe is a colleague adds another layer, but since they work in different departments, maybe it's not a conflict in the workplace. However, if they start dating, there could be workplace issues, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong in her relationship with her son.\n\nAnother angle is Ben's reaction. He's 21, an adult, and he's upset about his mother dating his friend. It's possible that he's overreacting because of his own insecurities or past experiences with depression and loneliness. But as his mother, Mom needs to consider his feelings. Even though he's an adult, the mother-son relationship is still significant. If dating Joe makes Ben feel uncomfortable or isolated, then Mom might be in the wrong if she proceeds without considering his feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother is also an adult with her own needs for companionship. She hasn't dated since Ben's father left, and forming a relationship could be healthy for her. The question is whether her actions are wrong, not whether she should date someone. The issue is the conflict between her needs and her son's feelings.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally considered inappropriate to date someone who is close to your child, as it can complicate the child's emotional well-being. There's also the aspect of power dynamics if Joe is still in the band with Ben, though he's an adult as well. But since both Joe and Ben are adults, the main conflict is between the mother and son.\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? It depends. If she's aware of Ben's feelings and proceeds regardless, that could be seen as wrong. However, if she's trying to maintain her own happiness and hasn't forced anything on Ben, it's a bit more nuanced. However, the fact that Ben found out and is upset might mean that she didn't consider the impact on him, making her at least partially responsible.\n\nAnother point is that the mother initiated contact with Joe through Ben's project, which might have set the stage for this situation. She gave Joe Ben's number, leading to their friendship. So, she brought Joe into her son's life more closely, which might have made the situation more personal.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother has a right to her own life and relationships, the situation is complicated by the existing relationship with her son. Since Ben is still her adult child and he's expressed feelings of discomfort, the mother should take his feelings into account. Therefore, she might be in the wrong if she continues the relationship without addressing Ben's concerns.\n"
