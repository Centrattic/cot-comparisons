His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom, dealing with Ben's depression. She helped him start a band, and Joe, a colleague, joined the band. They started talking more, then texting, and now Ben is upset because he found out they're dating.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference\u2014Ben is 21, the mother is 38. That's a 17-year gap, which isn't huge, but it's significant enough that the son might feel protective or uncomfortable. The mother hasn't dated in years, so this is new ground for her. The son is still in his early adulthood, dealing with depression, and might be sensitive about his mother's relationships. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue because both Joe and the mother are adults. But emotionally, it's a family dynamic. The son Ben is upset because he compares it to dating his friend Matt. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping if there's a lack of boundaries. However, she wasn't the one who initiated the relationship; she was just connecting because of the band and then they developed a relationship naturally. \n\nThe mother's intentions seem to be in good faith. She wanted to help her son by getting him involved in the band, which worked out. The relationship with Joe started as a professional interaction but evolved into something personal. The son's reaction might stem from feeling that his social circle (his friend group) is being invaded by his mother's new partner. \n\nBut Ben is an adult now. He's 21, so he's capable of forming his own opinions and relationships. However, given that he's been dealing with depression and might still be looking to his mother for emotional support, this new development could complicate things. The mother might be in a position where she needs to consider how her actions affect Ben's mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother has a right to her own life and relationships. She hasn't done anything illegal or unethical, just started a relationship with an adult who's part of her son's life. The question is whether she overstepped by dating someone from her son's friend group. It's a sensitive situation, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong. It's more about how to navigate the family dynamics and Ben's feelings.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the mother's actions are harmful. If Ben is upset and the mother is aware, she might need to address his concerns, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. So, I think the mother isn't in the wrong, but she might need to handle the situation with care to support her son.\n"
