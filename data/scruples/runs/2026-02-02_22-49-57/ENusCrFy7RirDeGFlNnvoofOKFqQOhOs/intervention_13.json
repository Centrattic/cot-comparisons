His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a mom who started dating her son's friend. The son is 21, and the mom is 38. The friend, Joe, is 29. They met through the son's band, and the mom started talking to Joe, leading to a relationship. The son isn't happy about it and feels it's weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is a single parent who's been raising her son alone. He's an adult now, 21, which is a young adult. The mom hasn't dated since the son's father left, which might mean she's been focused on her son for a long time. Now, she's forming a relationship with someone her son is friends with. The son is upset because he feels it's similar to dating someone he's close to, like his friend Matt. But the mom argues it's different. \n\nI should think about consent and age. Both the mom and Joe are adults. The mom is 38, Joe is 29. So they're both adults, capable of making their own decisions. The son is also an adult, so he's old enough to have his own opinions, but is it his place to dictate his mom's relationships? \n\nThe son's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable. He might feel that Joe is part of his social circle, and his mom dating him changes the dynamic. It's possible he feels insecure or that the relationship could affect his friendship with Joe. But since the son is an adult, he should have some autonomy in his feelings, but does that mean the mom is wrong? \n\nAnother angle is the initial introduction. The mom connected Joe with her son for the band, which helped her son make friends. That was a positive step. Now, the mom and Joe's relationship might make the son feel like the lines have been crossed. However, the mom isn't the one who initiated the relationship with Joe; they started talking naturally. \n\nAlso, considering the mom's social circle, she might be lonely and found a connection with Joe. It's important for adults to have their own relationships outside of family. The mom's actions don't seem manipulative or underhanded. She didn't know Joe well initially, and the relationship developed after mutual interactions. \n\nThe son's comparison to dating his friend Matt is a bit different because Matt is his peer, while Joe is an adult friend. But the son is an adult too, so he should understand that his mom can form relationships with adults outside of his immediate social group. However, the proximity of Joe being part of his son's life might cause tension. \n\nIs the mom overstepping? Since she's a parent and Joe is part of her son's life, there could be a power dynamic if Joe feels pressure because of the mother-son relationship. But there's no indication here that the mom is pressuring Joe. They both seem to be adults entering the relationship consensually. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the mom isn't in the wrong because she's an adult forming a relationship with another adult. Her son's feelings are valid, but he can't dictate her personal choices. The answer should be B (No).\n"
