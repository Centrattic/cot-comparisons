His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who has raised her son Ben from a young age. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, she posted it at work, met Joe, who ended up joining the band. They became friends, and now there's a romantic relationship forming between the author and Joe. Ben is upset about it, comparing it to dating a close friend of his, like his friend Matt from middle school.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference and the existing relationship dynamics. The author is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap, which isn't too bad. But the main issue is the son's friend. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, Ben's feelings. He's 21, an adult, but he's been close with Joe since he joined the band. The author's relationship with Joe started from work, then through Ben's band. Now that they're dating, Ben is upset. But is Ben's reaction valid? Since he's an adult, he might feel it's intrusive or a conflict of interest. However, the author isn't dating Matt, who is his friend since middle school. The question is whether this is a similar situation. The user thinks it's different because Joe is Ben's friend in the band, but the user is comparing to a long-standing friendship like with Matt.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author is a colleague of Joe's, so there's a work relationship. Dating a colleague can be problematic in a workplace, but since the band is separate, maybe that's not the main issue. However, Ben is her child, so there's a parent-child dynamic. The user is the mother, so dating someone who is a friend of her adult son could be seen as overstepping, but Ben is also an adult and might have his own boundaries.\n\nEthically, the mother isn't in the wrong for wanting to date someone, but there's the potential for conflict with her son. The son being 21 is an adult and can have his own opinions, but the mother needs to consider how her actions affect him. However, it's not like she's dating the son's friend in a way that's interfering with his life directly. The band is a shared interest, and Joe is part of it. The user might be in the right because she's an adult, and Ben is also an adult who can handle his own feelings. But Ben might feel it's awkward or intrusive.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's an adult with the right to date, and while Ben's feelings are valid, she isn't obligated to avoid dating someone just because he's friends with her son. It's more about communication and respecting each other's boundaries. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, which doesn't seem to be the case here, she isn't in the wrong. The workplace aspect could be a red flag, but since the relationship is separate from work, maybe not. The main issue is Ben's reaction, but that's more about how he feels rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong.\n"
