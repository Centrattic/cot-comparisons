His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother is alone raising her son Ben since he was 17. Ben is 21 now and has been dealing with depression. The mother suggested he start a band again, so he made a flyer. She posted it at her workplace and met Joe, a colleague, who ended up joining the band. Initially, the mother thought it was just for Ben's benefit, but then she started talking to Joe more, leading to a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt since middle school.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mother's intentions were to help her son, not to date Joe. The connection between her and Joe started after the band, during a coffee meeting where they just talked about work and the band. The son's reaction is based on the idea that it's \"weird\" and a comparison to his own friend. \n\nI need to consider if the mother did anything that's objectively wrong. There's no mention of her being manipulative or using her position to get Joe involved. She facilitated the band for Ben's happiness, and the relationship with Joe seems to have evolved naturally. The son's upset is about the social awkwardness rather than any actual wrongdoing by the mother. Also, the mother hasn't been in a relationship since Ben's father, so it's possible she's just reconnecting. \n\nThe comparison to dating a friend's friend (like Matt) is a common concern, but the mother's role was initially to support Ben. The main issue is the son's discomfort, but the mother isn't violating any laws or ethical boundaries here. Unless there's a policy against dating a colleague, but the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nI think the mother isn't in the wrong. She's an adult with the right to date, and her son's feelings are valid but not a reason for her to be in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
