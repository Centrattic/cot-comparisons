His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The story goes that the mother, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben had been struggling with depression and the mother helped him start a band. She posted a flyer at work, met Joe, who ended up joining the band. Then, after some interactions, the mother started dating Joe, which made Ben upset. The user thinks the mother isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is in a new relationship with someone her son is friends with. The son is an adult, 21, same age as Joe. The mother is Ben's parent, but he's 21, so technically an adult. However, there's a history of Ben's father not being around, and the mother being a single parent. Ben was dealing with depression, and the mother tried to help him by connecting with Joe through the band. That's a good intention.\n\nNow, when the mother starts dating Joe, Ben is upset. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong. The key points here would be consent and boundaries. Since Ben is an adult, does he have a right to object? Well, as an adult, he's independent, but there's a parent-child relationship that might have lingering effects. The mother might be overstepping if she's dating someone her adult son is friends with, but sometimes adult children can form strong bonds with friends and feel protective.\n\nBut the mother's actions were initially to help Ben. She didn't date Joe immediately; the relationship started after work interactions and mutual interest. The fact that Ben found out and was upset is a point. However, Ben is an adult and can't control his mother's dating life. The mother is in a new relationship, which is a personal choice. The issue here is whether there's a conflict of interest or if the mother's actions could affect Ben negatively. Since Ben is already 21 and presumably handling his own life, the mother's relationship with Joe is her choice. The mother might be acting on her own desires, which is valid for an adult. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of being a parent. Sometimes, even if the child is an adult, the parent might need to consider the child's feelings, especially if there's a history of the child being sensitive. But Ben is an adult and can express his feelings, but that doesn't mean he can dictate his mother's choices. The mother's actions are her own, and unless there's some conflict of interest at work (which isn't mentioned here), it's her personal life.\n\nSo, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's an adult, and dating someone her son is friends with isn't inherently wrong, especially since they're both adults. The son is upset, but that doesn't make the mother wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
