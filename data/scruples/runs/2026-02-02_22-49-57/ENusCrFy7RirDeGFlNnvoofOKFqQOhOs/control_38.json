His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a single mom, who's been the sole parent to her son Ben since he was 17, starts dating her son's friend Joe. Ben is now 21, and he's upset about this. The mom met Joe through Ben's band, which she helped start by posting flyers. Joe became part of the band, and they started talking more, eventually leading to a relationship. Ben is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is 38, and Joe is 29. Ben is 21, so she's dating someone who is about 10 years younger than her and her son is the same age as Joe. The age difference between the mom and Joe isn't that extreme, maybe not a huge issue. But the main conflict is between the mom and her son. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong for the mom to date her son's friend. From a legal standpoint, consensual adult relationships aren't illegal. But socially, there's a stigma around parental relationships with people close to their children. The son is an adult, though. At 21, he's legally an adult and might expect some independence, but he's still in a situation where his mom is his primary caregiver. This could complicate their relationship. \n\nThe mom's intentions are to find happiness after being single for a while. She didn't start the relationship with the band, which she helped create. The connection happened organically through a mutual interest in the band. However, the son feels it's weird because it's his friend, which creates tension. \n\nAnother angle is if the mom and Joe have a power dynamic. Since the mom works with Joe, even though they're in different departments, there could be issues of professional boundaries. But the story mentions they didn't interact much before. Also, she's the one who connected Joe to Ben's band, so maybe she had some influence there. But the relationship between them started after work hours and wasn't necessarily in a professional context. \n\nThe son's reaction is about feeling that it's inappropriate. But considering he's an adult, his feelings are valid, but does that make his mom wrong? The mom didn't force the relationship; it developed naturally. She's also looking for companionship, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for conflict in the household. If the son is already dealing with depression, this situation might add stress. But the mom's actions were meant to help Ben by getting him involved in the band. The fact that she and Joe bonded over work stress and music might not be malicious. \n\nThe key points here are the son's right to his feelings versus the mother's right to pursue a relationship. Since both are adults, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. But some might argue that it's a sensitive situation, especially with the son's mental health. However, the story doesn't indicate that the mother is being manipulative or that the relationship is harmful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's about adult relationships and personal choice, even though it's a delicate situation. The son's upset is valid, but it doesn't make the mother wrong. However, if there's a professional boundary issue, but the story doesn't show that she's in a position of authority over Joe. So probably B.\n"
