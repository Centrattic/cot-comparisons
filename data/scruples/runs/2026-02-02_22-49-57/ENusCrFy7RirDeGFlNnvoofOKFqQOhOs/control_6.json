His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a mother dating her son's friend. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's a single mom who's been raising him alone. Ben has depression and is introverted, so she's been trying to help him make friends. She connected him with Joe, a colleague, to start a band. Initially, Joe was just part of the band, but they started talking more, especially after the coffee meeting. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a long-time friend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The mother and Joe are both adults. The mother's son is 21, so he's an adult too. Legally, there's no issue here. The main concerns are about the mother-son relationship and the son's feelings. The mother might be overstepping if she's taking on a role that the son perceives as too close or interfering with his social circle. However, the mother's intention was to help Ben make friends, and the relationship with Joe developed naturally after that. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult, and her relationship with Joe is separate from her role as Ben's parent. However, the fact that she's dating a friend of her son could create tension. The son's reaction is valid because it's a sensitive situation where it might feel like the parent is invading the son's social space. But since all parties are adults, the mother isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether her actions are respectful and not manipulative. \n\nThe answer might hinge on the mother's awareness and the son's feelings. If she respected Ben's boundaries and didn't push the relationship, she's not in the wrong. But if she encouraged the relationship knowing it could hurt Ben, she might be. However, the scenario doesn't indicate she did that. She connected Joe with Ben first, and the relationship with Joe developed independently. The son's reaction is more about his discomfort than the mother's manipulation. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The mother isn't intentionally wrong, but she should consider her son's feelings. However, since she's not a parent to Joe and the relationship is consensual, she isn't in the wrong per se. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because she's an adult with her own life, and the son's discomfort is valid but not a clear case of her wrongdoing.\n"
