His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author dating their son's friend, Joe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a 38-year-old single mother who has been raising her son Ben since he was a child. Ben is 21, and they've been through a lot together, including his struggles with depression and therapy. The author suggested Ben start a band again, which led to Joe, a coworker, joining. The author and Joe started talking, and eventually, they began dating, which upset Ben.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze the dynamics. The author's intention was to help her son by suggesting the band, which worked out. However, when she started a relationship with Joe, Ben felt uncomfortable. The key issue here is the mother-son dynamic and the potential for Ben to feel his mother is taking a friend from him. \n\nThe author's actions aren't malicious. She connected with Joe through her son's interests, and their relationship started professionally. The transition from colleague to friend to potential romantic partner is a gray area. However, the author's relationship with Ben is close, given her history as a single parent. Ben's reaction is valid because it's unusual and could create tension. But the author isn't necessarily at fault here. She didn't intentionally set out to date Ben's friend; the relationship developed naturally. \n\nConsiderations include the age difference: the author is 38, and Joe is 29. They're both adults, so the relationship isn't about exploitation. Also, the author didn't hide the relationship initially; Ben found out through her texting Joe. However, the author might need to be more mindful of Ben's feelings. The situation is complex, but it's not entirely the author's fault. She's an adult pursuing a relationship, and while it might be awkward for Ben, he needs to adjust to the idea. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
