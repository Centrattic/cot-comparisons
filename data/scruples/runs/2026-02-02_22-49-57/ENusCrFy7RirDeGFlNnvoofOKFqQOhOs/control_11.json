His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is a single mother, getting involved with her son's friend, who is also a colleague. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She helped him start a band, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined. They had some interactions where the mother felt drawn to Joe, leading to Ben being upset. The main issue is whether the mother is wrong for dating her son's friend, especially considering the age difference and the fact that Joe is a colleague.\n\nI should consider the mother's intentions. She was trying to help her son, which is a caring act. However, the relationship between her and Joe started after work interactions. The fact that she gave him Ben's number initially might not be an issue, but the subsequent texting and Ben's reaction are key. \n\nAge-wise, the mother is 38 and Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap, which isn't huge, but when considering power dynamics, especially if Joe is a subordinate or in the same workplace, that could complicate things. However, the user says they work in different departments and only knew each other through colleagues, so maybe the power dynamic isn't too intense, but it's still a workplace relationship which can have its own issues.\n\nBen is 21, so he's an adult. His feeling that it's weird is valid, but as an adult, he should handle his own feelings. However, the mother is his guardian, so there's a potential conflict of interest. The mother might be overstepping by getting involved with her adult child's friend, especially if it affects their relationship.\n\nThe mother hasn't dated in a while, so it's understandable she might feel a connection. But the situation is complicated by Ben's history with depression. If Ben is already dealing with loneliness and mental health issues, this could impact him negatively. The mother needs to consider how her actions affect her son's emotional state.\n\nAlso, the fact that Joe is a colleague adds another layer. Workplace relationships can lead to complications, especially if it affects work environments or if there's a perception of impropriety. The mother giving out her son's number and then forming a relationship with Joe might not be unethical, but it's a sensitive area.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices, but she needs to be mindful of her son's feelings and the workplace dynamics. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since Ben is an adult, it's his responsibility to manage his feelings as well, but the mother's actions could be seen as invasive or inconsiderate. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal boundaries. But legally and ethically, unless there's a direct harm to Ben's well-being (which isn't clear here), the mother isn't in the wrong. However, if Ben's mental health was affected, that's a different story. But the user states Ben is getting better, and this situation is causing current upset. Still, the mother's actions might not be wrong per se, but she should be more considerate. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the mother's actions aren't inherently wrong, but they are complicated. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but she should be aware of the potential impacts on her son and workplace.\n"
