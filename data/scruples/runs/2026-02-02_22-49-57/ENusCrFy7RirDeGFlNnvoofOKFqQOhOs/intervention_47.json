His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mother of Ben, a 21-year-old, started dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and a colleague of hers. So first, I need to consider the dynamics here.\n\nThe mother is single, hasn't dated since Ben's father left. She met Joe through Ben's band. Joe became part of the band, and then she started talking to him more. They ended up texting a lot, and Ben found out, which made him upset. The key points here are the mother's role as a parent and the relationship with her son's friend. \n\nI need to think about whether there's a conflict of interest. She's Ben's mother, and Joe is his friend. If Ben is 21, he's an adult, so maybe the mother isn't in the wrong because he's an adult and can make his own decisions. But there might be a parent figure aspect. Also, the mother and Joe are colleagues, so there could be workplace issues if they date. But the question is about whether the mother is in the wrong in the relationship with her son's friend, not the workplace aspect. \n\nBen is upset because it's similar to dating his friend Matt. The mother argues it's different. But why is it different? Well, Matt is a friend from middle school, same age as Ben. Joe is part of Ben's band, and they've been working together. Maybe there's a closer connection through the band and the fact that Joe is involved in Ben's life more directly. \n\nHowever, since Ben is an adult, the mother's decision to date someone he knows might not be her fault. She wasn't actively trying to date him; it developed naturally from the band and work. The mother might not see the issue since Ben is grown. But Ben is upset, so there's a family dynamic. The mother's actions could be affecting Ben's comfort and trust. \n\nBut the question is if the mother is in the wrong. Legally, she's not doing anything illegal. Ethically, it's more complex. As a parent, she might have a responsibility to consider her son's feelings. But Ben is an adult, so maybe she's not obligated to avoid dating his friends. However, the act of dating a close friend might be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nAnother angle: Did she act in a way that was manipulative or took advantage of her role as a parent? The text suggests she introduced Joe to Ben's band, but Joe was interested in the band first. Their relationship formed after Joe was part of the band. The mother's initial introduction was to help Ben. \n\nSo, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult, and it's her choice to date someone. However, she should consider her son's feelings. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. But according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI think the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult, and Ben is also an adult. The mother's actions might be inconsiderate, but not necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
