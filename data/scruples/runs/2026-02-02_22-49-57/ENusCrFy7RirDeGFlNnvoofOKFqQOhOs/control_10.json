His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother had her son at 17, the father wasn't around, so she's been a single mom. The son, Ben, is 21 now and has been dealing with depression. The mother suggested he start a band again, which led to meeting Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. They initially connected through the band, and then the mother started texting Joe after they met for coffee. Now Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird and compares it to dating a friend from middle school (Matt), but the mother feels it's different.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the mother is at fault here. Let's break down the factors. The mother and Joe are colleagues, which might be a conflict of interest if they start dating. But the key issue seems to be Ben's reaction. Ben is an adult now, 21, so he's of age. The mother is also an adult, 38. The relationship between parent and child can be complex, especially when the parent is a single parent for most of the child's life. The mother might feel lonely and hasn't dated in years. \n\nHowever, Ben might feel that his mother is overstepping by dating a friend he's close to, even though Joe is also a colleague of hers. The mother gave Joe her son's number, but then she ended up talking to Joe more. The dynamic here is that the mother is in a position of authority regarding her son's life, even though Ben is an adult. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing boundaries, especially since she's the one who introduced Joe to Ben's band. \n\nAlso, the fact that Ben was upset and felt it was weird might indicate that the mother didn't consider his feelings enough. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might have a responsibility to be sensitive to his emotional state, especially since he's been dealing with depression. Dating a friend of his could potentially cause him stress or make him feel uncomfortable, even if the mother didn't intend it. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to pursue a relationship. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and the son's maturity. Since Ben is 21 and in a situation where he's handling his own life to some extent, he might not expect his mother to date his close friend, which could feel like a betrayal. The mother might not be in the wrong because she's not responsible for her son's adult relationships, but the situation could be awkward and cause tension. \n\nBut there's also the professional aspect with Joe being her colleague. If they start dating, that could create workplace issues. The mother gave her workplace number to Joe, which is a bit of a boundary issue. However, since the band is part of Ben's college life and not the mother's workplace, maybe that's not the main point. \n\nThe core issue is the relationship between the mother and her adult son's friend. The mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult and can date, but she should have considered Ben's feelings and perhaps discussed it with him first. However, the story doesn't mention that the mother was intentionally trying to date Joe. She gave him the number for the band, they started talking, and the relationship developed. It's possible that the mother didn't intend to date him but ended up doing so. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Legally, there's nothing wrong with an adult mother dating someone. But emotionally, it could affect Ben. The mother might need to be transparent with Ben and address his concerns. Whether she's in the wrong might depend on how it affects Ben and if she's being respectful of his feelings. Since the mother didn't consider Ben's perspective before proceeding, she might be at fault for not discussing the potential relationship with him, even though she has the right to date. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the mother is in the wrong) because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship, even though she's an adult and can date. The comparison to dating Matt, a friend since middle school, might not be the same because Joe is a recent addition through the band and also a colleague. But the key is the mother's responsibility and the boundaries in their relationship.\n"
