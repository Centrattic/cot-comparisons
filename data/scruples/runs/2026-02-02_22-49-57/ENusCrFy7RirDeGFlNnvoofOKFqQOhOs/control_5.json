His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's a single mom, he's been dealing with depression. She helped him start a band, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined. They initially met through the band flyer. They became friends, and then started talking more, leading to a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his lifelong friend.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the mother dating her son's friend. There's a potential conflict here. The mother's intentions were to help her son, and Joe was a colleague. But when things shifted from professional to personal, that's where the problem arises.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the mother and Joe started as colleagues. The mother was in a position of influence by connecting Joe with her son's band. That could be seen as a conflict of interest, especially if Joe's participation in the band was influenced by their personal connection. Also, the mother's role as a parent and the son's feelings need to be considered. Ben is 21, an adult, but he's been struggling with depression and might feel protective of his friend. However, the mother is an adult too, and has the right to date. \n\nBut there's a risk of favoritism or abuse of position. If Joe was in the band because of the mother's influence at work, that could be problematic. Also, the son's emotional state might make him more sensitive. The mother might have crossed a boundary by moving from a professional relationship to a romantic one with someone connected to her son. However, the mother wasn't in a position of authority over Joe in a personal sense, just a colleague. \n\nAnother angle is the son's age. At 21, he's an adult, so the mother isn't in a traditional parent-child dynamic anymore. But the mother's actions might have undermined her son's autonomy or made him feel like his social circle is being invaded. The comparison to a lifelong friend is a valid point, but in that case, the mother wouldn't have the same influence. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's personal life. She hasn't dated in a while, and she found someone. But the way she connected with Joe through her son's band could be a conflict of interest. She might have used her position at work to promote the band, which led to meeting Joe. That could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the mother's role as both a parent and a colleague might have created a situation where boundaries were crossed. The key points are: using work to connect with Joe, which could affect workplace dynamics, and the son's emotional reaction. The mother's actions might be seen as using her son's band to meet someone, which could be a conflict of interest. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother's actions created a conflict of interest at work and how it affects her son. Since she's a colleague, and she used work to connect with Joe, that's a problem. Also, Ben's feelings are valid because he's the one who introduced Joe to the band, so the relationship could make him feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the mother might be in the wrong because of the conflict of interest and not considering her son's feelings.\n"
