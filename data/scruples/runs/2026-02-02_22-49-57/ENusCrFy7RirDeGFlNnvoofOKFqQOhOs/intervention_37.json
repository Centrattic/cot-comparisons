His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is that the mother, who's been a single parent since she was 17, is now 38 and her son Ben is 21. Ben has depression and was in a band that disbanded. She suggested he start a new band, put up a flyer at her workplace, which led to her colleague Joe joining the band. They started talking more, and eventually, they began dating. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and Joe were colleagues, but they had minimal interaction before. The initial contact was work-related, helping Ben's band. Then, through coffee and texting, they developed a relationship. The son is 21, an adult, so his feelings matter, but he's still her child. The mother hasn't dated in a while, which adds context to her emotional state.\n\nIs there a conflict of interest? She gave Joe Ben's number, but Joe approached Ben for the band. The mother's relationship with Joe started after the band was formed. However, the fact that she's the mother of one band member and is dating another could be seen as crossing boundaries. But Ben is an adult, so maybe he can handle his own relationships. The mother might feel she's just forming a new relationship without intent to interfere. However, the son's discomfort is valid because it's his friend. The mother might be in a position of influence regarding the band if Ben feels she's favoring Joe. Also, the mother's actions could affect Ben's mental health if he feels her attention is divided or if he's uncomfortable.\n\nBut on the other hand, the mother is also an adult with her own life. She's been a single parent for a long time, and finding someone might be important for her happiness. The key is whether she's acting in good faith and not exploiting any position of authority. Since Joe is a colleague but in a different department, maybe the professional boundaries aren't as strict as if she were in a management role. However, the fact that she's involved in the band as a facilitator (posting flyers, connecting them) might complicate things. The main issue is Ben's reaction. He's 21, so he can have his own opinion, but he's still her son, and she needs to respect his feelings. The mother might need to consider if her relationship with Joe affects Ben's ability to interact with Joe without discomfort. If Joe is Ben's friend, Ben's perception is important. However, the mother isn't necessarily wrong if she's not forcing anything and Joe isn't pressuring her. The answer might hinge on whether the mother is respecting both her adult son's feelings and her own needs. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The mother's intentions seem genuine, but the relationship could create tension. So, maybe she's not in the wrong, but she should handle the situation with sensitivity.\n"
