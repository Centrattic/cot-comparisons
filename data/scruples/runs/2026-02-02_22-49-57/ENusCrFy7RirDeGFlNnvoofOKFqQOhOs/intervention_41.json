His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The author is 38, a single mom since she was 17, and her son Ben is 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted, so she wanted him to start a band again. She put up a flyer for him at work, which Joe saw. Joe ended up joining the band, and after some interactions, they started texting and the author is now dating him. Ben is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author introduced Joe to her son's band as a way to help Ben. That was probably a good intention. Then, she and Joe started talking, leading to a relationship. The key points here are the relationship between the author and Joe, and how it affects Ben.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Ben is an adult now, 21 years old. He's been taking care of himself for a while, but maybe the mother still has a strong attachment. The author's actions might make Ben feel uncomfortable, especially since Joe is his friend. But Ben is an adult, so he can manage his own feelings. However, the mother's relationship with Joe could affect their relationship. But the author is also an adult and has the right to date someone. The question is about whether she's in the wrong ethically.\n\nThe story mentions that Ben got upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. But the author argues it's different. The mother's actions were initially to help her son, but then she pursued a relationship with Joe. Is there a boundary issue here? Maybe. The mother was the one who connected Joe with the band, which might have created a situation where she's dating someone her son is close to. However, since Ben is an adult, it's his choice how he feels about it, but the mother's actions could be seen as intrusive if she's dating someone her son considers a friend.\n\nBut also, the author and Joe were colleagues, and their relationship started after the band was formed. The mother didn't know Joe outside of work, and their relationship started after mutual interactions. It's possible that the author didn't realize the son's feelings about Joe being a friend. However, since Ben is an adult, he should communicate his feelings to his mother. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship, as she's an adult and has the right to date. But maybe she should have considered Ben's feelings more if she noticed any potential discomfort.\n\nBut the story doesn't say the author was intentionally trying to take Joe from Ben. She was helping her son first. The problem is that Ben feels it's weird, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. It's a sensitive situation, but she's an adult with her own right to date. Ben needs to handle his feelings, but she isn't ethically wrong for pursuing a relationship that started naturally.\n"
