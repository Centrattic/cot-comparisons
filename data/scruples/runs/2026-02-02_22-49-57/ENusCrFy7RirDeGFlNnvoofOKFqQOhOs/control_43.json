His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21, and he's been dealing with depression. She's been helping him by suggesting he form a band again. She posted a flyer at her workplace, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, ended up joining the band. They connected through work, and after some interactions, their relationship escalated to texting. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mother and Joe are colleagues but from different departments. They didn't know each other well before. The mother's initial interaction with Joe was to help her son's band. However, their relationship progressed from work-related communication to personal texting. Ben is upset because he feels it's weird for his mom to date a friend, comparing it to if she dated his friend Matt. \n\nIs the mother in the wrong? Well, the dynamics here involve a parent and a colleague. There's no immediate conflict of interest if they are in different departments, but there's a potential for workplace issues if they start dating. Also, there's the aspect of Ben's feelings. The mother's actions might affect Ben's perception of her, especially since he's already been through a lot with depression. \n\nHowever, the mother might not have intended to date Joe initially; the relationship developed naturally over time. The question is whether she overstepped by pursuing a relationship with someone connected to her son. It's a sensitive situation because the son might feel his personal space is invaded, and the mother might feel she's entitled to her own life. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's no legal wrongdoing here. But socially, it's a gray area. The mother might be in the wrong if she didn't consider Ben's feelings or if there's a conflict of interest at work. On the other hand, if she's maintaining appropriate boundaries and the relationship is consensual, maybe not. The answer might hinge on whether there's a policy against workplace relationships, but since that's not mentioned, it's hard to say. However, Ben's emotional well-being could be a factor. If her actions caused him distress, even if unintentionally, she might share some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, she's a single parent who hasn't dated in years and found someone who's supportive. The relationship didn't start as a romantic one, so maybe it's not her fault. But Ben's reaction is valid too. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice, but she should handle it with sensitivity. However, some might argue she should have been more cautious to avoid making her son uncomfortable. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be B, but it's a close call. The main issue is whether the mother acted recklessly. Since she didn't plan to date Joe and the relationship developed gradually, it's more about personal boundaries and communication rather than being outright wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
