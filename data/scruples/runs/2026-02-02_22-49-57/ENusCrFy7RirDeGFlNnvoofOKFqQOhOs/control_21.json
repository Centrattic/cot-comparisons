His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a son, Ben, who's 21. She's been a single mother since he was a teenager. Ben has struggled with depression and is introverted, so she's trying to help him connect with others. He started a band with Joe, who was introduced through her. The author and Joe started talking at work, then got to know each other better, leading to a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the age difference, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the potential conflict of interest since they work together. But the author is 38, Joe is 29, so age-wise, it's not a huge gap. However, the dynamic between a mother and her son's friend could be complicated. Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but he's been lonely and relies on his mother for support. The mother's decision to date someone who's close to her son might make him feel like he's being replaced or that his well-being isn't the priority anymore. \n\nAlso, the fact that they met through work might raise some concerns about professional boundaries. The mother and Joe started interacting more outside of work, which could be seen as crossing a line. But the mother's intention was to help her son form connections, so maybe she didn't foresee this outcome. \n\nBen's reaction is understandable. Even though he's an adult, having his mother date his friend could feel like an intrusion on his social circle. The mother might not be in the wrong if her actions were genuinely to help her son and she's now forming a relationship as a result of legitimate interactions. But there's a moral consideration about how this affects Ben's feelings and their relationship. \n\nAnother angle is that the mother hasn't dated in a long time and is pursuing her own happiness. That's valid, but it's important to consider her son's perspective. Since Ben is an adult, he might have the right to express his discomfort, but the mother isn't obligated to stop seeing Joe just because Ben is upset. It's a balance between her right to date and Ben's right to feel supported. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother acted with her son's best interest in mind and whether the relationship with Joe was a natural progression of their interactions. If the mother didn't intentionally set out to date Joe for reasons unrelated to her son's well-being, then she might not be in the wrong. However, the situation is complex, and both parties have valid points. But according to typical AITA logic, the mother's actions, while understandable, might be seen as crossing a line by dating someone her son is close to, which could be harmful to their relationship. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since Joe was introduced as a way to help Ben, and the relationship developed naturally, it might be B (not in the wrong). I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
