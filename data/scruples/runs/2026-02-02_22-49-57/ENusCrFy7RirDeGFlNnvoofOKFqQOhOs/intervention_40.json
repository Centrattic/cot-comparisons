His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who has been a primary caregiver to her son, Ben, who's dealing with depression. She suggested he start a band again, and her colleague Joe, who's a friend of Ben's, joins the band. They start talking more, and eventually, a relationship forms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, Joe is 29, and they're colleagues but not in the same department. They met through Ben's band project. The key factors here are the existing relationship with the son and the potential conflict of interest. However, since they work in different departments, maybe there's not a direct conflict. But working at the same place could complicate things if they start dating, especially if the relationship affects the workplace environment.\n\nBen found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother argues it's different because Matt is his friend since middle school. But the question is about whether the mother is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, it's a personal choice. The mother isn't doing anything illegal, but it's a sensitive situation. The son's feelings are valid too. The mother might be crossing into a situation where her son feels betrayed or uncomfortable. However, the mother has her own life and needs to be happy. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother is Ben's parent, and dating his friend could be seen as a breach of trust. But Ben is an adult, so he's not a child anymore. However, the mother's role as a caregiver might still influence how Ben perceives the relationship. The mother's actions could affect her son's mental health, especially since he's been through depression. If this causes him distress, it's a valid concern. \n\nBut the mother isn't forcing Joe on Ben; Ben chose to be in the band with Joe. The mother's interactions with Joe started through the band, and their relationship developed naturally. The son's reaction is emotional, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. It's a personal matter where both adults are making choices. The answer might depend on cultural or personal family values. Some might argue the mother is in the right to date someone she's connected with, while others think it's inappropriate regardless. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, unless there are workplace policies against dating colleagues (which isn't mentioned here), there's no legal issue. Morally, it's subjective. The mother's perspective is that she's entitled to her own happiness, and Ben is an adult who should respect her choices. However, the son's feelings are important too. The author's actions aren't inherently wrong, but they should consider communication with Ben to address his concerns. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because there's no clear wrongdoing, but it's a complex situation where both parties' feelings need to be considered.\n"
