His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mother is dating her son's friend, which the son is upset about. The mother is a single parent, her son has been dealing with depression, and the friend in question became part of the band the son started. The mother and the friend started texting and the son is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's son, Ben, is 21 and the friend, Joe, is 29. They work at different departments but are colleagues. The mother introduced Joe to Ben's band, and then the two started talking more. The mother hasn't dated anyone since Ben's father left, so maybe she's lonely. The son is upset because he sees the relationship as crossing a line, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother argues that it's different.\n\nSo, is the mother at fault? Well, from a legal standpoint, there's nothing illegal here. But socially, it's a gray area. The mother is an adult with the right to date, and Joe is an adult too. However, the mother is Ben's parent, so there's a relationship of authority and trust. By dating a friend of her son, she might be affecting Ben's emotional well-being. But Ben is an adult as well, so he should have some autonomy. \n\nBut Ben was the one who introduced Joe into his circle, right? He was the one who wanted to start the band again, and Joe became part of that. The mother's interaction with Joe started through that context. She didn't necessarily set up a romantic relationship with him but got to know him through Ben's social group. When the texting started, it was after the son was running late. The mother might not have intended for it to go that way. \n\nThe key points are: Both adults involved, Ben is an adult too, but the mother is his parent. The son's reaction is based on feeling that it's weird because Joe is his friend. The mother's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary because Joe is part of Ben's life. However, the mother is also an adult who deserves her own relationships. \n\nBut is there any ethical wrongdoing? It's possible that the mother didn't consider Ben's feelings. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother has a responsibility to consider his well-being. However, the mother might argue that she's not doing anything wrong because she's not Ben's friend. The comparison the son made to dating his friend Matt shows he feels a similar relationship shouldn't exist between parent and child friend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, dating a child's friend can be seen as inappropriate because it can create tension and potentially affect the child's relationships. However, since Ben is an adult, it's a matter of personal choice and communication. The mother isn't in the wrong legally, but socially, there's a discussion to be had about boundaries. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since both parties are adults and the mother didn't force anything, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the son's feelings are important too. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice and both adults are involved. The son's feelings matter, but the mother isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond social boundaries, which vary. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and it's more about personal choice, the answer is B.\n"
