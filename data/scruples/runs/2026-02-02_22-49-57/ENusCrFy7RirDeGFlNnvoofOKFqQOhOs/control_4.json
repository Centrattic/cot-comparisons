His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a mother) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation involves her son Ben, who is 21, and his friend Joe, 29. The mother initially helped connect Joe to Ben's band, which led to Joe becoming part of the group. Over time, the mother and Joe started texting, and now Ben is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, and her son is 21. She's been a single parent, so maybe her emotional needs aren't fully met. She met Joe through the band, which was for her son's benefit. The initial interaction was work-related, but then it evolved into a personal relationship. \n\nThe key points are the age difference between the mother and Joe (38 vs 29) and the fact that Joe is a friend of her son. But Ben is an adult, so maybe his feelings are important, but he's not a minor. The mother isn't actively preventing her son from his relationships or interfering in his life beyond the band. She found a connection with Joe, and it's not like she was leading him on. However, Ben is upset because of the dynamic. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the mother should avoid dating a friend of her adult son to prevent conflict. However, Ben is 21, an adult, so technically, the mother isn't making Joe her son; it's her own choice. But there could be potential for tension in the household if Ben is uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't doing anything illegal. The relationship started after the son's friend was already part of the band. The mother initiated contact for the son's benefit, but then it became a personal relationship. The age difference isn't too large, and both are adults. The main issue is Ben's feelings, but since he's an adult, it's not like the mother can control that. \n\nLegally and morally, it's a gray area. The mother isn't in the wrong for pursuing a relationship, but she might need to consider her son's feelings. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms. In some views, dating a son's friend is not acceptable, but since both parties are adults and the mother isn't interfering with her son's life, it's her choice. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
