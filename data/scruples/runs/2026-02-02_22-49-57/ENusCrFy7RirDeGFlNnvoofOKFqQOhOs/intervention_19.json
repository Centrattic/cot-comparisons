His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a single mother, let's call her Sarah, who is 38 and her son Ben is 21. Ben has been struggling with depression and is introverted. He starts a band again, and through Sarah's help, connects with Joe, a 29-year-old coworker. Joe joins the band, and Sarah starts talking to him. Eventually, they start texting, and Ben gets upset because he thinks it's weird for his mom to date his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. Sarah is Ben's mother, so she's in a parental role. Joe is Ben's friend (and coworker of Sarah's). The key issue here is whether Sarah overstepped by dating Joe, who is Ben's peer. Ben is 21, and Sarah is 38, so there's a 17-year age difference between Sarah and Ben. Joe is 29, so he's only 8 years older than Ben. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, when a parent starts a relationship with someone who's a close friend of their adult child, it can create tension. Ben might feel like his mother is encroaching on his social life or that his mother is treating Joe more like a romantic interest than a friend. Even though Sarah wasn't intentionally trying to take Ben's friend, the situation is awkward from Ben's viewpoint. \n\nBut Sarah's intentions were to support her son by helping him form the band. She didn't start dating Joe immediately; it was after getting to know him through work and the band. The texts started when Joe asked for her number to help with a song, which seems like a legitimate reason. However, once they began texting more, it crossed into a personal relationship, which Ben didn't like. \n\nI need to consider the boundaries here. Sarah's workplace is separate from her son's social circle, but Joe is Ben's friend. Even though Sarah and Joe met through Ben's initiative, the relationship between Sarah and Joe could make Ben feel insecure or conflicted. Ben is an adult, so he can handle his own relationships, but having his mother date his friend is a sensitive situation. \n\nEthically, is Sarah in the wrong? If Ben is upset, then Sarah might need to consider his feelings. However, Sarah is also an adult with her own needs. The question is whether the relationship is inappropriate. Since Sarah and Joe aren't related by blood and they met through a mutual interest in Ben's band, it's not inherently wrong. However, the dynamic with Ben's friend could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the age difference. Sarah is 38, Joe is 29. Ben is 21, so Joe is only 8 years older than Ben, but Sarah is 17 years older than Ben. The age difference between Sarah and Joe is 9 years. That's not too significant, but the fact that Joe is Ben's peer might add to Ben's discomfort.\n\nIn terms of social norms, parents dating someone their adult child knows is not uncommon, but it can feel intrusive. The key factors here are whether Sarah initiated the relationship in a way that respects Ben's boundaries and if she considered how it would affect him. Since Ben found out and expressed discomfort, Sarah might need to address his feelings even if she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut is she actually in the wrong? If Sarah is an adult and Joe is an adult, and they met through a legitimate context (work and the band), it's not inherently unethical. However, the situation's sensitivity because of the connection to Ben means that Sarah's responsibility includes considering her son's feelings. If she started the relationship without considering Ben's perspective, that could be seen as a mistake. But if she's now aware of his discomfort, she should take that into account.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer hinges on whether Sarah's actions were considerate of Ben's feelings. If she didn't consider how Ben would feel and proceeded regardless, she might be in the wrong. However, if she's now willing to address Ben's concerns, her responsibility is to do that. But the question is whether she is in the wrong, not whether she should adjust her behavior. The initial act of dating someone who's a friend of her adult son isn't illegal or unethical, but it's a sensitive situation that could be seen as inappropriate depending on context. \n\nIn conclusion, while Sarah's actions might be a bit awkward, especially given Ben's history with depression and the potential for feeling neglected or replaced, the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. However, she might need to be more attentive to Ben's feelings. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No), because there's no inherent wrongdoing, even if the situation is uncomfortable for Ben.\n"
