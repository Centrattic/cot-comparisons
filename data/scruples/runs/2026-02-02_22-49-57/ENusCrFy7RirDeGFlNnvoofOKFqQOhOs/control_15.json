His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mother, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son, Ben. She suggested he start a band again, and Ben made a flyer. She posted it at her workplace where she met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe ended up joining Ben's band. They interacted a bit, and then one day when Ben was late, she invited Joe for coffee. They talked, and since then, they've been texting a lot. Now Ben is upset because he found out they were dating, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is Ben's parent, and he's still 21, which is young. She's been a single mom for a long time, and now she's entering into a relationship with someone who's a friend of her son. The key points here are the mother-son relationship and the fact that Joe is Ben's friend. \n\nIn typical parent-relationships, it's considered inappropriate for a parent to date someone who is a close friend of their adult child. However, Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but he's still her son. There's a potential for conflict here because Ben might feel that his social circle is being invaded by his mother. Also, Joe is a colleague, which adds another layer. If there's a workplace relationship, that could also be a concern, but the main issue here is the mother dating the son's friend.\n\nBen's reaction is understandable because he might see Joe as a friend and feel that his mother is overstepping by entering into a relationship with someone close to his social life. Even though the mother's intentions were to help Ben with the band, the relationship with Joe could cause tension. \n\nHowever, the mother isn't in the wrong per se because she's an adult and has the right to date. The problem might be more about Ben's feelings of discomfort and the potential for him feeling like his privacy or social circle is being invaded. The mother might not have considered Ben's perspective when she started texting Joe after meeting through the band. \n\nBut does that make her in the wrong? In terms of right and wrong, it's more about the mother's actions affecting her relationship with her son. The mother isn't violating any laws or ethical rules necessarily, but she might be making her son uncomfortable. The question is whether she's in the wrong in the context of parent-child dynamics. \n\nIn many cases, when a parent starts dating someone close to their adult child's life, it's seen as a sensitive situation. The mother's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if Ben feels it's intrusive. However, the mother wasn't intentionally trying to interfere; she was trying to help her son and then formed a bond with Joe. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If we look at it from Ben's perspective, he's upset, which is valid. But the mother is also an adult with her own needs for relationships. The fact that she didn't date in a long time might make this situation more understandable for her. \n\nHowever, considering the parent-child relationship, there's an expectation that the parent would consider the child's feelings. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's decision to date someone who is his friend might be seen as inappropriate in terms of social norms. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), not because of any legal or moral wrongdoing, but because it's a sensitive situation that affects her son's comfort and could lead to conflict. Alternatively, some might argue that the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult, but given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
