His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider various angles.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who had her son at 17. Now, her son Ben is 21 and has been dealing with depression. She wanted him to be happy and involved in a band again. She posted a flyer for him at work, where she met Joe, a colleague. Joe ended up joining Ben's band. Initially, they had a professional relationship because they worked together, but after some time, they started dating. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if she dated his other friend Matt.\n\nI need to think about the dynamics here. The main issue is the relationship between the mother and her son's friend. The mother's intentions were good\u2014she wanted her son to have friends and be happy. She introduced Joe to the band, which seems to have helped Ben socially. However, the mother's relationship with Joe could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially because they work together. There's a potential conflict of interest in their professional relationship. If they start dating, it might lead to complications at work, like favoritism or awkwardness among colleagues.\n\nAlso, the son's perspective is important. He's upset because it's his friend, and he might feel like his mother is overstepping. The age difference is also a factor\u2014Joe is 29, and the author is 38. While the age gap isn't huge, it's still a consideration in terms of maturity and life stages. The mother hasn't dated in a while, so this could be a fresh start for her, but the context of the son's friend adds complexity.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's responsibility as a parent. She needs to consider how her actions affect her son's well-being. If Ben is already dealing with depression and loneliness, this situation might complicate his emotional state. The mother's desire for a personal relationship is valid, but she might need to weigh it against her role as a parent and the potential impact on her son.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects of workplace relationships come into play too. Many workplaces have policies regarding dating between colleagues to avoid conflicts of interest. The author and Joe working in different departments might mitigate some issues, but it's still a consideration. If they continue the relationship, they should be aware of any company policies and how it might affect their jobs.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's intentions versus the son's feelings, potential workplace complications, and the impact on the son's mental health. While the mother's actions were initially motivated by wanting to help her son, the new relationship could have unintended consequences. The son's reaction is valid because he sees his friend being involved with his mother in a romantic way, which can create tension and discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, the situation involves several factors that suggest she might be in the wrong. The professional relationship with Joe, the son's emotional state, and the potential for workplace issues all contribute to the complexity. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship could lead to conflicts and might not be in her son's best interest, despite her good intentions.\n"
