His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started dating their son's friend is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She encouraged him to start a band again. She posted a flyer at her workplace, which led to Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joining the band. Initially, there's no issue because Joe is just a band member. Then, they start interacting more, leading to a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the mother-son dynamic and the introduction of a romantic relationship that involves the son's friend. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend of his. The mother argues it's different because Joe is her son's friend, not her friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, there's a potential conflict of interest here. Since Joe is Ben's friend, dating him could affect their relationship. Ben is still an adult, but the mother is in a position of influence over him, especially since she's been a single parent and he's been struggling with depression. The mother might be seen as overstepping by entering a relationship with someone close to her son.\n\nHowever, the mother is an adult, and Joe is also an adult. They chose to pursue a relationship outside of work, and the mother didn't initially have a relationship with Joe before Ben. The son's reaction is valid, given the close bond they have. But since both the mother and Joe are adults, their relationship is their choice. The mother isn't forcing this on Ben; she's just entering a personal relationship. The main issue is the potential for Ben to feel uncomfortable or neglected, especially given his mental health history.\n\nThere's also the aspect of workplace relationships. The mother and Joe work in different departments, but they started interacting through the band. If they are now dating, that could complicate their work environment. However, the user says they only met through the band and not at work before, so maybe the workplace policy isn't an issue here, unless they are now in a romantic relationship at work.\n\nThe mother might argue that she's allowed to date whoever she wants. On the other hand, Ben's feelings are important. He's 21, an adult, but given their history, he might need time to adjust. The comparison to dating a friend of his is different because the mother is Ben's parent. There's a different dynamic here. If the mother had dated a friend of Ben's, even as an adult, it could be awkward, potentially affecting their relationship. However, the mother is also an adult with her own life, and it's not uncommon for parents to date after being single for a while.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the mother not being in the wrong because she's an adult making her own choices, but there's an acknowledgment that it could create tension with her son. However, the user's own stance is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to consider that. The key is that the mother didn't set out to date the friend; it was a natural progression. The fault, if any, would be on Ben's side if he's not respecting his mother's autonomy. But since the question is whether the mother is in the wrong, and she's acting within her rights as an adult, the answer is likely B.\n"
