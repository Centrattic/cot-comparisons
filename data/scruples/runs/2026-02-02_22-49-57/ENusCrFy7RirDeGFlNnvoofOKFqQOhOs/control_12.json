His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who, after her son struggled with depression, helped him form a band by connecting him with a colleague, Joe. Over time, the mother and Joe started talking more, and their relationship evolved into something romantic, which the son found uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's intentions were to help her son, which is understandable. She wanted him to be happy and social, so starting a band seemed like a good idea. Introducing Joe into the son's life was part of that effort. However, the mother then developed a relationship with Joe, which the son found weird. \n\nThe key points here are the ages: the mother is 38, the son is 21, and Joe is 29. The son is an adult, so while he's still in college, he's legally an adult. The mother's age is also relevant because she's significantly older than Joe (17 years apart). The son's reaction is that it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. However, the mother argues that it's different.\n\nI should think about the potential issues. The son might feel that his mother is overstepping by dating someone so close to him and his circle. There's also the aspect of workplace relationships. The mother and Joe work together, which could complicate things if they were to date, even if they're in different departments. However, the mother didn't initiate the relationship with the intent to date; it evolved naturally through work and the band. \n\nAnother angle is the mother's responsibility towards her son. She's a single parent, and her son's well-being is a priority. If her dating life affects his mental health or happiness, that's a concern. But since Ben is an adult, he has the right to his feelings, but the mother also has the right to her own life. \n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. Factors include: the age difference, the workplace connection, the son's feelings, and whether the mother acted in bad faith. There's no indication that the mother intentionally set out to date Joe; it was a byproduct of helping her son. However, the son is still her child, and the relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, dating someone your adult child is friends with can be tricky. It's not illegal, but it could cause tension within the family. The mother might need to consider her son's feelings and whether the relationship is appropriate given the context. However, she's also entitled to her own happiness. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the mother didn't manipulate or force the relationship, and she's being respectful of her son's feelings, then maybe not. But if the son is still emotionally dependent on her, it could be problematic. The answer might depend on how the relationship affects the family dynamic. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing her own happiness, but she should be sensitive to his feelings.\n"
