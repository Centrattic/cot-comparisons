His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom, and Ben has had depression. She encouraged him to start a band again. Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined the band. They started talking more, and eventually, the mother started texting him, leading to Ben finding out and being upset. The question is whether the mother is at fault.\n\nHmm. Well, the mother's intentions were good\u2014supporting her son's interests, trying to help him make friends. She connected him with Joe, who became part of the band. The relationship between the mother and Joe started after Ben was already involved with the band, and they met through that context. But then their personal connection grew, which Ben found uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference between the mother and Ben, and the fact that Joe is Ben's peer. The mother is in a position of authority over Joe in a work context, although they work in different departments. That might create a power dynamic. Also, Ben is still an adult, but their relationship is close, and he might feel like his mom overstepped by getting involved with his friend.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, having a relationship with someone who is close to your adult child can be complex, even if both the parent and the new partner are adults. Ben might feel that his mom is intruding into his social circle. However, the mother isn't necessarily doing anything illegal or ethically wrong unless there's a conflict of interest at work. Since Joe is in the band with Ben, there's a social overlap, but the mother's relationship with Joe isn't directly affecting Ben's life in a negative way unless Ben feels it's a boundary issue.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's own personal needs. She hasn't been in a serious relationship since Ben's father, and connecting with Joe could be a way for her to find companionship. That's understandable. However, it's important to consider how her actions affect her son. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might have a responsibility to consider his feelings, especially since he's been through depression and might be more sensitive.\n\nI need to check if there's any conflict of interest. The mother and Joe work in different departments, so maybe not. But if they become a couple, could that affect their work environment? The user didn't mention any issues there, so maybe not. Also, Ben is now 21 and an adult, so his feelings are valid, but the mother isn't obligated to avoid dating someone who is his friend just because of that. However, the situation could be seen as awkward or intrusive from Ben's perspective.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no clear rule against this. The mother and Joe are both adults. The problem is more about the social dynamics and potential impact on Ben's well-being. If Ben is upset and this is causing tension in their relationship, the mother might need to address that with him, but it doesn't necessarily make her wrong for wanting to date someone she's connected with. \n\nHowever, the fact that she gave Joe Ben's phone number initially and then started a relationship might cross a line from Ben's viewpoint. It's possible that Ben feels his mom is taking someone from his social circle, which could be a valid concern. But since the mother's actions started as a way to support Ben's interests, maybe she didn't intend for it to go this way. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date someone she's connected with, especially if there's no conflict of interest. However, the situation is awkward because of the connection to Ben's social circle. The answer might depend on cultural or familial norms, but since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because there's no clear ethical violation, even if it's uncomfortable for Ben.\n"
