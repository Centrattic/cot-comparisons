His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who's been raising her son Ben since he was a baby. He's 21 now, and she's been dealing with his depression and trying to get him to make friends again by starting a band. She put up a flyer at her workplace, which is where she met Joe, a colleague. Joe ended up joining the band. They interacted professionally at first, but then started chatting more, leading to a personal relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a close friend from middle school. The author is now asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, key points here: the age difference between the author (38) and Joe (29) isn't that huge. But the main issue is Ben's reaction. He's 21, an adult, so does he have a say here? The author is Ben's mother, so there's a parental relationship dynamic. The son might feel that his friend is now being taken by his mom, which could create tension. But since Ben is an adult, maybe he shouldn't control his mom's dating life. However, the author's actions might affect Ben's comfort level and their relationship. \n\nAlso, the author didn't set out to date Joe; she met him through Ben's band, which is a bit of a gray area. If Ben is friends with Joe, then the author dating him might make Ben feel like her attention is now on Joe, affecting their bond. But Ben is an adult, so maybe he needs to handle his own feelings here. The author isn't in a relationship with Ben, so it's not like she's dating her son. However, the dynamic could be awkward, especially since Joe is Ben's friend. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position of authority at work, and Joe is her colleague. If she's dating someone at work, that could be a workplace issue. But the question is more about the mother-son dynamic. \n\nIs the author's actions harmful? She's an adult with the right to date someone. But Ben's feelings are valid too. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not doing anything illegal or unethical, and Ben is an adult, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's causing her son distress, maybe she should consider that. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see why. She's a single parent, and forming a relationship isn't inherently wrong. The responsibility might be on Ben to adjust, not her. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no hidden ethical issues here. Since both are adults, and the relationship isn't directly interfering with Ben's life beyond emotional discomfort, it's more of a personal choice issue. The author isn't violating any laws or explicit rules. So B is the answer.\n"
