His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The backstory is that the mother, who's been a single parent since she was 17 and her son is now 21, suggested he start a band again. She met Joe, a colleague, who ended up joining the band. They started talking, and now they're texting a lot. The son got upset because he thinks it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap, which is not too large. Legally, both are adults, so there's no issue there. The key points here are the relationship dynamics. The mother and Joe initially met through the son's band, and their relationship started as colleagues. But the mother is now developing a romantic interest in a colleague and a friend of her adult son.\n\nThe son is 21, which is an age where he's considered an adult, but given his history of depression and being introverted, he might feel particularly sensitive about his mother dating someone close to him. The mother's action of giving Joe the flyer and facilitating his involvement in the band might have created a situation where their relationship is intertwined with the son's social circle. \n\nNow, the main ethical question is about boundaries. The mother is a single parent who hasn't dated in a long time and is now forming a relationship with someone connected to her son. While the son is an adult and should have some independence, the mother's role as a parent might make the situation awkward. The son is upset because he feels it's similar to dating his friend Matt, but the context here is different because it's his mother dating someone he's friends with. However, since the son is an adult, he might not have the authority to dictate his mother's romantic life.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the son's well-being. If the son is already struggling with depression and loneliness, this situation could exacerbate his feelings if he perceives his mother's relationship as taking her attention away or creating tension. On the other hand, the mother's happiness is also important, and she hasn't dated since her son's father.\n\nI need to check if there's a conflict of interest or if the mother's actions could be seen as inappropriate. Since Joe is a colleague, there might be workplace boundaries to consider. The mother gave out Ben's number to Joe, which could be seen as stepping over a line if it's for her own benefit, but she did it to help Ben's band. The subsequent texting between the mother and Joe seems like a personal choice once the son is aware and okay with it.\n\nThe son's reaction might stem from feeling that his mother is now involved with someone he's friends with, which could create a rift. However, the mother isn't in the wrong for wanting to date someone new, especially if it's consensual and doesn't interfere with her parenting responsibilities. The key here is that the son is an adult, so the mother has the right to date, but she needs to be mindful of how it affects her son. If the son is upset, communication is necessary, but the mother isn't inherently in the wrong unless there's a breach of trust or harm caused.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the mother isn't in the wrong (B). The situation is complex, but as both the mother and Joe are adults, and there's no legal or clear ethical violation, it's more about navigating personal boundaries and the son's feelings. The mother's actions were initially to help her son, and developing a relationship with a colleague who's also part of her son's social circle isn't inherently wrong, though it requires sensitivity.\n"
