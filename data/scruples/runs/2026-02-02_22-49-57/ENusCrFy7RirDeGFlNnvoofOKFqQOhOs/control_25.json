His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 38-year-old single mom, who had her son Ben at 17, is dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and a colleague. Ben is 21 and has been dealing with depression. The mom ended up meeting Joe through Ben's band and now they're dating, which has Ben upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. The age difference is 17 years between the mom and Joe, which is significant but not unheard of. However, the key point is the relationship between the mom and her son. Ben is an adult now, but he's still in a situation where his mother is a major part of his life, especially since his father wasn't around. The mom might still be a primary emotional support for Ben, given his struggles with depression.\n\nThe fact that the mom and Joe met through Ben's band and that Joe is a friend of Ben's adds another layer. There's a potential conflict of interest here because if the mom dates Joe, it could affect Ben's relationship with his friend. Ben might feel like his mother is taking someone from him, especially if Joe was a source of support for Ben. The mom's actions in giving Joe Ben's contact info and then developing a relationship might have crossed a boundary, especially without considering Ben's feelings.\n\nAlso, the mom admitted that she hadn't dated in a long time, which might contribute to her not seeing the issue as clearly. But since Ben is an adult, the question is whether the mom crossed a line by entering into a relationship with someone who is part of her son's social circle. It's possible that the mom didn't realize how this might affect Ben, given that he's still adjusting to being an adult and dealing with mental health issues. The comparison Ben makes to dating his friend Matt from middle school is a way to highlight the similarity in his eyes, even though the situations might be different.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The mom is Ben's parent, and Joe is a colleague. There could be issues if the relationship affects their workplace, but the story doesn't mention any workplace issues. However, the main conflict is between the mom and her son. The mom's actions might have prioritized her own happiness without considering the impact on her son, which could be seen as selfish, especially since Ben is still vulnerable due to his depression.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, it's about boundaries within a family. The mom might not be wrong in a legal or strict moral sense, but socially and emotionally, it's a sensitive situation. The key here is whether the mom acted inconsiderately towards her son's feelings and well-being. Ben's reaction is valid because he might feel that his mother is encroaching on his friendships, which are important for his social life, especially given his tendency to be introverted and lonely.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential disruption to his friendships and emotional state. However, some might argue that she's not wrong because she's an adult and has the right to date, and Ben is also an adult who should handle it maturely. But given the context of Ben's mental health and the close relationship they have, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n"
