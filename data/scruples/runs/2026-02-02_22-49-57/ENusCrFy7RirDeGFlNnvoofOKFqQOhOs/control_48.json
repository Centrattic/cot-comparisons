His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother had her son Ben at 17, was a single mom, and now Ben is 21. He's been dealing with depression, and the mom has been supportive, taking him to therapy. Encouraged him to start a band again. The son made flyers, the mom posted one at work. A colleague, Joe, 29, saw it, joined the band. The mom and Joe started talking more, leading to a relationship that Ben found out about and is upset about. Ben compares it to dating a long-time friend, Matt, but the mom thinks it's different.\n\nSo the key points here are the mother-son relationship, the age difference (mom is 38, Joe is 29), and Ben's reaction. Legally, there's no issue here since they're adults. But socially and emotionally, it's a tricky situation. Ben is an adult too, so he can't control his mother's dating. However, the mother's actions might have impacted Ben's perception and comfort, especially considering his history with depression and being introverted. The mother might have crossed a boundary by getting involved with someone close to her son, which could make Ben feel uncomfortable or neglected. But the mother also has her own needs for social interaction and relationships. The question is whether the mother acted inconsiderately, even if it's not technically wrong.\n\nThe mother's intention was to support her son by helping with the band, which was a positive step. However, developing a relationship with a colleague who became her son's friend could be seen as overstepping. Ben's reaction is valid because it's a sensitive situation. The mother might not be in the wrong legally or morally since both are adults, but socially, she might have overlooked her son's feelings. The answer might depend on whether the mother considered Ben's perspective before pursuing the relationship. Since the mother claims she hasn't dated anyone since Ben's father, it's possible she's acting on her own needs, but the situation's delicacy requires sensitivity towards Ben's emotional state.\n"
