His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who, as a single parent, has been supportive of her son's interests. Her son is 21, and she's 38. The son was in a band that didn't work out, so she suggested starting a new one. She posted a flyer at her workplace, which is where she met Joe, a colleague. They connected over the band, and Joe joined. Over time, they started talking more, leading to a relationship. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend he's had since middle school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's actions were initially to support her son's interest in music. She facilitated the band by posting the flyer, which led to meeting Joe. The son's reaction is based on the idea that it's weird for a parent to date a friend of their son. But the mother is a grown adult, and Joe is an adult as well. The son is 21, so he's an adult too, but he's still in a sensitive position as the child of the mother in question.\n\nThere's a potential conflict of interest here if they're both at the same workplace, but the story doesn't mention any issues with that. The key points are: the mother's actions were initially for her son's benefit, she didn't have a relationship with Joe at first, and the son is upset about the new relationship. The mother is arguing that it's not the same as dating a lifelong friend (Matt), implying that Joe is just a friend of the son through the band, not a lifelong friend or a close friend in the same way Matt is.\n\nIs the mother wrong for dating her son's friend? From a legal standpoint, there's no law against adults dating each other unless there's a conflict of interest, but the story doesn't indicate that. However, from a social or familial perspective, there might be a perceived awkwardness. The son is upset because it feels like a betrayal, but the mother is an adult with her own life and the right to date. The question is whether the mother overstepped by dating someone connected to her son.\n\nAnother angle is that the mother's actions may affect her son's relationship with his friend. If the son is close to Joe, the relationship could create tension. However, the mother's intention was to support her son by helping him make friends through the band. The son's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't necessarily mean the mother is in the wrong. She's entitled to her own relationships, even if it causes her son discomfort.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person did something that's clearly unethical or harmful. The mother didn't do anything malicious. She met someone, and they started a relationship. The son is upset, but that's more about his feelings than the mother's wrongdoing. Unless there's a conflict of interest at work or legal issues, the mother isn't in the wrong. The son needs to adjust to the fact that his mother is an adult with her own life.\n"
