His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started dating their son's friend is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother who has been a single parent since her son was born. Her son is 21, dealing with depression and loneliness, and she suggested he form a band again. A colleague of hers, Joe, became part of the band. Initially, it was just the mother interacting with Joe because of the band, but then they started texting and developing a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's motivation for connecting with Joe was initially to support her son's interests. That's a positive step. However, the boundary crossed when the relationship shifted from professional or band-related to personal. The son found out and feels it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother argues it's different because Matt is her son's friend, not a colleague or part of the band. \n\nFrom a boundary perspective, the mother and Joe work together, which adds a layer of professionalism. Even though they work in different departments, the workplace is a sensitive area when it comes to personal relationships. The mother's role as a parent also complicates things. The son's reaction is understandable; he might feel that his mother is encroaching on a social circle he's trying to build independently. \n\nBut then again, the mother is a single parent who hasn't dated in a long time. Her emotional needs are valid. The key here is whether she acted appropriately. She gave Joe the flyer and encouraged him to join the band, which was in her son's interest. The transition from band-related communication to personal texting might be where the issue lies. However, the initial interaction was appropriate for the band context. The problem arises when the relationship goes beyond that scope without the son's awareness or consent.\n\nAnother angle is the son's reaction. He might feel protective of his mother's role and his own social boundaries. It's possible he's sensitive because of his past with his absent father and his current emotional state. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if her intentions were good. The workplace aspect is important because relationships between colleagues can lead to workplace complications, and the mother's role as a parent adds another layer. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's personal life is her own. She's entitled to relationships, especially if she's been single for a long time. However, the fact that Joe is her son's friend and a colleague might create a conflict of interest. The son's discomfort is valid, but the mother's actions in pursuing a relationship with a colleague and her son's friend could be seen as inappropriate, even if it wasn't her intention to make the son uncomfortable. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the mother might be in the wrong for not being aware of the potential impact on her son's feelings and the workplace dynamics. However, if her intent was purely to support her son and the relationship naturally developed, it's a gray area. The son's reaction is important here. If the mother didn't intend to date Joe and the texting was innocent, but the son feels violated, then it's a matter of communication. However, since the mother is now dating Joe, it could be seen as overstepping her role as a parent by entering a relationship that affects her son's social circle. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's intentions were good, the relationship with Joe as a colleague and her son's friend might cross ethical boundaries, making her at fault. So, Answer A.\n"
