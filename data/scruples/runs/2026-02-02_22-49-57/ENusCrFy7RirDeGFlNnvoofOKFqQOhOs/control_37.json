His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman is a single mother who had her son at 17. Now he's 21. She's been trying to help him with his depression, including suggesting he start a band again. The friend, Joe, joined the band. Initially, the mother and Joe just interacted about the band and work, but now they've started dating, which made the son upset.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. One is the mother-son relationship. Since she's a single mom, she might be very close to her son, and he's still in his early 20s. It's possible he's still looking to his mom for support, especially with his mental health. Dating his friend could make him feel uncomfortable or even threatened, which is why he's upset. But the mother might feel that she deserves her own happiness and that the relationship is separate from her son's.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. The son is 21. The age difference between Joe and the mother is 9 years, which is significant but not unheard of. However, the son is the same age as Joe. That could be part of the problem for the son\u2014dating someone his age might feel like an intrusion into his social circle.\n\nThere's also the dynamic of Joe being a colleague. If they work in the same place, there could be workplace policy issues. But the story doesn't mention any problems there, just that they started dating. Maybe the main issue is the son's reaction.\n\nEthically, the mother isn't violating any laws here, but socially, it's a sensitive situation. The son is an adult, so he can't stop her from dating, but the relationship might affect their relationship. The mother might need to consider her son's feelings, especially since he's still dealing with depression. If the son feels hurt or neglected, that's a valid concern. But the mother also has a right to her own relationships.\n\nIt's important to note that the son compared it to dating his friend Matt, but the mother might argue that Matt is her son's friend, not someone she's been close to. Joe is connected through the band, not her son's social circle in the same way. However, the son might still feel that the mother is overstepping by dating someone he's close to.\n\nI think the key points are respecting the son's feelings and considering the impact on his mental health. If the mother's actions are causing him distress, she might need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth the potential fallout. However, if she's happy and the son is just upset by the situation, it's a matter of balancing both their needs. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't in the wrong for pursuing her own happiness, but she should be mindful of how it affects him. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and based on the information given, there's no legal wrong, just a social dilemma. The answer is likely B.\n"
