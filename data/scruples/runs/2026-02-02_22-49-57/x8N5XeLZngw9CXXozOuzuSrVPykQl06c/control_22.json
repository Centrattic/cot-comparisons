I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation with their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time because they really value the weekends they have.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that specifies their time with the child. Unless there's a modification to that order, they aren't obligated to give up any time. The other parent's request is a change in the existing arrangement, which would typically require going back to court. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong if they refuse without the court's approval.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want to spend time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time more limited. But the current arrangement gives her 22 days out of 30, which is a significant amount. The author's time is 8 days, which is less. It seems like the original court order was designed to balance their time, but maybe the mother is asking for more because of her current circumstances. However, the author's attachment and the fun they have with their son are valid. They might be experiencing the child missing out if they give up time.\n\nI should also think about the best interest of the child. If the mother's school schedule is causing her stress and less quality time, maybe adjusting the schedule could help both parents. But the author isn't the one making the court order; they have to follow it unless changed. So unless there's a legal reason to comply, the author isn't at fault for not agreeing.\n\nAlso, the mother's request is unilateral. She approached the author directly, but any changes should go through legal channels. The author isn't required to negotiate their court-ordered time unless the court modifies it. So the author isn't wrong for not wanting to give up time. They can discuss with the mother to find a solution, but the court order is the binding factor here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and they're not obligated to give up their time without legal changes. The mother's request is valid, but the author isn't required to comply. So the answer should be B.\n"
