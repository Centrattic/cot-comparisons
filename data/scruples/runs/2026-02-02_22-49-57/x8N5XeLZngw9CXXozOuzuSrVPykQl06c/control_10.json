I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place that grants the father every weekend with his son. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's busy with school. The father feels he's already getting 8 days a month, while the mother has 22. He's reluctant to reduce his time.\n\nSo, legally, the father has a court order. The court order is a legal agreement, so unless it's modified by the court, he's obligated to follow it. The mother's request is outside the current court order, so the father isn't required to comply. Legally, he's not in the wrong here because he's following the existing custody arrangement.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the father is attached to his son and values the time they spend together. The mother, on the other hand, might be struggling with her own schedule (school), so she's asking for more time. But the father's argument is that the current split already gives him significantly less time than the mother. \n\nThe key points here are the legal standing of the court order and the existing custody terms. The father isn't violating any laws by refusing to give up his scheduled time. The mother would need to go through the legal system to request a modification, not approach the father directly. \n\nSo, unless there's a legal reason to modify the custody arrangement, the father isn't at fault for sticking to the court order. Therefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
