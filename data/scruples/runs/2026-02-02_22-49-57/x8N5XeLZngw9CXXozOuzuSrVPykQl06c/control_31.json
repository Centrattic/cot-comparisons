I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has a court order for every weekend with their son. The other parent, the baby mom, is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. She already has him 22 days a month, which he points out, compared to his 8 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, that's legally binding. The author is following the court order as it stands, so legally, he's probably not in the wrong. The mother is making a request outside of the existing agreement, which she might not be able to enforce without going back to court. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author mentions he looks forward to the weekends and they have fun. Parental bonding is important, and reducing time could affect that. The baby mom is in school, so maybe her schedule is tight, but the author's time is already minimal. The existing arrangement gives her the majority of time. It's possible she's struggling, but the author might not have the legal flexibility to adjust without consulting a lawyer or the court. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether he's the asshole for not wanting to give up time. The other parent has the legal right to more days, but the author's time is a scheduled part of the child's life. It's a balance between both parents' needs. Since the court order is already in place, the author isn't violating any laws. The baby mom's request might be reasonable, but he's not obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the court order exists, and he's adhering to it. The other parent needs to go through legal channels if she wants a change, not just ask. The author's desire to keep his scheduled time isn't wrong, especially given the existing arrangement.\n"
