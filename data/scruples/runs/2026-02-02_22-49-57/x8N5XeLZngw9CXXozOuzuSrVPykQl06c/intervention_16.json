I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court order for custody every weekend. The ex-partner is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The writer feels that giving up some time would leave them with even less time, considering the ex already has the child 22 days a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would need to be through legal channels. The parent is following the existing order, so legally, they aren't violating anything. The ex is asking for a modification, but the parent isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides otherwise.\n\nEmotionally, the parent values their time with the child and isn't willing to sacrifice it. It's understandable to want quality time, especially when it's limited. The ex's situation (being in school) is a personal challenge, but the parent isn't responsible for accommodating that unless the court modifies the arrangement.\n\nThe key points are the existing court order, the parent's right to their scheduled time, and the fact that the request isn't agreed upon. The parent isn't being selfish if the court order is already set. The ex should pursue legal changes if needed, but the parent isn't wrong for standing by their current schedule. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
