I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe person has a court order for every weekend with his son, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has the child 22 days a month, and he has 8. He's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to give up his time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. That's legally binding. So if the mother is asking for a change, she would need to go through legal channels to modify the order. The father's time is protected by the court, so he's not obligated to just give it up without a legal process. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school and it's hard to spend time with the child. But the current arrangement already gives her 22 days. Maybe she's not using that time effectively, but that's her issue. The father is entitled to his 8 days as per the court. \n\nThe father values his weekend time with his son and doesn't want to lose any. Since the court order exists, he's not in the wrong for standing by it. Unless there's a new court decision, he's within his rights. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's following the court order, and the mother needs to go through legal means to change the arrangement. It's not his responsibility to just give up his time without a legal modification."
