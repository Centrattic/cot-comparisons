I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong when refusing to give up every second weekend to the ex-partner. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the ex has the child 22 days a month and the father has 8. The ex is asking for every second weekend, which would reduce the father's time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody laws. In many places, court orders are legally binding and both parents are supposed to follow them unless changed by the court. The ex is asking for a modification, which would typically require going back to court. The father is within his rights to stick to the current order unless the court changes it.\n\nAlso, the father's time is already limited to 8 days a month. The ex's argument that she's in school might be a reason for needing more time, but the current arrangement might already be the court's decision based on what's in the child's best interest. The father's desire to maintain his scheduled time is understandable, especially since it's a significant portion compared to the ex's 22 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe the ex's request is reasonable. If she's in school, her schedule might be more restrictive, but the court order was set when they were separated. Maybe the father could consider some flexibility, but the court order is the main issue here. Without a court modification, the father isn't obligated to comply with her request. So, he's not in the wrong for not giving up his time as per the current order. The ex needs to go through legal channels to change the custody arrangement.\n"
