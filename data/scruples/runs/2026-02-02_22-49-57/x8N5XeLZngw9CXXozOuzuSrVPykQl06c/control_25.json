I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up their every second weekend with their son to the other parent. The court order gives them 8 days a month, and the other parent wants to take every second weekend, which would reduce their time. \n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. If the other parent is asking for a change, they might need to go through the legal system again. The current arrangement seems to be that the non-custodial parent has the weekends. The other parent has him 22 days, which is a significant majority. The person in question is resisting giving up their time, which is part of their court-ordered time.\n\nThe key points are: existing legal custody arrangement, the other parent's request is outside the current order, and the person is standing by their schedule. Since the court order is in place, unless there's a legal modification, the person isn't in the wrong. The other parent's situation (being in school) might affect her availability, but that doesn't necessarily justify reducing the custodial parent's time without court approval. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not the asshole) because they're following a court order and not giving up time without legal basis.\n"
