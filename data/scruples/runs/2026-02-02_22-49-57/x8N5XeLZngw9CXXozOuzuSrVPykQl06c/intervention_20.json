I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is resisting giving up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The other parent is requesting a change, but the author is not willing to. Since the court order exists, the author isn't legally obligated to give up their time without a court modification. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author is separated, which can be tough on both parents and the child. The other parent is in school, which might mean she's busy, but she already has the child 22 days a month. The author's time is only 8 days, but they value it and use it for fun activities. The author's child is three, so consistent time with both parents is important. However, the current arrangement is set by the court, which might have considered both parents' needs when it was established.\n\nThe other parent's request seems to be an attempt to adjust the schedule, but without going through the proper legal channels. The author is within their rights to maintain the current arrangement unless the court modifies it. The author's concern about losing time is valid because the current schedule is fixed by law. The other parent might need to petition the court for a change, but the author isn't at fault for not complying with an informal request.\n\nAlso, the emotional bond between the author and the child is important. The author mentions looking forward to every weekend and having fun, which suggests that the time is meaningful. Sacrificing that without legal necessity might not be reasonable. The other parent's situation is challenging, but the author isn't obligated to give up their court-ordered time. \n\nSo, considering the legal standing and the emotional impact on both parents and the child, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer should be B.\n"
