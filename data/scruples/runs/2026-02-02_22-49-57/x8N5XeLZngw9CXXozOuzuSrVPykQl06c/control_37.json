I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with his son. The court order states that he has the child every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. She currently gets 22 days a month, and he gets 8.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If both parents agreed to it, then they were both okay with those terms. The mother now wants to change it, but the father is resisting. The key point here is whether the existing court order is still valid and if there's a legal way to modify it. If the mother wants to make changes, she should probably go through legal channels rather than expecting the father to just agree verbally. \n\nThe father's concern is valid because his time is limited, and he's using the weekends to bond with his son. The mother's argument about her school schedule might be a legitimate reason to request a change, but it's up to the court to decide if the circumstances have changed significantly enough to warrant modifying the custody arrangement. \n\nSince the father isn't violating the court order by not agreeing to her request, he isn't the one in the wrong. The mother's request is her responsibility to handle through the legal system, not by pressuring him informally. The father has the right to maintain his court-ordered time unless a court decides otherwise. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
