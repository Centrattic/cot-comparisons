I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son every weekend. The ex-partner is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting because he feels he already has less time (8 days a month vs. 22) and doesn't want to lose any of his scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the author has a legally mandated right to his visitation. The ex is requesting a change, but unless the court modifies the order, the author isn't obligated to comply. So legally, he's not in the wrong because he's following the existing agreement.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The author clearly values his time with his son and looks forward to it. The ex's situation is that she's in school, which might be causing her stress, but she still has the child for the majority of the time. The author's concern is about maintaining his bond with his child, which is a valid parental concern. The ex is asking for more time without a legal requirement, but the author isn't required to give up his time.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the author should be more cooperative. However, the court order exists for a reason, perhaps to ensure both parents have time, but if the ex is seeking more time without legal changes, the author isn't at fault for upholding his rights. The key here is that the author isn't violating any laws or court orders by not giving up his time. The ex would need to go through legal channels to modify the order, not unilaterally ask for it. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
