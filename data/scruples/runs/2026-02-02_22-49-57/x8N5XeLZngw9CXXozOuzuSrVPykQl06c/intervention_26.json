I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The other parent, who has custody the rest of the time, wants to take every second weekend, reducing the original parent's time further. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should go through legal channels. The other parent is making a unilateral request, which the author isn't obligated to accept. Legally, the author isn't at fault for not complying.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The other parent is in school, so maybe that's a factor in their request. But the current arrangement already gives the other parent 22 days. The author's time is limited, and they value the weekends they have. It's understandable they don't want to give up more without legal changes.\n\nSocial norms and parenting responsibilities. The author is a separated parent, so maintaining a bond is important. The other parent's request might be reasonable, but it's important to follow the court order. The author isn't being selfish; they're protecting their legal rights.\n\nPossible issues: Could the author be seen as inflexible? Maybe, but the court order is the key here. Without a legal change, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The other parent should petition the court if they want modifications. So overall, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
