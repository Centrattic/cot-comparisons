I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son to the other parent.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place that grants the father every weekend for visitation. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resisting because he values his weekends with his son and they have a good time together.\n\nThe key points here are the existing court order and the mother's request. The court order is a legal agreement, so changing it would require going through the legal system again. The mother's argument is that she's in school, but she already has the child for 22 out of 30 days, which is most of the time. The father's time is only 8 days a month. The question is whether it's reasonable for him to not want to give up any of that time.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father isn't violating the order by not complying with the mother's request outside the court-mandated terms. Emotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother's situation (being in school) could affect her ability to spend time, but she's already the primary caregiver. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. \n\nThere's no indication that the father is being unreasonable or harmful by not giving up his time. The mother should probably discuss the matter through legal channels if she wants to modify the court order. So, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the existing agreement. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
