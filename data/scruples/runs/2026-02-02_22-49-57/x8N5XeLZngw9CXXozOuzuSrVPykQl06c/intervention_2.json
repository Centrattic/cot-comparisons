I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about child custody time. The parent (author) has a court order for every weekend with their son. The baby mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and has a hard time. The author feels they already have 8 days a month, which is less than the other parent's 22 days, and they don't want to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing the custody arrangement would require going back to court, right? The author isn't legally obligated to give up their time unless the court modifies the order. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for following the court order.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author is separated, and the child is with the other parent most of the time. The author looks forward to their weekends, which is understandable. The other parent is in school, but does that justify taking away the author's scheduled time? The author might feel that their time is non-negotiable, especially since it's set by the court. The other parent's request is out of their control unless the court intervenes.\n\nAlso, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to see if there's any reason the author would be. Maybe if the court order was supposed to be flexible, but typically, court orders are binding. The author isn't violating any laws by not giving up their time. The other parent's frustration is valid, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault for not complying with an informal request that goes against the court order.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the other parent's situation is more challenging, but the court already set the time. The author isn't obligated to give up their time. The answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
