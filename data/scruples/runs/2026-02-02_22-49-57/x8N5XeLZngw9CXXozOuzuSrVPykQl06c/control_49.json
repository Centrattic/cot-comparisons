I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The other parent, the baby mother, wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, changing it would typically require going through the court system. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily reduce his time, but he's not obligated to do so. The father's concern is valid because the court order is a legal document that both parties should follow unless modified. \n\nThe mother has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. The mother's reason is her school schedule, but she already has the majority of the time. Maybe she should adjust her schedule instead of taking away the father's court-ordered time. \n\nAlso, the father's emotional attachment is understandable. He looks forward to every weekend, and they have fun together. The key here is that the court order exists for a reason. The mother wants to alter it without a court modification, which might not be fair to the father. The father isn't in the wrong because he's upholding the legal agreement. The mother should seek a court modification if she needs changes, not unilaterally ask the father to comply. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is in place and the other parent is asking for a change without legal process. The father's rights under the court order should be respected unless modified by the court.\n"
