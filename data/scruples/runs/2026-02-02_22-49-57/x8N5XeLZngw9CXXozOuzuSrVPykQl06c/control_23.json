I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The parent has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The other parent can't just unilaterally change the custody arrangement without the court's approval. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong if they stick to the existing order.\n\nEmotionally and parentally, both sides have valid points. The other parent might feel she needs more time because of her studies, but the author is right that 8 days a month is less than half. The existing arrangement might already be unequal, but that's set by the court. The author's concern about losing time is valid, especially since the court order is in place.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author's ex approached them directly, which is understandable, but changing custody should go through legal channels. The author isn't obligated to negotiate outside the court. However, maybe there's a possibility for mutual agreement if both parents can find a middle ground, but the author isn't wrong for standing their ground here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following a court order, and the other parent hasn't followed proper legal procedures. The answer should be B (No).\n"
