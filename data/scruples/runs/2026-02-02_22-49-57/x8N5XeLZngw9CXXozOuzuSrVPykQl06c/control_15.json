I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has been separated since the child was born, three years ago. They have a court order for every weekend. The ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the son. The parent doesn't want to give up their time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a key point. If there's a legal agreement in place, both parties are supposed to follow it. The ex is requesting a change, but the parent is refusing. Since the court order is already established, the parent isn't violating anything by not complying with the ex's request. The ex would need to go back to court to modify the order if she wants a change. The parent isn't at fault for sticking to the existing arrangement. The ex's reasons about school might be valid, but that doesn't mean the parent has to sacrifice their time without a legal adjustment. The parent is protecting their time as per the court's decision. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
