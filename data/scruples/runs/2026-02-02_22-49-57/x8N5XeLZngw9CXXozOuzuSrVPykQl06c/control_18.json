I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son to the other parent. The situation involves a court order where the author gets every weekend with the child, and the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the custody arrangement is already determined. The mother is asking to modify the schedule without going through the legal process. Typically, changing a court order requires both parents to agree or a court to grant a modification if there's a significant change in circumstances. The mother's argument is that she's in school, but the court order might have already considered her circumstances when it was established. If she's in school, maybe that's part of her current responsibilities, but the existing order gives her 22 days a month, which is more than the author's 8 days. The author is concerned about losing time, which is natural for a parent.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child, but the author is standing by the court order. The mother's request isn't legally binding unless the court modifies it. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes outside the court. However, maybe there's room for negotiation, like adjusting the schedule in a way that still gives the father time, but the author might feel that any loss is too much. \n\nI should also consider custody laws. In many places, the court's primary concern is the child's best interest. If the current arrangement is working and there's no evidence that it's harmful, the court might not support changes. The mother's request might not meet the threshold for a significant change in circumstances. The author has a right to his time as per the order. \n\nBut maybe the mother is facing challenges because of her school schedule. If she's in school, maybe she's busy, but she still has 22 days. Perhaps the author could be more flexible, but he's not in the wrong for not wanting to give up his time. The court order is a legal document, and changing it shouldn't be done unilaterally. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. The court order is in place, and he's following it. The mother should seek legal means to modify the order if needed.\n"
