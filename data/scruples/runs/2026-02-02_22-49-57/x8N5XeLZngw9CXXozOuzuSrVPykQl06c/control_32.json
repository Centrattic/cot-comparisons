I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not giving up every second weekend with their son. They have a court order for every weekend, which gives them about 8 days a month. The mother wants to take every other weekend, but she already has 22 days. The user's time is set by a court order, so changing it would require legal changes. The mother is in school, making it hard for her to spend time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Without the court changing the arrangement, the user isn't in the wrong for following it. The mother's request is to alter the current setup without legal approval. The user's argument is that their time is limited and they value it. The mother having 22 days a month seems like a majority, so asking for more might be unreasonable. The user isn't violating the court order, so their stance isn't wrong. They might need to discuss with the mother or involve the court, but personally, they aren't in the wrong for sticking to their time as agreed legally. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
