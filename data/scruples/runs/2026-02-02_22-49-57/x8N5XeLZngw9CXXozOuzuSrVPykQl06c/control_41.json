I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent, the mother, wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. If the mother is asking for a change, she would need to go through the court to modify the custody arrangement. So, the author isn't obligated to agree without a court's decision. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the time split: the mother has the child 22 out of 30 days, which is about 73%, and the author has 8 days, around 27%. That's a significant majority for the mother. The author's weekend time is their primary time with the child. The mother's reason is her school schedule making it hard to spend time. But the current arrangement already gives her the majority. So, the author's reluctance to reduce their time could be seen as reasonable since they have less time to begin with.\n\nEmotionally, the author looks forward to every weekend and values the time they have. It's natural for a parent to want to maximize their time with their child, especially if it's limited. The mother's request might be based on her current challenges, but the existing court order is in place for a reason. Without a court modification, the author isn't at fault for not complying.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is the mother's request justified? Maybe she's struggling with her school and parenting, but the author isn't responsible for adjusting their schedule unless the court changes the order. The author's stance is about maintaining the legal agreement, which is their right.\n\nAnother point: if the mother is in school, maybe her time is less, but she already has the child most of the time. It might not be fair to take even more from the other parent. The author's time is precious, so not wanting to give it up isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a court order, they're protecting their legal rights, and the time split isn't equal. The mother's request isn't valid unless she goes through the legal process. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
