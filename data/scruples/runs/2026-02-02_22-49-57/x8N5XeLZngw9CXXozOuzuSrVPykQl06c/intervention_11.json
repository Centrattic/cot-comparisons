I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son every weekend. The other parent, the mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to balance. The father is reluctant to give up his time because he values his weekends with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document that outlines the visitation rights. Courts typically aim for fair visitation schedules, especially when it's in the child's best interest. If the mother wants to change the schedule, she would need to go through the legal system again, possibly modifying the existing order. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of court unless both parties mutually agree. So legally, he's in a good position here.\n\nEmotionally, the father is invested in his time with the son. The current arrangement gives him 8 days a month, which is less than the mother's 22 days. The mother's request is to take every second weekend, which would reduce his time by half. That's a significant reduction. The father's attachment and the importance he places on those weekends are valid. It's natural for a parent to want consistent time with their child.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school, making it hard to spend time with the child. However, the existing schedule already accounts for her having the majority of the time. If her school schedule is creating issues, perhaps she can adjust her own schedule or find other ways to spend time with the child without encroaching on the father's court-ordered time. It's possible that she's using her school as a reason to push for more time, which might not be fair to the father.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the current arrangement gives the mother more days, but the father's time is a crucial part of the child's life. Children benefit from having both parents involved, and reducing the father's time could have negative effects on the child's well-being. The father's resistance is about maintaining a bond and not being forced to sacrifice time that he has legally secured.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's approach. She approached him at drop-off, which might be a stressful time. Instead of discussing this through proper channels, like the court or legal representatives, she's asking directly. This could indicate that she's not following the correct procedures, which the father is right to question.\n\nIn summary, the father has a legal right to his visitation time, and the mother's request to reduce it without legal modification isn't something he's obligated to agree to. His desire to maintain that time is reasonable, especially given the established schedule. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
