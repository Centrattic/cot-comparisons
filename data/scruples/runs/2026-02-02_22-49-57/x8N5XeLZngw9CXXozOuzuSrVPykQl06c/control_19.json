I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So, the user and the baby mother have a court order that gives them alternating weekends with their son. The user is currently getting 8 days a month, and the mother is getting 22. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The user is resisting because he values his time with the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which is legally binding. If the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she would need to go through the court, not negotiate directly with the father. The father isn't obligated to agree to any changes outside the court's decision. So legally, he's not in the wrong by not complying with her request.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child, which is natural. The mother's argument is that she's in school, but she already has more time. The father's time is limited to weekends. The user is concerned about losing his time, which is only 8 days a month. If the mother is struggling with her school schedule, maybe she needs to find solutions within her own schedule rather than taking away the father's court-ordered time. \n\nAlso, the court order is meant to balance both parents' needs. If the current arrangement isn't working, the proper channel is to modify the order through legal means. The father isn't at fault for not agreeing to a change that hasn't been legally approved. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
