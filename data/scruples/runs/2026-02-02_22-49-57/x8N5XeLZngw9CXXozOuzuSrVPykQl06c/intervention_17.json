I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent, the mother, is asking the author to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't get enough time with the child. The author is resisting this change and is asking if they're an asshole for not giving up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. Since there's a legal agreement in place, any changes to custody typically require both parties to agree or a court modification. The mother is making a unilateral request, so the author isn't obligated to comply unless the court decides otherwise. The author's time is protected by the current order, so they aren't in the wrong for not agreeing without a formal change.\n\nNext, the custody split is 22 days for the mother and 8 for the author. The mother is in school, which complicates her time, but the author is already getting 8 days. The mother's request seems to be for more time, but the author's time is already limited, so it's understandable that they don't want to reduce their visits. The author's concern about losing time is valid since they look forward to those weekends and have a bond. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. Both parents likely want to spend time with their child, but the author isn't the one asking for a change here. The mother is initiating the request, so the author isn't at fault for not acceding. Unless there's a legal reason to modify the order, the author isn't in the wrong by sticking to the current arrangement. \n\nSo considering the legal framework and the emotional investment from both sides, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
