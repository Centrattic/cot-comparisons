I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get to see their son every weekend. The mother wants the author to give up every second weekend because she says she doesn't get enough time with the child and is in school. The author is resistant because they feel their time is already limited (8 days a month vs. the mother's 22 days). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The author has a court order in place. Modifying custody typically requires a court's approval, so the mother can't unilaterally change the arrangement. The author has a right to the time specified in the order unless there's a court decision otherwise. So, legally, the author isn't in the wrong by following the court order.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's a bit more complex. The mother is in school, which might make her time management challenging. However, the author's time is already a minority, and they're using it productively (enjoying time with their son). The mother's request could be seen as unreasonable if the court order is structured to balance their time. However, the mother's request might also be based on her current circumstances. But the court order is supposed to account for such factors. If the mother's situation has changed significantly (like going to school), maybe she should seek a court modification. But the author isn't obligated to agree without a court order.\n\nThe key point is that the author is adhering to the legal agreement. The mother's request is a personal one, and the author isn't required to comply unless the court decides so. The author's attachment to their time is understandable, and since the current arrangement is legally binding, they aren't wrong for not giving up their time without a court order. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
