I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son. The other parent is asking them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the visitation schedule is legally binding. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up some time, but the father is hesitant. Since the court order already sets the terms, the father isn't obligated to change it unless there's a court modification. So legally, he's not in the wrong here.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, it's about the child's best interest. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time more limited. However, the father's time is also important for the child's relationship. The current arrangement gives the mother 22 days and the father 8. If the mother has the majority of the time, maybe the father is justified in not wanting to give up his weekends. The child needs both parents, and the father's time is a crucial part of his life. \n\nAlso, the father mentions looking forward to the weekends and having fun with his son. That indicates the importance of that time for both of them. The mother's request is voluntary, not enforced by the court, so the father isn't obligated to comply. The mother could potentially seek a court modification if she feels the current arrangement isn't working, but that's a legal process. \n\nI should also consider if there's any imbalance. The father's time is already less, so giving up even more might be unfair. The mother's situation (being in school) is a personal circumstance, but the father's situation (limited time as per the court) is the established legal fact. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
