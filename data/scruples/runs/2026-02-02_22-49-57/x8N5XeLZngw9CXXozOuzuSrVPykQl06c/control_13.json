I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the father has the child every weekend. The mother, who has the child 22 out of 30 days, is asking the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and it's hard to spend time with him. The father is resisting because he values his limited time with the child.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Both parents are supposed to follow it unless there's a modification. The mother is making a request outside the existing agreement. The father's refusal could be seen as standing by his legal rights. However, custody arrangements often require flexibility. But the mother already has the majority of the time, so asking for even more might be unreasonable. The father's time is minimal compared to hers. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not violating the court order by not giving up time. The mother's request isn't enforced by the court yet. So, the father isn't at fault for not complying with an informal request. Also, the father's time is important for bonding. So, the answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
