I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets every weekend with his son. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid, even though she's already with him 22 days a month. The father is refusing to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, then deviating from it without mutual consent or a court modification might not be something either parent can unilaterally decide. The father isn't in violation of the order by not giving up time; the mother can't force him without a court change. So legally, he's probably not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which can be stressful, but she's still keeping the child 22 days. The father values his weekends. The key here is that the custody arrangement is already structured. The father isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court modifies it. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal necessity, the father's stance is about protecting his own time, which is valid as a parent. The mother's request seems to be a personal one, not enforced by the court, so the father isn't wrong for refusing. So the answer is B.\n"
