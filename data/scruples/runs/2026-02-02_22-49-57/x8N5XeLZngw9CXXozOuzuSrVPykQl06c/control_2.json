I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement of every weekend with their son, and the other parent is asking to switch every second weekend. The writer is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The parent has a court order that specifies their time with the child. Unless there's a court-mandated change, they can't just alter the agreement without the other party's consent. So legally, the parent isn't in the wrong for not giving up their court-ordered time. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child, which is understandable. The mother is in school and finds it hard to balance, but the father is also devoted to his son. The key here is that a court order is in place, which suggests that the initial arrangement was determined to be fair. The mother's request might be based on her current circumstances, but the father isn't obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. \n\nAlso, the fact that the father looks forward to the weekends and has a good relationship with the child is a valid reason for him to want to maintain his schedule. The mother's argument that she has 22 days versus his 8 is a bit misleading because 8 days is a significant portion of the weekend, but the exact split isn't standard (usually 50/50 or similar). However, the court order is the binding factor here. \n\nThere's no indication that the father's schedule is causing harm to the child, so his refusal isn't selfish but rather about maintaining the legal agreement. The mother should perhaps seek a legal modification if her circumstances have changed significantly, but that's not the same as the father being in the wrong for not complying. \n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is in place and he's not obligated to give up his time without legal change. The other parent's request isn't a valid reason for the father to sacrifice his court-ordered time.\n"
