I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the mother wants the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The court order currently gives the father 8 days a month, and the mother has the other 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The mother is asking him to change it without going through the court. Legally, modifying custody arrangements usually requires a court order, so the father isn't obligated to agree. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong for not complying with her request without court approval.\n\nNext, the fairness of the current arrangement. The numbers are 22 vs. 8 days. That's a significant difference. The mother does have more time with the child, but the father is separated and sees him only on weekends. It's possible that the current arrangement was set for a reason, maybe considering the father's situation at the time. However, the mother now claims she's in school and needs more time, but she already has 22 days a month. Maybe her argument isn't valid because she's already getting the majority of the time.\n\nEmotionally, the father looks forward to the weekends and values the time with his son. The mother's request could be seen as greedy if she already has the majority. The father's reluctance is understandable as he's trying to maintain his bond with the child. The mother should probably seek a legal modification if she's struggling, but can't force the father to agree without going to court.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother's school schedule makes it hard to manage 22 days. But she's still getting more time than the father. Also, the father isn't refusing all the time, just every second weekend. However, since the court order is in place, he's not obligated to change it. The mother's approach might be abrupt, not considering the father's feelings and the established schedule.\n\nIn conclusion, the father isn't wrong for not wanting to give up his time without a court modification. The mother's request is outside the current legal agreement, and the father is within his rights to hold onto the time he has. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
