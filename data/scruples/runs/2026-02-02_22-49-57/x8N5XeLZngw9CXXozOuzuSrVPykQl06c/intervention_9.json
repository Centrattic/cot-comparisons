I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard.\n\nSo, first, the court order is in place. That's a legal agreement. The other parent is requesting changes outside of that. The author is resisting because they feel their time is already limited. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I need to decide between A or B.\n\nThe key points here: the court order exists, the author is following it, and the other parent is asking for a change without going through legal channels. The author's time is 8 days a month, which is significantly less than the other parent's 22. The other parent's reason is that she's in school, but the author's time is already minimal. \n\nIn custody cases, the court typically considers the child's best interest, but in this case, there's an existing order. The author isn't violating anything by not complying with the request. The other parent should probably seek a legal modification through the court. The author has the right to stand by their current agreement unless the court changes it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up their time. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
