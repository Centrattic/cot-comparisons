I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement. The father has his son every weekend, which is 8 out of 30 days, and the mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and feels she doesn't have enough time. The father is resisting because he really values his time with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Modifying custody arrangements typically requires a court's approval, especially if it's part of a formal agreement. The mother's request to take every second weekend might require changing the existing order, which the father isn't willing to do without court involvement. So legally, he might not be in the wrong by not agreeing to the change unilaterally.\n\nThen there's the emotional and personal angle. The father clearly cherishes his time with his son, and the mother is in a different situation (school) which might be affecting her ability to spend time with the child. However, the initial custody arrangement was set because of their separation, and maybe the court considered both parents' circumstances at the time. The mother's current situation could be a valid reason to request a modification, but that should go through the legal system, not just an informal agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the father is an asshole for not giving up his time. The mother is asking for more time, but she already has 22 days a month. The father's time is important for their relationship, and he's not the one initiating the change. The mother should ideally take this up with the court if she wants a modification. So, the father isn't in the wrong for holding onto his court-ordered time. The answer should be B (No).\n"
