I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with a child after separation.\n\nSo, the person (the father) has a court order for every weekend with his son, which is 8 days a month. The mother is asking for every second weekend, meaning the father would have to give up some time. She has him for 22 days a month and is in school, making it hard for her. The father doesn't want to give up any time because he really looks forward to it and they have fun together.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification, both parties are supposed to follow them. The mother is requesting a change, but the father is resisting. The key here is whether the court order can be modified. The father isn't in the wrong if he's following the existing order unless there's a legal process to change it. The mother should probably go through the legal system to request a modification, especially since her circumstances changed (she's in school). But the father isn't obligated to agree without a court decision. \n\nThe father's argument is that he has less time as it is, and he's using the time they have to bond with his son. The mother having more time is part of the current agreement. The father not wanting to give up more without a court order isn't necessarily wrong. He's sticking to the legal arrangement. However, if the mother can prove that changing the arrangement is in the child's best interest, the court might adjust it. But the father isn't the asshole for not complying with a request that isn't legally binding yet.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The father isn't in the wrong. The mother needs to go through the proper legal channels to modify the custody arrangement, and the father is justified in holding to the current order until then.\n"
