I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend with their son. The mother wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author is resisting because they feel they already get 8 out of 30 days, and the mother gets 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the author has a legal right to their scheduled time. The mother is asking for a change, but the author is within their rights to not agree unless a court modifies the order. Legally, the author isn't wrong here.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author clearly values their time with the son and looks forward to it. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school, but she already has the majority of the time. The user mentioned the mother gets 22 days a month, which is more than the custodial parent typically has. So maybe the author's refusal is justified because the time is already structured, and the mother might need to adjust her schedule instead.\n\nAlso, the court order is there for a reason. If the mother wants changes, she should go through legal channels. The author isn't obligated to negotiate beyond that. The key here is that the author isn't violating the court order by not giving up time, so they aren't in the wrong. The mother's request seems to be about her own difficulties, but the existing arrangement might be fair as per the court's decision.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
