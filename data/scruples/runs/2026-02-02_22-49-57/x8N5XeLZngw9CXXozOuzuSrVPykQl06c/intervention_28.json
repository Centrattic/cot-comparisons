I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad has a court order for every weekend with his son, which gives him about 8 days a month. The mom wants him to give up every second weekend so she can have more time because she's in school and it's hard for her. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the time is legally set. The mom is asking for a change, so she would need to go through the legal process to modify the order. The dad isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. So legally, he's probably in the right by sticking to the current arrangement.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The dad sees his son every weekend and values that time. The mom is in school, which might make it harder for her to manage her time with the child. But she already has the child 22 days a month. That seems like a significant amount of time. Maybe she's not using it efficiently or there's another issue. But the dad's argument is that he's already getting the minimum, and giving up more would reduce his time even further. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the current split is 8 vs. 22 days. If he gives up every second weekend, that would cut his time in half, making it 4 days a month. That's a big drop. The mom is asking for something that would drastically reduce his time, which the dad is reluctant to do. \n\nAlso, the dad's desire to spend time with his son is valid. Parents naturally want as much time as possible with their children. The mom's request is understandable, but the current arrangement is set by the court. Unless the court changes it, the dad isn't in the wrong for not complying.\n\nSo, considering the legal order, the significant reduction in his time, and the inherent parental rights, the author isn't in the wrong. The correct answer should be B.\n"
