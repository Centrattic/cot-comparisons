I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and doesn't have enough time. The father is reluctant and feels like he's already getting 8 days a month, which is much less than her 22 days.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the father is wrong for not wanting to give up his time. The key points here are the court order and the existing custody arrangement. Since there's a court order in place, any changes should ideally go through legal channels. The mother is asking him to voluntarily give up time, but the father is holding onto his scheduled visits. \n\nThe father's argument is that the existing split is already 8 vs. 22 days. If he gives up every second weekend, that would reduce his time even more. The mother's reason is her school schedule, but the father is prioritizing his own time. \n\nLegally, unless the court modifies the order, the father is within his rights to follow the current arrangement. Emotionally, both parents likely want quality time with their child. The father isn't being unreasonable if the court order hasn't changed. The mother should perhaps seek a legal modification if she truly needs more time, rather than expecting the other parent to give it up on his own. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and he's not required to give up his time without a legal change. It's a shared custody issue, but the existing agreement is still valid unless modified.\n"
