I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent's custody time with their son. The parent has a court order that gives them every weekend with the child, which is about 8 days a month. The mother wants them to give up every second weekend so she can have more time, especially since she's in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, that's usually binding unless modified. The author isn't obligated to change their schedule unless both parties agree or the court modifies the order. The mother is requesting a change, but the author is resisting because they value their time and the current arrangement is set by a court.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school, making it hard for her to spend time with the child. However, she already has the child 22 days a month. The author's time is protected by the court order, so unless there's a legal reason to adjust it, the author isn't at fault for not wanting to give up their time. The key points here are the existing legal agreement and the emotional attachment the author has. The author isn't being selfish without reason; they're following a court order. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
