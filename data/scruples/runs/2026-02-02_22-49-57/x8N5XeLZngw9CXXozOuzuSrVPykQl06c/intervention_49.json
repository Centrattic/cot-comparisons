I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father not wanting to give up his court-ordered weekend time with his son. The mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The father argues that she already has the child 22 days a month, which is about 73%, and he only has him 8 days, around 27%. \n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification, both parents are supposed to follow them. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time, but he's resisting. The father's reasoning is that the current arrangement is already skewed in her favor. From a legal standpoint, he's not obligated to give up his time unless the court changes the order. \n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to his weekends with his son, which is understandable. The mother's argument is that her schedule (being in school) makes it difficult. But if the court order is already structured, the father isn't legally in the wrong by not agreeing to change without a court modification. The mother would need to go through the legal system to request a change, not approach the father directly. \n\nAlso, the father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. Sacrificing that without a legal requirement might be seen as unfair. The user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong, which aligns with the legal aspect. So, the answer should be B.\n"
