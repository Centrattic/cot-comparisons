I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The ex-partner (baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. The author is resisting giving up any time since they get 8 days a month and she gets 22. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legally binding document. The ex is requesting a change, but the author isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. Courts usually consider the best interests of the child when making custody decisions. The current arrangement has been in place for three years, so stability is a factor. The ex's reasoning is that she's in school, but she's already the primary caregiver with 22 days a month. The author's time is precious to them, and they're not willing to sacrifice it. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order stands unless modified. The ex would need to go back to court to request changes. The author's refusal isn't against the law. Emotionally, both parents want time with their child, but the author is protecting the time they have. The ex's request seems to be asking for a significant adjustment without legal justification yet. \n\nSocially, the community might sympathize with the author since the court order is in place and the author's time is limited. The ex's situation (being in school) is a personal challenge but doesn't override the legal agreement. There's no indication of neglect or harm in the author's current arrangement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
