I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the father gets every weekend (about 8 days a month) and the mother is requesting every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with her son. The mother currently gets 22 days a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Changing the custody arrangement typically requires modifying the court order, which usually needs both parties to agree or a court to determine that there's a significant change in circumstances. The mother's request to take every second weekend would mean the father loses some of his court-ordered time. Without the court's approval, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for not agreeing to this informal arrangement. The court order is binding, so altering it without legal process isn't valid.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The father clearly values his time with his son and doesn't want to lose any of it. The mother argues that she's in school and can't manage as much time, but she already has 22 days a month. The numbers show the father has significantly less time, so the mother's request might not be justified given the current arrangement. However, the mother's situation (being in school) might present challenges, but the existing custody arrangement might already account for that. If the mother's needs have changed significantly, she might need to seek a court modification, but the father isn't obligated to agree without that.\n\nThe key points here are the legal standing of the court order and whether the mother's request is a valid reason to change it. The father isn't in the wrong for refusing to alter his custody time outside of legal channels. He's within his rights to maintain the arrangement as per the court's decision. The mother should pursue a legal modification if she believes the current arrangement isn't working, but the father isn't at fault for not giving up his time voluntarily.\n"
