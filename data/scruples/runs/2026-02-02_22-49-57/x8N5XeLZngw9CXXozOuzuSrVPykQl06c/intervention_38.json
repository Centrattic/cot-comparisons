I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets his son every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The father doesn't want to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Unless there's a modification, he's supposed to follow it. The mother is asking for a change without going through the legal process. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong because the court order is binding. The mother would need to go through the proper channels, like filing a motion for modification, which requires showing a significant change in circumstances. The father isn't obligated to comply unless the court changes the order.\n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The father values his time with his son a lot, and it's understandable. The mother's situation (being in school) might be challenging, but she's already in the majority when it comes to custody days. 22 out of 30 days is a significant portion. The father's time is 8 days a month, which is less than a third. The question is whether the mother's request is reasonable. If the court order is set, and she's not following it without legal change, she's the one acting out of line. The father is protecting his legally entitled time, which is his right.\n\nAlso, the father's emotional attachment and the bond with his son are important. He's using the time effectively, and giving it up could affect their relationship. The mother's reasoning about her school schedule might be a factor, but if the current arrangement isn't working, the proper way is to seek a legal modification, not unilaterally decide to take more time.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the father is too rigid, or the court order is outdated. But the father doesn't have the obligation to adjust unless the court says so. The mother's approach is not following due process, so the father isn't in the wrong for holding his ground.\n\nIn conclusion, the father is not in the wrong because he's adhering to a court order and isn't required to renegotiate without legal changes. The mother should go through the proper legal process if she wants to modify the arrangement.\n"
