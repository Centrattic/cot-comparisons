I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels they already get 8 days a month, and she gets 22. They don't want to give up any time.\n\nFirst, the court order is important. If the court order is in place, then the parent time is legally set. The mother is asking for a change that isn't part of the current agreement. The author's response is about not wanting to lose time, which is their right as a parent. The question is about whether the author is wrong.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school and has less time. But the current schedule gives her more days. So maybe there's a misunderstanding about how the time is split. The author's time is every weekend, which is 2 days per week, but the mother has the child 22 days a month. Wait, 22 out of 30 days? That's about 3 weeks. So maybe the mother has the child during the week and the author on weekends. But the numbers need to be checked. If the author has every weekend, that's roughly 104 days a year. The mother would have the rest, which is about 260 days. So the mother already has significantly more time. The author's 8 days a month might be accurate if it's every other weekend. Wait, 4 weeks in a month, so if it's every weekend, that's two days each week, so eight days a month. The mother's 22 days would be the rest. So the author is in the minority here. The mother wants to take every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time to half, so four days a month. The author is resisting because they value the time they have. The court order is the key here. If the mother wants to change the arrangement, she should go through the court to modify the order. The author isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. The author's stance is about maintaining their legally established visitation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The mother is making a request outside the court's decision, and the author is justified in not giving up their time without legal changes.\n"
