I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and feels she doesn't get enough time. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the existing court order. Since there's a legal agreement in place, any changes would typically require modifying the order, which usually needs both parties' consent or a court decision. The mother has 22 days a month, which is more than half the time, so the father's 8 days are significant. The father is concerned about losing his scheduled time because he looks forward to it and values it. \n\nThe mother's request is based on her current school situation, but she's already got 22 days. Maybe she's struggling with balancing school and parenting, but the father's time is also important for the child's relationship with both parents. The father isn't being unreasonable in wanting to keep his time, especially since the court order is in place. Unless there's a valid reason for modification, like a change in circumstances affecting the child's best interest, the father isn't obligated to agree without legal process.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the father's refusal is justified. Since the court order is binding, he can't just give up time without agreement or court modification. The mother should pursue legal channels if she wants changes. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order.\n"
