I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their parenting time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the father has the child every weekend, and the mother is asking to have every second weekend to adjust for her school schedule.\n\nFirst, there's a legal aspect here. The father has a court order that sets his visitation. Courts typically aim for the child's best interest, so if the order is in place, it's legally binding. The mother is now requesting a change without going through the legal process, which might not be valid. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification.\n\nThen there's the balance of time. The father gets 8 days a month, and the mother has 22. That's a significant difference. The mother's argument is about her school workload, but the father's time is already limited. The key question is whether the father is being unreasonable by not giving up some weekends. The father's concern is valid because he's already getting much less time. The mother's request might not account for the existing imbalance.\n\nEmotional aspects matter too. The father looks forward to the weekends and they have fun together. The child's relationship with both parents is important, but the father's time is already scheduled. Without a legal change, altering that could disrupt the established routine. The mother should ideally seek a court modification if her circumstances have changed due to school, but she's not following that process.\n\nSo, considering the legal standing, the existing custody split, and the father's valid reasons for not wanting to lose time, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
