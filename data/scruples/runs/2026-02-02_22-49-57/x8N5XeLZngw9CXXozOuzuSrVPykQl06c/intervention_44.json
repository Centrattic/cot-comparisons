I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son to the other parent. The situation involves a court order that currently gives the mother 22 days a month and the father 8 days. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend, which would reduce his time even more.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document that both parties are supposed to follow. The father is within his rights because he's adhering to the existing arrangement. The mother is requesting a change, but the father isn't obligated to comply unless there's a legal reason or mutual agreement. The mother having the child 22 days a month is a significant portion, so the father's 8 days are a smaller share, but he's not violating anything by holding onto his scheduled time. \n\nThe father's perspective is that he looks forward to his weekends and has a bond with his son. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but the existing schedule already accounts for her 22 days. It's possible that the mother's current situation is causing her stress, but the father isn't at fault for not adjusting unless the court order is modified. \n\nThe key points here are the existing court order, the father's adherence to it, and the fact that the mother is requesting a change that the father isn't required to accept. Since the father isn't violating any legal terms, and the mother hasn't gone through the proper channels (like a court modification request) to adjust the schedule, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer should reflect that the father isn't the asshole here because he's following the law and not giving up time without agreement or legal necessity.\n"
