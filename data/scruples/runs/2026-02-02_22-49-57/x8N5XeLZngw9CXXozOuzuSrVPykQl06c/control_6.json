I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time. The parent has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent is asking to take every second weekend because she's busy with school. The parent in question doesn't want to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require modifying it. Unless there's a reason to believe the court order isn't being followed properly, the existing terms should be respected. The mother is asking without a court order change, so the father isn't obligated to comply. Legally, he's not in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder. However, the current arrangement gives her 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. It's a significant disparity. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. The mother's request seems to ignore the existing court decision.\n\nAlso, the father's perspective is that he looks forward to every weekend and has fun with his son. It's natural for a parent to want to maintain their scheduled time, especially when it's already structured. The other parent's situation might be challenging, but the court order isn't being followed here, so the father isn't violating anything.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps they could negotiate, like the mother taking some weekdays off when she's busy, but the father isn't required to give up his weekends. However, the question is about whether he's the asshole for not giving up time. Since the court order exists, he's not in the wrong. The mother should approach the court to modify the order if needed, not the father.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's following the court order and has a right to his scheduled time.\n"
