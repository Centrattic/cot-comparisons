I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend, and the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting because they feel they already have less time (8 days a month vs. 22) and they value their weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the author's time is legally set. Unless there's a modification to the order, the author isn't obligated to give up their time. The mother is asking, not demanding, but the court order is the key here. If the author is following the court's decision, then they're not in the wrong legally.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could be a valid reason for her to want more time, but the author is also attached to their weekends. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. The author's argument is that the current arrangement is already 8 days a month, which is less than the mother's 22, so giving up half of their weekends would reduce their time even more. That seems unfair from the author's perspective. \n\nBut maybe the mother's request is about quality time. If she's in school, maybe she's busy and wants to maximize her time with the child during her days. However, the author's time is protected by the court, so unless there's a mutual agreement or a court modification, the author isn't obligated. The mother should probably go through the legal system to request a change if she really needs it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legal right to their time. The mother's request isn't enforced by the court, so the author can decline. The answer is B.\n"
