I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants to take every second weekend because she's in school. The author is wondering if not giving up that time makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The other parent is asking to modify the schedule, but the court order is currently in place. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the court's decision backing their time with the child. Unless there's a legal process to modify the order, the author isn't obligated to give up the time.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is separated, so they might be feeling like they're already getting less time. The other parent has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the author's 8. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school, making time hard. But the author is concerned about losing their scheduled time. The key here is that the court order is a binding agreement, so unless there's a legal change, the author's time is protected.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, the author is not violating anything. The other parent should go through the legal system to request a modification if she's struggling. The author isn't at fault for not giving up time without the court's approval. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
