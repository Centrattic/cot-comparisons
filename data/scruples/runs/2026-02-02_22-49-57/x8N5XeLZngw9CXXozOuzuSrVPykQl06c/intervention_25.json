I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the mother wants the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The current arrangement is the father has the child every weekend, which is 8 days out of 30, and the mother has him 22 days. \n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. Court orders are typically enforceable by law, so any changes would require legal proceedings. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time, but he's not willing. The father's argument is that his time is limited and he values it, while the mother has the child the majority of the time.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless the court order is modified, the father isn't violating anything by not changing the arrangement. The mother's request is about wanting more time, but the father's existing time is already less than hers. The father's refusal isn't against the court order, so he's not in violation. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could make her time management harder, but the father's time is also precious to him. The key here is whether the father is legally obligated to change. Since the court order exists, and he's complying with it, he's not in the wrong for not giving up his scheduled time. The mother would need to go through the legal system to request a modification, not approach the father directly. \n\nSo the answer is B. The father isn't in the wrong for sticking to his court-ordered time. The mother's request is understandable, but the father's refusal doesn't breach the legal agreement. There's no indication of neglect or harm, just differing priorities on time allocation.\n"
