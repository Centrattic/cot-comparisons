I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get to spend every weekend with their son. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, the author's time is legally protected. The mother is asking to modify the arrangement, but that would require going back to court, right? So if the author's time is already set by law, they aren't obligated to give it up without a legal change. The mother's request might be reasonable if it's feasible, but the author has a right to their scheduled time.\n\nThen there's the emotional part. The author looks forward to every weekend with their son and they have a good time together. The mother is in school, which complicates her time, but the author's current schedule is 8 days a month, which is less than half. It's understandable that the author might feel this is already not enough and not want to reduce it further. Parental time is precious, and the author might feel it's important to maintain consistency.\n\nAlso, the mother's argument is that she doesn't get enough time, but she already has 22 days. Maybe she's not using the time effectively? Or maybe she's overextended with school. But the author isn't responsible for that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not agreeing to the request. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't violating anything by not complying. The mother should go through legal channels if she wants to change the arrangement.\n\nHowever, the author might be seen as being inflexible if the request is a temporary adjustment. But the problem is the court order. If the author's time is set, they can't unilaterally give it up. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They should handle it through the legal system if the mother wants a change.\n"
