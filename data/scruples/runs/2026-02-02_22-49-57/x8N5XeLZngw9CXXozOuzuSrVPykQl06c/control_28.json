I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement of every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should go through legal channels. The mother can't unilaterally alter the custody without the court's approval. The author isn't violating the order by not complying with her request. So legally, the author is in the right here.\n\nEmotionally and parentally, both sides might have valid points. The mother might feel she needs more time because of her school schedule, but the father is also attached to his son and values their time together. However, the existing arrangement already favors the mother with 22 days a month. The father's time is limited, and he's not obligated to give up more unless the court modifies the order. \n\nThe key here is that the mother's request is not part of the current legal agreement. The father isn't the one making the request; the mother is trying to change the terms. The father is maintaining his legal right to the time specified in the court order. So, from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, he's justified in wanting to keep his time with his son. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Are there any circumstances where the father might be expected to be more flexible? Maybe if there were a court-ordered adjustment or if the child's needs required it. But as per the information given, there's no such context. The mother should approach the court for modifications, not the father. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's adhering to the court order and has the right to maintain his scheduled time with his son.\n"
