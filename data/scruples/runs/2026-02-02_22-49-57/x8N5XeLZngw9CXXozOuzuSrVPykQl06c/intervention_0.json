I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is separated from their child's mother and has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the kid every weekend. That's 8 days a month, and the mother has him 22 days. So, the mother is asking to take every second weekend, meaning the author would lose half their time, right?\n\nThe author is being asked to give up time that's already legally set. The mother's reason is that she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. But the author already has a significant disparity in custody. The court order is in place, so changing it would require modifying the agreement through the court, not just one parent giving up time. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting to give up their time. The author has a legal right to their scheduled time. The mother's request seems to be coming from a place of wanting more time, but the current arrangement is already 22 vs. 8 days. The author's time is part of a court order, so they aren't obligated to give it up unless the court modifies it. \n\nThe author's feelings about looking forward to the weekends and having fun with their son are valid. The mother should ideally seek a legal modification if she's struggling, but the father isn't required to agree without court involvement. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
