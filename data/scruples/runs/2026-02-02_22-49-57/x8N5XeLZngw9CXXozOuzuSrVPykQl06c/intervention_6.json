I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend, and the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a binding legal document. If the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she would typically need to go through the legal system to modify the court order. The father isn't obligated to agree to any changes outside of the court's decision. So, legally, he's not in the wrong for not wanting to give up his time without a court's approval.\n\nEmotionally, the father looks forward to his weekends with his son and they have a good time. The mother, on the other hand, is in school and might be struggling to balance her responsibilities. However, the current arrangement gives her 22 days out of 30, which is a significant majority of the time. The father's time is much less, and he's already following the court's order. The mother's request could be seen as trying to take even more time, which might not be fair considering the existing arrangement.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the father could offer to adjust the schedule slightly if the mother is having a tough time, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for not giving up any time. Since the court order is in place, the father isn't at fault for not complying with the mother's request without legal changes. The mother's reasoning about her school schedule is her personal situation, but the court's decision should take precedence unless modified.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. The court order was likely established with the child's well-being in mind. Changing it without a proper legal process could disrupt that. The father's attachment and the time he has with his son are important, and reducing his time without a court's say-so might not be appropriate. So the father isn't in the wrong for holding to his legal rights.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother's request is reasonable, and the father should be more accommodating. But the key here is that the court order exists, and the mother hasn't gone through the proper channels to change it. The father isn't obligated to negotiate outside of that. So, unless the court decides otherwise, the father's stance is justified.\n\nIn summary, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is in place, and he's not required to give up his time without legal modification. The mother's request, while understandable, doesn't override the existing legal arrangement.\n"
