I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. She has the child 22 out of 30 days, and the father is resisting giving up his weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which is binding. The father isn't violating the law by following the existing order. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless there's a legal process to modify the custody. So legally, he's not in the wrong by sticking to the current arrangement.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the father is clearly attached to his son and values the time they have. It's natural for a parent to want to maximize time with their child. Since the court order already gives the mother the majority of the time, the father's reluctance to give up even more might be seen as reasonable. However, the mother's situation (being in school) might create scheduling challenges for her. But she's already receiving more time, so her request could be seen as asking for more than what's currently arranged.\n\nThe key points here are the existence of a court order, the significant disparity in time (22 vs. 8 days), and the father's emotional attachment. The mother wanting to adjust the custody should go through legal channels, not expect the other parent to agree without a formal process. The father isn't at fault for not complying with an informal request that would reduce his court-ordered time. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
