I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement. They get the child every weekend, which is 8 days out of 30, while the other parent has the child 22 days. The other parent is asking to take every second weekend, reducing the first parent's time to maybe 4 weekends a month. The writer is resisting because they value their time with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The parent has a court order, which is a legal document. Unless the court orders a modification, they are supposed to follow the existing arrangement. The other parent wants to change it without court approval, which might not be valid legally. So legally, the parent isn't in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The parent is attached to their time with the child. The other parent is in school and finds it hard to manage time. But the existing arrangement already gives the other parent more days. The parent in the post is not being unreasonable by sticking to the court order. They're not being selfish; they're protecting their scheduled time. \n\nPossible arguments against the parent could be about being flexible, but the court order is a binding agreement. Unless there's a mutual agreement or court modification, changing it unilaterally isn't right. The parent isn't the asshole for not giving up time without legal changes. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're following the court order and have a valid reason to value their time with the child.\n"
