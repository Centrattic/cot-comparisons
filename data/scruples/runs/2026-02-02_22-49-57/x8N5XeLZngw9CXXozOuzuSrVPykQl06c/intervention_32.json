I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The author has a court order that grants them weekend visitation. The mother wants to take every other weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels they're already getting 8 out of 30 days, which is less than half the time, and they cherish those weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, the author's time is legally protected. The mother can't unilaterally change the arrangement without court modification. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong by following the existing order.\n\nEmotionally and practically, the author is concerned about losing their limited time. The mother's argument is that she's busy with school, but she's already the primary caregiver with 22 days a month. The author's weekends are crucial for their bonding. The key here is that the mother is the one proposing the change, not the author. The author is resisting a request that would reduce their already limited time without a court's decision. \n\nAlso, the mother's situation might be challenging, but the author's time is part of a legal agreement meant to ensure both parents have regular contact. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to give up their scheduled time. The onus should be on the mother to adjust her own schedule if possible, or to go through the legal process to modify the order. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a legal right to their visitation time, and the request to reduce it comes from the mother without legal backing. The author's desire to maintain their scheduled time is valid and not unreasonable.\n"
