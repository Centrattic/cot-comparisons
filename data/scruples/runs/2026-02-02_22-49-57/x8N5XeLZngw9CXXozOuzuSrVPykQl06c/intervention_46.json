I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about parent-child time. The author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author isn't willing to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, changing it would require going through the courts, right? So the author isn't obligated to change the arrangement without the court's say. The other parent's request to take every second weekend would reduce the author's time from 8 to 4 days a month, which seems like a significant cut. The author is concerned about losing that time, which is understandable because they look forward to it and have plans with their son.\n\nThe other parent has the child 22 days a month. Wait, 22 days is actually more than half the month. If the author has 8 days, that's less than a third. But the other parent is asking for even more time. Maybe the court order was structured that way because of the separation right after birth. But now, the mother is in school, which might affect her availability. However, the author's time is fixed by a court order, so unless there's a violation or a court modification, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the existing arrangement.\n\nAlso, the author's emotional investment in the weekend time is valid. Parenting time isn't just about fairness in numbers; it's about the child's relationship with both parents. The author is maintaining their bond, and the other parent might need to find other solutions, like adjusting her schedule or seeking court intervention if she feels the current arrangement isn't working. But the author isn't obligated to negotiate unless the court allows it. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
