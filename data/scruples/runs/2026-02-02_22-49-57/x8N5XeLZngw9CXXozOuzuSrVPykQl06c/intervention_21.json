I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The current arrangement is the non-custodial parent gets 8 days a month, the other has 22.\n\nFirst, the court order is important. If there's a legal agreement in place, changing it would require going through the court. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up time, but he's not obligated to. The father's argument is that the current split is already 8 vs. 22 days, which isn't equal, so he's not willing to reduce his time further. The mother's reasoning is that her schedule is tough, but the father is maintaining his court-ordered time. \n\nThe key points here are the legal aspect and the fairness of the arrangement. Since the court order is set, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with a request that wasn't legally mandated. The mother's request might be based on her current circumstances, but the father's stance is about protecting the time he's already allocated. Unless the court adjusts the order, the father isn't obligated to change it. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the legal framework and the imbalance in time already, the answer would be B (No). The father isn't the asshole for not giving up his time when there's a court order protecting his rights. The mother should seek a legal modification if she wants a different arrangement.\n"
