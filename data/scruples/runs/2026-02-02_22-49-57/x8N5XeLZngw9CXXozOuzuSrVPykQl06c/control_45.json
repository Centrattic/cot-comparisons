I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The father is resisting because he feels he already gets 8 out of 30 days, and he doesn't want to lose any of that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He has a court order in place. If the mother wants to change the visitation schedule, she might need to go through the legal system, not just ask him directly. So if he's following the court order, he's on solid ground legally. The mother's request could require a modification of the order, which would need both parties' agreement or a court decision based on the child's best interest.\n\nFrom the father's perspective, he's been separated since the son was born, so three years. He looks forward to the weekends and they have fun together. The mother has him 22 days a month. That's a significant amount of time. The father's time is 8 days, which is roughly a quarter of the month. The mother is in school, which complicates her time, but she's the one with primary custody. If she's struggling, maybe she needs to adjust her schedule or seek other solutions instead of taking away the father's court-ordered time.\n\nThe father's resistance isn't about not wanting to help; he's standing by his legal rights. The mother's request is essentially asking him to give up his time without a legal basis. Unless there's a new circumstance that warrants a court modification, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying. The key here is that the court order is in place, and any changes should be made through legal channels, not unilateral decisions.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's protecting his legally established visitation rights. The mother's approach is flawed because she didn't go through the proper legal process. The father isn't being selfish; he's upholding his rights. The mother's problem with her own time management due to school doesn't justify taking away his time without legal backing.\n"
