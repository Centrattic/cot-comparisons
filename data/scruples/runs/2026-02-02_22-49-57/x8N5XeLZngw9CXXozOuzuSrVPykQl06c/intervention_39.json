I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son to the mother, who already has him 22 out of 30 days. The father has a court order for every weekend.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. So the mother is asking him to change the arrangement without legal input. The father's time is set by the court, so he's within his rights not to change it. The mother has the majority of the time, but she's asking for even more, reducing his time from 8 to maybe 4 days a month. That's a big cut.\n\nThe father is concerned about losing time with his son, especially since they have a good relationship. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and it's hard to find time, but she already has 22 days. Maybe she's not managing her time effectively, but that's not the father's problem. The court order is in place for a reason, possibly to ensure fair custody. \n\nSo the father isn't in the wrong because he's following the court order and the mother is the one requesting a change without legal process. The father has the right to his scheduled time unless the court modifies it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
