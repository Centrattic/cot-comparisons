I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court order for weekend visits with their son, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. Since it's a legal agreement, the author's time is protected. The other parent is requesting a change, but the author isn't obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. The current arrangement gives the author 8 days a month, which is less than the other parent's 22. That seems like a significant disparity, so wanting to keep the weekends makes sense.\n\nThe other parent is in school, which might be a temporary challenge. But the author's time is fixed by law. Parents might have different circumstances, but the court's decision is the baseline. The author's attachment to their time is valid; they look forward to weekends and have fun. The key here is that the other parent is asking for a change without legal backing. The author isn't the one initiating the conflict; they're maintaining their rights as per the order.\n\nPossible points to consider: If the other parent is struggling, maybe there's a middle ground, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up time. The court order is in place for a reason, perhaps to ensure the child has both parents. However, the other parent's request isn't necessarily justified without a court modification. So, the author's stance is reasonable. The answer should be B, No.\n"
