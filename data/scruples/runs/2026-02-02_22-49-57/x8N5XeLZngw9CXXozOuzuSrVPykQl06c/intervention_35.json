I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which gives them about 8 days a month. The other parent, the baby mother, wants every second weekend to herself because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is resisting because they look forward to their weekends and have a good time with the kid.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. Since there's a legal agreement in place, changing it would require mutual agreement or going through the court again. The mother is asking outside of that, so the father isn't obligated to comply. Also, the current arrangement gives the mother 22 days, which is a significant majority. The father's time is already limited, so giving up every other weekend would cut his time in half, which seems unfair. The mother's reason (being in school) is a personal challenge, but the father's commitment is also valid. The question is about parental rights and the existing legal framework. Without a court modification, the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the current order. So the answer should be B.\n"
