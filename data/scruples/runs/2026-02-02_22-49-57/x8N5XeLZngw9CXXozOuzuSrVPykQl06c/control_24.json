I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not giving up every second weekend to the other parent. The background is that they have a court order for every weekend, but the ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child.\n\nFirst, there's the court order. The author has a legal agreement in place, which is binding unless modified. The ex is asking for a change, but the author isn't obligated to agree without going through the legal process. So the author isn't breaking any laws by holding onto their time.\n\nThe ex's argument is that she needs more time because she's in school. However, the current arrangement gives her 22 days a month, which is more than double the author's 8 days. That seems like a significant disparity. The author is concerned about losing even more time, which is understandable, especially since they've been separated for three years already. The weekends are likely the only consistent time they get to bond with their son.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid. They look forward to each visit and have a good time. It's natural to want to maximize the time with a child, especially when the time is limited. The ex might have valid reasons for struggling with her schedule, but the author isn't at fault for not wanting to reduce their own time without legal changes. The ex would need to consult a lawyer to modify the court order, which the author isn't responsible for. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
