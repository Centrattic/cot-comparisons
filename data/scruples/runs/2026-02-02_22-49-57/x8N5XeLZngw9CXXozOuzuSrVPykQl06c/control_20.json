I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author is getting 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, modifying it would require going back to court. The court orders are usually based on the best interests of the child, and existing terms are legally binding. So unless there's a modification, the original terms stand. The other parent's request would need to be approved by the court again.\n\nFrom a parental rights perspective, both parents have a right to spend time with their child. However, the current arrangement is set by a court, so the author isn't obligated to agree to changes without legal process. The author is within their rights to maintain the existing terms. \n\nThe other parent's situation (being in school) might be a valid reason to request more time, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong for not complying. The author values their time with the child, which is understandable. The key here is that the existing court order is the legal framework, and the author isn't violating it by not giving up their time. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They are following the court order and have the right to maintain their scheduled time without the other parent's demands outside of legal channels.\n"
