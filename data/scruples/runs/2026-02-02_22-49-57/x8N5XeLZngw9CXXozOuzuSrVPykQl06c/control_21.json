I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son to the other parent. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the mother wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels that she already has the child 22 days out of 30, so they only get 8 days. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for not giving up more time.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the court order is valid. The author mentions they have a court order in place for every weekend. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification or a court case to change custody, the author isn't breaking the law by following the current order. The mother is asking to change the arrangement, but the author is resisting. \n\nNext, the time split: 22 days for the mother vs. 8 days for the father. That's a significant difference. The father is already getting a minority of the time. The mother is in school, which might be a factor in her ability to spend time, but if she's already getting 22 days, maybe the issue is how she's using that time or scheduling. The father is concerned about losing even more time. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father is adhering to the court order, so he's not in violation. The mother wants to change the arrangement, which would require going back to court. If the father doesn't want to agree to that without a court order, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, both parents want time with their child, but the father has a right to his court-ordered time. The mother's request could be seen as unfair if it's reducing his time without a court's decision. \n\nAlso, the father's attachment to the weekend time is valid. He's been separated since the child was born, so those weekends are crucial for their relationship. The mother's claim about not enough time might be valid, but she already has a majority of the time. The father isn't at fault for not agreeing to give up more without legal changes. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The court order is in place, and the mother hasn't modified it. The father has a right to his time, and it's reasonable for him to resist giving up more without a legal adjustment. The situation might need a custody review, but currently, the father isn't wrong for sticking to the existing order.\n"
