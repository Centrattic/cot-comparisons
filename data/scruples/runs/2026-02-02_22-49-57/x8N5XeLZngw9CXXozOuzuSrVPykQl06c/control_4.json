I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The other parent is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resistant to giving up any of their time and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the author's time is protected. The other parent can't unilaterally change the terms without going through the legal process. So the author isn't in the wrong legally. \n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The author mentions that they look forward to the weekends and have fun with their son. It's understandable to be protective of the time you get with your child, especially since it's only 8 days a month. The other parent's argument is that she's in school, but the current arrangement already gives her more time. The author might feel that their time is being unfairly reduced further. \n\nBut there's also the consideration of the child's best interest. Maybe the other parent needs the extra time for some reason, like balancing school and childcare. However, the current split is 22 vs. 8 days, which is a significant imbalance. The author's time is already much less, so giving up more might not be in the child's interest. \n\nAlso, the court order was established for a reason. If the other parent is struggling, she should seek a legal modification rather than asking the author to do it without court involvement. The author is within their rights to hold firm unless the court changes the order. \n\nPossible factors I might be missing: Maybe the original court order wasn't fair to begin with, but the user hasn't provided that info. Or perhaps there's a history of the other parent not following the order, but again, that's not mentioned. Without that, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up time. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a legal right to their visitation and are not obligated to give up time without court approval. The other parent should follow legal channels if she wants changes.\n"
