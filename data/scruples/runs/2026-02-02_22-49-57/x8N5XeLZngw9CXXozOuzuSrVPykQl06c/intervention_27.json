I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about parenting time with their son after a separation. The author has a court order that gives them every weekend with their son, and the mother wants every second weekend taken away from them. The author is resisting and doesn't want to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is a binding legal document. Unless modified by a court, both parents must follow it. The mother is asking for a change without going through the legal process, which might be a problem. The author isn't violating the court order by not giving up the time, so legally they might be in the right.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to their son and counts the weekends as precious. The mother's argument is that she's in school and it's hard for her. But the author already has 22 days with the child, which is a significant amount. The question is whether the author is being selfish by not conceding some time. But the original custody arrangement was set by a court, so unless there's a significant change in circumstances, altering it unilaterally isn't appropriate.\n\nThe key here is that the mother is trying to change the arrangement without legal approval. The author has a right to the time as per the court order. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the author isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. So the author isn't being an asshole for standing by the court order. Their attachment is valid, and they\u2019re not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
