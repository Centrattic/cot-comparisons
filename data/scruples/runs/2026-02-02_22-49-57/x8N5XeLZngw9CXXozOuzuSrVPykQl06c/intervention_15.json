I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. They have a court order that gives them every weekend. The mother wants to take every other one because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author feels that the mother already gets 22 out of 30 days, which is more than their 8 days. They don't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. If the current arrangement is legally established, then the mother's request would require modifying the order. The author isn't obligated to agree unless there's a legal change. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but the author points out that she's already with the child more days. That seems like a valid point. The author's time is limited and they look forward to it, so giving it up without a court decision might not be necessary. \n\nAlso, the mother's request could be seen as trying to adjust the custody without proper legal channels. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order. Unless there's a valid reason for the court to adjust custody, like harm to the child or significant life changes, the author isn't obligated to negotiate. The mother should seek legal advice to change the order if needed. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable here. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
