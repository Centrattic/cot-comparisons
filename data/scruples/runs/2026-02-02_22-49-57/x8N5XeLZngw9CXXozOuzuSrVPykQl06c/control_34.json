I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets his son every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order that specifies his visitation. The mother can't just demand changes without going through the legal process. So legally, he's probably in the right. Courts usually require a valid reason to modify custody arrangements.\n\nThen there's the emotional part. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might affect her ability to spend time, but she already has the child 22 days a month. The father's time is only 8 days, which seems less. The father's desire to maintain his time is understandable since he looks forward to it and they have fun together. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification.\n\nAlso, the term \"AITA\" is asking if he's the asshole. The mother is making a request, but the father is standing by his court order. Since he's following the legal arrangement, he's not acting selfishly without cause. The mother should approach the court to request a change, not the father. So, the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
