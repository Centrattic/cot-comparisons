I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order for the father to have the child every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time, even though she already has the child 22 days a month versus the father's 8 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to the custody arrangement should ideally go through legal channels. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes unless the court modifies the order. The mother's request is a significant shift in the current arrangement, which could affect the father's legal rights. So, legally, the father isn't in the wrong for not agreeing without court approval.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The father values his time with his son and looks forward to the weekends. The mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for her needing more time, but she already has the majority of the time with the child. The father's concern is about maintaining his relationship with his son. It's a balance between both parents' needs and the child's best interest. However, since the court order exists, the father isn't obligated to negotiate outside of that unless both parties agree or the court decides otherwise.\n\nThe key points here are the existing court order, the mother's request without legal modification, and the father's right to his scheduled time. The father isn't being unreasonable by holding to the court's decision. The mother should ideally approach the court for a modification if the current arrangement isn't working for her, rather than expecting the father to give up his time voluntarily. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with the request outside the court's parameters.\n"
