I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation involves a separated parent with a court-ordered custody arrangement. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend, arguing that she doesn't get enough time because she's in school.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. Since there's a legal agreement in place, the father isn't obligated to change it unless both parties agree or there's a court modification. The mother's request to take away the father's scheduled time would require altering the existing order, which isn't something either parent can unilaterally decide. The father's refusal isn't just about not wanting to give up time; it's about upholding the legal agreement.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school and struggling with time, but the father's schedule is fixed by the court. The father's current arrangement gives him 8 days a month, while the mother has 22. The father's concern is valid because the court order exists for a reason, possibly to ensure both parents have consistent time. The mother should ideally seek a court modification if she wants to adjust the schedule, not ask the father to relinquish his time without legal changes. \n\nThe father isn't in the wrong here because he's adhering to the court's decision. It's understandable that he values his time with his son, and the mother needs to follow proper legal channels if she wants to change the arrangement. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
