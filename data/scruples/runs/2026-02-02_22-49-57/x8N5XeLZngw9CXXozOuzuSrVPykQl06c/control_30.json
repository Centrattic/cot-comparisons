I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with their son after a separation. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend, reducing his time from 8 days a month to maybe 4, while she would have 22 days. The father is resisting, feeling that he shouldn't have to give up his court-ordered time.\n\nFirst, there's the legal aspect. The father has a court order for every weekend. The mother is asking him to voluntarily give up some time, but he's not obligated to do that. Courts typically aim for fair custody arrangements, but the current setup gives the mother a majority. However, the father's time is set by the court, so unless there's a legal reason to modify it, he's within his rights to hold firm. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might be struggling. The mother is in school, so maybe her schedule is tight. But the father has a fixed time he looks forward to, which is significant. The key here is that the mother is proposing a change, but the father isn't the one who initiated the request. The court order is in place, so unless there's a violation or a new court decision, he's not in the wrong for maintaining his time. \n\nThe mother's argument is that she doesn't get enough time, but she already has 22 days. That's a lot. Maybe the quality vs. quantity is an issue here, but the father's stance is about keeping his scheduled time. The mother's request is a voluntary adjustment, but he's not required to agree. \n\nSo, considering the legal framework and the fact that the father is adhering to the court order without violating any terms, he's not in the wrong. The mother might need to go through legal channels if she wants to modify the custody agreement, but the father isn't obligated to comply with her request without a court decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
