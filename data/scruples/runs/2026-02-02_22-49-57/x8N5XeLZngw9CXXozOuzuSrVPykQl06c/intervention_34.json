I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court order for every weekend visitation for their 3-year-old son. The other parent (the baby mother) wants the first parent to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to have time with her child. The first parent feels that the other parent already has the child 22 days a week and doesn't want to lose any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require legal steps. The first parent isn't obligated to give up their time without a court modification. Legally, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could be a valid reason for needing more flexibility, but the father is also attaching a lot of value to his weekends. The key here is whether the father is being unreasonable. Since the current arrangement is set by a court, the father isn't violating any legal terms by not agreeing. The mother should go through the legal system if she wants changes, not ask the father to give up time voluntarily.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, both parents deserve a relationship with their child. But the current split is 22 vs. 8 days. The father's time is already much less, so giving up another weekend would make it even more lopsided. The father's resistance is about maintaining his bond with his child, which is important. The mother's situation with school is a personal challenge, but that doesn't necessarily justify taking away the father's scheduled time without a court order.\n\nPossible arguments against the father: Maybe he's not being cooperative or isn't considering the mother's stress. But since the court order exists, he's within his rights. The mother isn't in a position to demand changes unilaterally.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The court order is the main factor here, and the father isn't at fault for not wanting to alter it without legal proceedings.\n"
