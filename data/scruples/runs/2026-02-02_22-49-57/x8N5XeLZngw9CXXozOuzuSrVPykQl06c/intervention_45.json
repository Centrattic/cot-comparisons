I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has court-ordered weekend visitation with his son after a separation. The mother is asking for every second weekend, which would reduce his time. The father is reluctant to give up any of his scheduled time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If there's a court order in place, both parents are legally bound to follow it. The mother's request to change the arrangement would typically require a court modification. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes without a court's approval. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong for sticking to the existing order.\n\nFrom an emotional and parenting perspective, both parents want quality time with their child. The mother is in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child, but the father's current schedule gives him 8 days a month. The mother having the child 22 days a month already seems like a significant majority. The father's resistance isn't unreasonable since he's already getting less time. There's no indication of any issues with his parenting abilities or the child's safety, so there's no obvious reason for the court to have given him less time in the first place unless there were specific circumstances.\n\nAlso, the father isn't being asked to relinquish all his time, just every second weekend. But if the court order is in place, the mother would need to go through legal channels to modify the custody arrangement. The father's stance is about maintaining the current schedule, which he's legally entitled to. The mother's request is a change that requires negotiation or court action, not unilateral agreement from the father.\n\nSo, considering the legal framework and the facts presented, the father isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up his court-ordered time without a legal process. The answer should be B.\n"
