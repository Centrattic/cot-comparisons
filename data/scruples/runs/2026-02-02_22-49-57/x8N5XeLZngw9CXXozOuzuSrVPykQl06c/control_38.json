I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, and there's a court order for visitation every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The father is getting 8 days a month, and the mother has 22. He's reluctant to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, then modifying it would require going through the courts. The mother's request is to change the current arrangement, but the father is sticking to the court order. That part seems like he's following the law, which is on his side.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the existing court order, the significant time disparity (22 vs. 8 days), and the mother's current situation with school. Even if the mother is struggling, the father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. The court orders are meant to be binding unless changed legally. So, he isn't in the wrong for not complying with her request outside the court's decision.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the father values his time with the son. The mother has more time as it is. The father's stance is about maintaining his scheduled time, which isn't unreasonable. The mother should probably approach the court to request a modification if she's facing difficulties. The father isn't the asshole for not giving up his time without legal changes. So the answer is B.\n"
