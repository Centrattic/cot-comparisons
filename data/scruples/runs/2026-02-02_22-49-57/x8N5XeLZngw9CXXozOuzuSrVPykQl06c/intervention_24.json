I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their scheduled time with their son during the weekends. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the author has the child every weekend (about 8 days a month), and the mother wants to take every second weekend (so the author would get half of his time). The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and finds it hard to have time with the child.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. Since there's a legal agreement in place, the author's time is protected. The mother is requesting a change without going through the legal process. Courts typically require both parents to agree to modify custody arrangements, or one can petition the court with valid reasons. The mother's request alone doesn't override the existing order unless there's a court decision.\n\nLooking at the numbers: the author has the child 8 out of 30 days. The mother has the child 22 days. The mother wants to take every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time by 4 days a month. That's a 50% reduction in the author's time. The author is resisting because they value their time, and the mother's reasoning (being in school) isn't enough to justify changing the court order without discussion or legal steps.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they look forward to the weekends and have fun with the child. It's important for both parents to have meaningful time, but the existing order is in place. The mother's approach of asking at drop-off might be abrupt, and she should consider the legal process instead of expecting the other parent to agree unilaterally.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is the binding agreement. The mother's request is valid in intent but not in method. The answer should be B.\n"
