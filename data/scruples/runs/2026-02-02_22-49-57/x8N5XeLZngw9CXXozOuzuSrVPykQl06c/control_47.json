I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The ex-partner (baby mother) is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting giving up their weekend time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, and any changes to custody arrangements typically require court approval. If the ex is asking for a change, the proper process would be to go through the courts, not directly to the other parent. So the author isn't obligated to agree just because the ex is asking. The author's stance that they don't want to lose their scheduled time is valid because the court order exists for a reason, ensuring both parents have defined time with the child.\n\nNext, the numbers: the ex has the child 22 days a month, and the author has 8. The ex's request is for every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time from 8 to 4 days a month, while the ex's time increases from 22 to 26. That's a significant shift. The author's argument is that they already have less time and are making sacrifices to have the weekends. The fact that the ex is in school might affect her ability to spend time, but the existing schedule already accounts for her majority time. It's possible that the ex is not adhering to the original arrangement, but the author is within their rights to stick to the court order.\n\nEmotionally, the author's connection with their son is important. The fact that they look forward to the weekends and have fun together suggests that the time is meaningful. The author isn't being selfish if the court order is in place. The ex's request might be reasonable, but it's not enforceable without a court modification. The author isn't the one violating the agreement; the ex is making a new request without legal backing.\n\nPotential factors to consider: Was the court order established with the current circumstances in mind? If the ex's situation has changed (school), maybe she should seek a court modification. But until then, the existing order stands. The author isn't wrong for not complying with an informal request. The key here is that the author is respecting the legal agreement, while the ex is trying to alter it without going through the proper channels. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
