I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The parent in question (the author) is resisting giving up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that grants them time every weekend. Court orders are legally binding, so unless the order is modified by the court, the author isn't violating any laws by following it. The other parent's request to have every second weekend would require a change in the existing order, which typically needs a court's approval. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the current agreement.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author has consistent time with their son, which is important for their relationship. The other parent is in school, which might be a valid reason for needing more time, but the author's time is already limited. The key point is that the other parent is asking for a change without going through the proper legal channels. It's possible that the baby mother is frustrated, but the author has a right to their visitation as per the court order.\n\nAlso, the ratio mentioned is 22 days for the mother and 8 for the father. While that might seem unequal, it's important to note that the court order is in place for a reason. If the mother's schedule has changed significantly (like starting school), that could be a factor for a court to consider modifying the order. But the father isn't obligated to agree without a court decision.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should work towards the child's best interest. However, the author is sticking to the legal agreement. The baby mother should approach the court if she needs changes, not the other parent directly. The author's attachment and enjoyment of their time are valid, and they shouldn't feel pressured to give up their court-ordered time without legal necessity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the court order. The baby mother's request is a matter that requires legal process, not unilateral agreement. The answer should be B.\n"
