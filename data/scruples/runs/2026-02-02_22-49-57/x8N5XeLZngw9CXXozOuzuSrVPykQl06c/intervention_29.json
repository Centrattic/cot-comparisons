I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement of every weekend with his son, and the other parent, the baby mother, is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is saying that he doesn't want to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means it's a legally binding agreement. Changing custody terms usually requires court modification, especially if it's a significant change like giving up every second weekend. The existing order states the parent has 8 days a month, and the other parent has 22. The court would have considered the best interests of the child when setting this arrangement. So, the author isn't legally wrong for not complying with the request since it's not part of the court order.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The father values his time with his son and looks forward to the weekends. The mother is in school, which complicates her time. However, the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time. The father's reluctance might stem from wanting to maintain his bond with the child. It's also possible that the mother's request is based on her current challenges, but the father is standing by his legal rights.\n\nThe key points here are respecting the court order and the father's right to his scheduled time. Without a court modification, the father isn't obligated to give up his time. Additionally, the father's emotional attachment and the child's relationship with him are important. The mother might need to explore other solutions, like adjusting her schedule during the school week or seeking additional support, rather than asking the father to give up his custody time.\n\nSo, considering the court order and the father's valid reasons for not wanting to lose his time, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The father isn't violating any legal terms, and the mother's request isn't enforceable outside the court order. The father's stance is reasonable, especially if the court hasn't modified the arrangement.\n"
