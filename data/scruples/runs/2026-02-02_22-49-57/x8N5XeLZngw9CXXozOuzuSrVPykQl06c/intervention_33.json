I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get every weekend with their son. The other parent, the baby mother, wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is reluctant to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that specifies their time. The other parent is asking for a change, but the author is not obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the existing arrangement.\n\nThen there's the fairness and emotional aspect. The author only gets 8 days a month, which is about a quarter of the time. The other parent has the child 22 days. The author values their time and enjoys the weekends with the kid. The other parent's reason is that she's in school and struggling, but the author might feel that their time is already minimal. It's a balance between both parents' needs. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't at fault for not renegotiating without legal changes. The other parent should probably petition the court for a modification if she needs more time, but the author isn't obligated to agree without that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
