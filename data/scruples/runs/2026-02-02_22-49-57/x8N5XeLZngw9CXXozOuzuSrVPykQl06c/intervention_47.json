I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parents are separated, with a court order giving the father every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and has less time. The father feels he has a good relationship with his son and doesn't want to reduce his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The mother is requesting a change, but the father is resisting. Courts usually consider the child's best interest, and modifying a custody order requires a valid reason. Since the mother is in school, maybe she's busy, but the father's current schedule gives him 8 days a month, which is significant.\n\nThe father's argument is that his time is precious. He sees his son every weekend and they have fun. The mother has the child 22 days, so the father's request isn't unreasonable. The court order was established for a reason, and changing it might not be necessary if the current arrangement works. The mother's request could be seen as self-serving if she's not facing a critical hardship, but she does mention being in school, which is a valid challenge.\n\nHowever, the father isn't in the wrong here. He's upholding the court order and valuing his time with his son. The mother should seek legal means to modify the order if she thinks it's necessary, but the father isn't obligated to agree. The answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
