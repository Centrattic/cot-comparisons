I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up every second weekend with his son. The situation is that the parents are separated, with a court order granting the father every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and struggling to spend time with the child. The father is resisting because he values his time with the son and has a court-ordered schedule.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the mother wants to change custody arrangements, she should approach the court, not the father directly. The father has a legal right to his scheduled time unless the court modifies it. The mother's request is reasonable in intent\u2014she wants more time\u2014but the way to handle it legally is through the court system. The father isn't obligated to agree to this change outside of court. \n\nThe father's concern is valid because his time is limited, and he's been following the court order for three years. He's not the one initiating changes; he's responding to the mother's request. There's no mention of the father violating the court order or the son being harmed. The father's priority is his relationship with his son, which is understandable. \n\nThe mother's situation (being in school) is a personal challenge, but that doesn't automatically entitle her to more time unless the court adjusts the arrangement. The father isn't in the wrong unless he's violating the court order, which he's not. The key here is that custody modifications require legal action. Since the father is standing by his legal rights without violating the order, he's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
