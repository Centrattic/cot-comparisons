I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about custody time with their son.\n\nFirst, the background: the person has a court order for every weekend, separated for 3 years. The ex-mother (baby mom) wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has the kid 22 out of 30 days, and the father has 8. The father is reluctant to give up his time because he looks forward to it and they enjoy their weekends.\n\nThe key points here are the existing court order, the current custody split, and the mother's new request. The father's question is whether he's an asshole for not wanting to give up time. \n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer (A or B) based on whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider legal aspects and the context. The father already has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. The current split is 22/8 in the mother's favor. If she's already the primary caregiver (22 days), and the father is getting 8, which is less than half, maybe the mother's request to take every second weekend (so reducing the father's time from 8 to maybe 4 days a month) is problematic. \n\nBut why is the mother in school? That might affect her time. However, does the father have any responsibility to adjust? It's possible the mother should address this through the court if she wants modifications. The father's current arrangement is based on a court order, so without a formal change, he isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the father's emotional investment and the child's bond with him is important. If the mother is the primary caregiver, maybe the time the father has is already less, and he's not at fault for wanting to maintain that. The mother's request might not be fair if the court order already sets the terms. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The court order is in place, and the father isn't obligated to give up time without a modification. The mother should seek legal changes if needed, not expect the father to agree unilaterally.\n"
