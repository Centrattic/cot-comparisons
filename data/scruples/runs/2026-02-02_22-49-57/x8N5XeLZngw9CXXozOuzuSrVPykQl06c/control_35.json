I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspects here. The court order is a key point. Once a court order is in place, changing it typically requires going back to court. So the mother can't just demand changes outside of that. The author's time is legally set, so he's not obligated to give up time without a court modification.\n\nNext, the numbers: the other parent has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the author's 8 days. The author's time is limited, and they value it highly. The other parent's reasoning is that she's in school, making it hard to find time. But the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. If she's struggling, maybe she should seek a legal adjustment rather than expecting the other parent to just give up time voluntarily.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to his time with the child and doesn't want to lose any. That's understandable. Parental rights on both sides need to be respected. The other parent's request seems unfair given the current court order. The author isn't the one violating the agreement; he's following the court's decision.\n\nPotential legal consequences if the author gives up time without a court order? Maybe not immediately, but if the other parent were to take it to court later, the original order would still stand. The author isn't in the wrong for not complying with an informal request that changes the court's decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
