I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. They have a court order for every weekend. The mother wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. She already has 22 days out of 30, and the author gets 8 days. The author doesn't want to give up any time because they look forward to it and have fun with their son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. If there's a court order in place, that's legally binding. So unless the court modifies the order, both parties have to follow it. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up some time, but the father isn't obligated to do that. He's within his rights to stick to the court order. The mother's request is based on her own convenience, but the existing custody arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The father might feel that his time is limited and important, especially since they were separated since the child's birth. \n\nThe father's perspective is that he's using his allocated time and doesn't want to reduce it. The mother's argument about being in school might be a reason for her to need more time, but if she's the one with custody most of the time, maybe she's the one managing the logistics. Also, the father's time is every weekend, which could be crucial for bonding. \n\nI should check if there are any legal obligations here. Since the court order is in place, unless modified, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with the mother's request. The mother might need to go through the legal system to request changes, not just ask the father. \n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong for refusing to give up his time. The answer should be B (No). He's sticking to the court order and prioritizing his time with his child, which is valid. The mother's request is understandable but doesn't override the existing legal agreement.\n"
