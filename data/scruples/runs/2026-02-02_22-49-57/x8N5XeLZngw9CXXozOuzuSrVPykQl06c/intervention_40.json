I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the baby mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The author is resisting because they only get 8 days a month and value that time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. If it's in place, the author is following the law by sticking to it. The other parent is asking for a change, which would require modifying the court order. That's a legal process, not something either can just agree on verbally. The author isn't legally obligated to give up time unless the court modifies the order.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the current arrangement gives the mother 22 days and the father 8. The father's time is less, but he's making the most of it. The mother's request is out of her own scheduling issues, but she's already getting the majority of the time. The author's stance is about maintaining his own bonding time with the child, which is important for both emotional and legal reasons.\n\nPossible factors to consider: The father's time is already limited, so taking away even more could affect the child's relationship with him. The mother's schooling might be a temporary situation, but she's using it as a reason to take more time. However, the father isn't in the wrong for not agreeing unless there's a legal modification. The answer hinges on legal compliance and the father's right to his court-ordered time. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's upholding the existing agreement. So the answer is B.\n"
