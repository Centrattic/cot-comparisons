I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. They have a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The other parent has 22 days out of 30, while the author has 8.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document, so the author is probably following the law. The other parent is asking for a change without a court modification. The author's time is limited, and they value it a lot. The key here is whether the author is legally or morally obligated to give up their time. Legally, since there's a court order, the other parent would need to request a modification through the court, not just ask. So the author isn't in the wrong for not complying. Morally, maybe the other parent's situation is tough, but the author's time is also important. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about legal or ethical obligation. Since the author isn't violating the court order, they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
