I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son as the mother requested. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place for the father's visitation: every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has 22 out of 30 days, while the father has 8. The father is reluctant to give up any of his time since he looks forward to it and they have a good time together.\n\nI need to consider family law principles here. Typically, child custody arrangements aim for the child's best interest, balancing both parents' needs. The current court order is a legal agreement, so modifying it would require mutual consent or a court modification. The mother's request might be valid if she's struggling with her school schedule, but the father's time is also protected by the court order.\n\nThe father's perspective is that he values the time with his son, which is understandable. The mother already has significantly more time (over two-thirds of the month). If she's in school, maybe there's a structural issue affecting her time, but the father's time is limited. Legally, changing the court order without a valid reason or mutual agreement might not be feasible. The father isn't obligated to give up his time if the court order is in place. Emotionally, both parents have valid feelings. The father not wanting to lose time isn't necessarily wrong. The mother might need to address her scheduling issues without encroaching on the father's legal rights. So, the answer is likely B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
