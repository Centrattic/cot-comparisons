I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Modifying custody arrangements usually requires going through the legal system. The mother's request is a change to the existing agreement, so she should probably take it up with the court, not just ask the father to agree. The father isn't legally obligated to comply with her request unless the court orders it.\n\nThen, the time division: 22 days vs. 8 days. The father's time is significantly less. The mother has the majority of the time, so asking for even more might be unreasonable. The father's perspective is valid because he's already getting less time and looks forward to every weekend. The mother's current situation (being in school) might affect her time, but maybe she can adjust her schedule instead of taking away the father's time.\n\nAlso, the father's emotional bond with his son is important. Losing time could affect their relationship. The mother should consider that. However, the father isn't in the wrong because he's following the court order. The mother needs to address this through proper channels. The father's refusal isn't selfish in this context; it's about maintaining his relationship with his child as per the existing agreement.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's adhering to the court order and has a right to his scheduled time. The mother should seek legal modification if she wants changes.\n"
