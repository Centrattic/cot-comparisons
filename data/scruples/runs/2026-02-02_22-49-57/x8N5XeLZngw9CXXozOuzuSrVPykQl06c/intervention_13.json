I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend with their son, but the baby's mother wants every second weekend back because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author gets 8 days a month, and the mother gets 22. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legally established custody arrangement, then changing it would require going through the legal system. The mother's request seems to be outside of that court order. The author is within their rights to follow the court order unless it's modified. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could make her time more limited, but the author is also trying to maintain their bond with the child. The key here is that the mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up time without a legal change. The author isn't obligated to do that. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, and I agree. The answer should be B, No. The author is not in the wrong because the court order is in place, and they're not required to alter it without legal process.\n"
