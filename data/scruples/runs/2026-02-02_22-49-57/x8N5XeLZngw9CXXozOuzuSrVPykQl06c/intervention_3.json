I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. They have a court order that gives them every other weekend, so about 8 days a month. The ex wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and struggling with time. The author is resisting because they don't want to lose any time with their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so the current arrangement is legally binding. The ex is asking the author to voluntarily give up their time, which the author isn't obligated to do. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here because the court order already establishes their custody rights. The ex would need to go through the legal system to request a modification, not just ask the author.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author clearly values their time with their son and looks forward to it. The ex is in a difficult situation with school, but the court order already gives her the majority of the time. The author's refusal isn't about denying the child time, but about maintaining their own scheduled parent time. It's important to balance both parents' needs, but the author isn't being unreasonable if the court order is set. \n\nAlso, the ex's request isn't framed as a temporary adjustment but as a permanent change every second weekend. The author might feel that their time is already limited and that giving it up would be unfair. The key here is that the author isn't refusing to be flexible if the situation required a legal adjustment, but the ex is asking for a personal concession without legal grounds. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author's current arrangement is already the minimum allowed by law, but the user didn't mention that. However, the main point is the court order exists, so the author isn't violating any legal terms by not complying with the ex's request. The ethical question is whether the author should be more flexible. But since the current setup is already set by the court and the ex is asking for a personal sacrifice, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their rights. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
