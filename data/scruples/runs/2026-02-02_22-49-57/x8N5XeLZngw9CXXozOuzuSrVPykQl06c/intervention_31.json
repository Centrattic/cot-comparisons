I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent (the author) has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the mother, wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting because they feel they already have less time (8 days a month vs. 22) and don't want to lose any of their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody laws. Generally, custody arrangements are decided by the court based on the child's best interest. If there's a court order in place, changing it typically requires going back to court, not just an agreement between the parents. The author is within their rights to follow the court order unless there's a legal modification. The mother's request might not be valid unless she gets a court to alter the existing order.\n\nThe author mentions they look forward to every weekend and have fun with their son. That's emotional but relevant. The mother's argument about not enough time is subjective. Even though she has more days, the quality of time matters. But the author's time is limited by the court order. If the mother is struggling with her time, maybe she should address that with the court instead of asking the other parent to give up their scheduled time.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is separated and the custody is already set suggests that the current arrangement was determined legally. The mother's request to take every second weekend without court involvement seems out of line. The author isn't obligated to negotiate outside the court order. So, the author isn't in the wrong for following the existing custody agreement and not giving up their time without legal changes. The answer should be B (No).\n"
