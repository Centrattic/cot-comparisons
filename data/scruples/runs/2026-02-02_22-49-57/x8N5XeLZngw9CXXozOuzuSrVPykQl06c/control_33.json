I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement of every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resisting because he doesn't want to lose any of his time.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. If there's a legal custody arrangement, either parent changing it unilaterally isn't valid unless there's a court modification. The mother's request to take away his scheduled time without court approval would be a violation of the existing order. The father's refusal to comply isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place for a reason, possibly to ensure both parents have consistent time with the child unless there's a compelling reason to change it.\n\nThe mother's argument that she's in school and needs more time might not be sufficient to alter the custody arrangement without legal proceedings. Courts typically consider the child's best interest, which includes stability and maintaining relationships with both parents. If the current arrangement is working and there's no evidence of harm, the father is justified in upholding his rights as per the court order.\n\nAdditionally, the numbers mentioned: she has him 22 days a month, which is about 73% of the time, while he has 8 days, around 27%. That's a significant disparity, so the father's scheduled time is a smaller portion. The mother might need to go through the court to request a modification, which would involve showing a substantial change in circumstances. The father isn't at fault for not agreeing to give up time without legal process.\n\nSo, considering the existing court order and the mother's unilateral request, the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
