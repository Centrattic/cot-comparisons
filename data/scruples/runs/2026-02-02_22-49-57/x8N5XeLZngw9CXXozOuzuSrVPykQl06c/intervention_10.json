I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, and the other parent is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not wanting to give up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The other parent is asking for a change, but the court order isn't something either parent can unilaterally alter. So if the author refuses, it might be within their legal rights. However, maybe the other parent can request a modification through the court if her circumstances have changed. But the author isn't obligated to agree without a court order change.\n\nThen there's the emotional and relational aspect. The author is a parent who values their time with the child and is making the most of it. The other parent is in school, which is a valid reason for time constraints, but she already has the child 22 days a month. The author's time is 8 days, which is significant, but maybe less than ideal for the other parent. However, the author is not in the wrong for not wanting to give up their time. Both parents have rights, and the court order is meant to balance those. The author isn't being unreasonable in sticking to the current arrangement unless the court order is modified.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often looks at fairness and empathy. The author seems to be in a position where they are holding onto their right as per the court. The other parent's request is understandable but doesn't automatically make the author in the wrong. The key here is that without a legal change, the author isn't obligated to comply. The other parent should go through the proper legal channels if she wants a modification.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
