I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to lose any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Changing the custody terms would typically require going through the court again. The mother can't just unilaterally take more time unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong because the existing order is in place.\n\nThen, there's the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder. However, the father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. The user's question is whether he's wrong for not giving up time. \n\nThe mother has the child 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. That's already a significant majority. If the father gives up every second weekend, that would reduce his time even more, which might not be fair. The court's original decision probably considered both parents' situations, so changing it without legal process isn't right.\n\nAlso, the father's perspective is that he looks forward to every weekend and has fun with his son. It's important for the child to have a relationship with both parents, but the father's time is structured by law. The mother should probably seek a legal modification if she needs changes, not just ask the father to give up time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong because he's following the court order and the mother needs to go through the proper legal channels for any changes.\n"
