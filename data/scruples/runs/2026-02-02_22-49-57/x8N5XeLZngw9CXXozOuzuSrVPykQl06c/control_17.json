I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the father has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she says she doesn't have enough time with the child, even though she already has 22 days a month compared to his 8. He doesn't want to lose any time and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place. Typically, custody arrangements are legally binding, and any changes would require mutual agreement or a court modification. The mother's request would need to go through the legal system if she wants to change the existing order. The father isn't obligated to agree unless the court orders it.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, both parents might feel they need more time. The mother is in school, which could complicate her schedule, but the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time. The father values his time, which is understandable. The key here is that the court order exists for a reason, maybe established to ensure both parents have time with the child. The mother's unilateral request to change it without legal process might not hold weight.\n\nAlso, the father isn't being selfish without cause. He's sticking to the agreed-upon schedule. The mother's argument that she's in school might not justify taking away the father's court-ordered time without legal steps. So, the father isn't in the wrong by not agreeing. The answer would be B, No.\n"
