I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up every second weekend with their son. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the baby mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school. The author feels they already have less time (8 days vs 22) and don't want to lose more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so unless there's a legal reason to modify it, the author isn't obligated to change their schedule. The mother is asking for a change, but the author is within their rights to stick to the existing arrangement. \n\nThen there's the emotional and practical side. The mother is in school, which might make her time more limited. However, the author's time is also significant, especially since they only see the child 8 days a month. The key here is that the mother is requesting a change, but the author isn't violating any agreement by declining. The court order is a legal agreement; without a court modification, the original terms stand. \n\nAlso, the author might be prioritizing their bonding time with the child, which is important for the child's well-being. The mother's request could be seen as reasonable, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong if they're following the court's decision. It's about balancing both parents' needs and the child's best interests. Since the court order already exists, the author isn't at fault unless they agreed to the change, which they haven't. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
