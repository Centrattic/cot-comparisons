I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the parent (author) has every weekend with their son, while the mother has him 22 days a month. The mother is now asking for every second weekend, citing that she's in school and needs more time with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that outlines their custody time. Any changes to custody arrangements typically require court approval. The mother's request to modify the schedule without going through the court might not be legally valid. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nNext, the emotional and relational angle. The author clearly values their time with the child and has a bond. The mother's reasoning is that she's struggling with school, but the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The author's reluctance to give up more time could be seen as prioritizing their bond with the child, which is reasonable. However, the mother's situation might be challenging, so there's a balance between their needs and the child's best interest.\n\nThe key points here are the existing court order, the significant disparity in custody time, and the mother's current circumstances. The author's stance is about maintaining their scheduled time, which is protected by the court. Unless there's a formal modification process, the author isn't violating any laws by refusing. Emotionally, it's understandable that the author doesn't want to lose time, especially since it's a smaller portion compared to the mother's.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be about the child's well-being. If the mother's increased time is necessary for her to manage school and care for the child properly, that could be a factor. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't violating any agreements. The mother would need to petition the court if she wants a change, not unilaterally alter the schedule.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
