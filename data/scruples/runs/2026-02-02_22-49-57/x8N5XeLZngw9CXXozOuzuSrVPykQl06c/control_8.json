I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The current arrangement is 8 days a month for the author and 22 for the other parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. There's a court order, so changing it would require legal action. The author isn't obligated to give up time unless there's a court modification. Legally, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally and practically, the author values the time with their son and has a fixed schedule. The other parent's request could be due to her current circumstances, but the existing order already gives her majority time. The author's refusal isn't selfish if the court order is in place. It's about maintaining a structured visitation. Unless there's a valid reason to adjust the order, the author isn't violating anything by not changing their time. So the answer is B.\n"
