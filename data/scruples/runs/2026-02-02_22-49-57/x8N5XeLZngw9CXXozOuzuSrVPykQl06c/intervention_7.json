I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule every weekend with his son after a separation. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resistant because he feels his time is already limited (8 days a month) and doesn't want to lose any.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to the visitation schedule would typically require legal approval. The father is right to be cautious about altering the agreement without going through the proper channels. The mother's request could be a negotiation tactic, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. \n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother might feel she's missing out, especially with school commitments. However, the father's feelings are valid too; he looks forward to the weekends and values the time. The key here is that the current arrangement is legally binding. The father isn't wrong for wanting to maintain his schedule, especially if the mother hasn't approached the court. \n\nPossible arguments against the father: maybe he's being inflexible, but given the legal framework, he's within his rights. The mother should use legal means to seek a modification if she's serious. The father isn't at fault for not negotiating outside the court order. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong). The existing court order is the main point here. The father isn't required to give up his time unless the court decides otherwise. The mother's request is a personal appeal, not a legal one, so the father isn't being an asshole by declining.\n"
