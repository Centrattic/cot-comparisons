I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant and wants to keep his scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so changing them without the court's approval isn't something either parent can do unilaterally. The mother's request would require a modification of the custody arrangement through the court, not just the father's agreement. So the father isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court changes the order.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother is a student, which might make it harder for her to find time, but the current schedule already has her with the child 22 days a month and the father 8 days. The father values his weekends highly since they're his time as per the court order. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by not wanting to give up any time.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong because the court order is in place. The mother should seek legal modifications if she needs changes. The father's stance is about maintaining the current arrangement as set by the court. Unless there's a violation of the order, he's not acting wrong. The answer would hinge on the legal framework of custody agreements and the necessity of court involvement in changes. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
