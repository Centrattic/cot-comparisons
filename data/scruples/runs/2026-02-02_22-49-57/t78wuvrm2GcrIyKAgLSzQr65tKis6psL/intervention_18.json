And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me start by going through the details again.\n\nThe friend had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Coworker B overheard her talking about it, then went to demand she not clip nails at work, calling it disgusting. The friend then clipped her nails in her cubicle, maybe to even them out. Then Coworker B texted her, upset because she could hear the nail clipping from far away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo the question is, is the friend the asshole (Answer A) or not (Answer B)?\n\nFirst, I should consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work is a common issue. Some people might find it gross because of noise or the visual, while others think it's a quick fix to avoid a longer break. The friend was in her cubicle, which gives some privacy. She had a valid reason (a hanging nail), but then clipped more to even them out, which might be seen as unnecessary. Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the noise and the act itself.\n\nWorkplace policies might matter here. If there's a rule against it, that's one thing. But if not, personal habits come into play. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. The key points are whether the action itself is inappropriate and how the friend responded.\n\nOn one hand, clipping nails in a private space might be acceptable, especially if done discreetly. On the other hand, the noise traveled, and someone else was bothered. The friend didn't consider that her coworker might find it offensive, even if she thought it was necessary. The act of clipping more nails after being told was a problem might show a lack of consideration.\n\nBut Coworker B's demand and the subsequent text could be overreacting. Maybe the friend wasn't in the wrong for taking care of a minor issue, but her follow-up action (clipping more) and the dismissive reply could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a balance between personal needs and workplace etiquette.\n\nIn some workplaces, people do quick personal grooming tasks in their cubicles. However, if it's causing a disturbance, it's a problem. The friend's actions, especially after being asked, might be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings. Even if clipping in a cubicle, the noise can carry, so maybe she should have avoided it to prevent bothering others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong because she continued the action after being asked and didn't take her coworker's discomfort seriously. Her response was dismissive. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
