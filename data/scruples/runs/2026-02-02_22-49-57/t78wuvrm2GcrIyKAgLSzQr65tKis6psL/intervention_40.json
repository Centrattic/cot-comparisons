And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario says that she had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Then Coworker B overheard her comment, confronted her, and later sent a message saying she could hear the nail clipping from far away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical workplace norms. Clipping nails isn't a common activity at work, but it's a personal hygiene task. If someone has a long nail that might affect their work or cause injury, trimming it makes sense. However, doing it in a shared space might be seen as disruptive or unprofessional depending on the workplace culture.\n\nThe friend had a valid reason to clip her nail, but then decided to clip two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be questionable. Clipping more than necessary could be seen as unnecessary and potentially disruptive, especially if it's audible to others. Coworker B found it gross and was disturbed by the sound. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive and not address the other person's discomfort.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. If clipping nails is not a regular or accepted practice in that office, then doing it might be seen as inappropriate. The fact that Coworker B was upset about the sound and the act in general suggests that the workplace culture doesn't tolerate such activities. The friend's initial action was maybe okay, but continuing to clip more nails after being told to stop could be seen as inconsiderate. The dismissive response might have escalated the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that it's a personal need and that Coworker B is being overly sensitive. However, in a shared workspace, respecting others' comfort is important. The key points are the reasonableness of the action, the workplace environment's tolerance, and the response to the coworker's feedback. The friend's actions after being asked to stop could tip the balance towards her being in the wrong.\n"
