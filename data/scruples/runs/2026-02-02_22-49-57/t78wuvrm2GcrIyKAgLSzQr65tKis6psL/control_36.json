And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers, which Coworker B overheard and got upset. Then the friend clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is generally considered unprofessional or disruptive because it can be noisy and messy. Many workplaces have policies against it. However, if the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe she thought it was private. But Coworker B heard her from 100 feet away, so it's possible the noise was disruptive.\n\nThe friend clipped more nails after being told not to. That could be seen as defiant. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tensions. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Some people might find nail clipping annoying, but others might not. It's subjective.\n\nBut the key points here are whether the action is against workplace norms and if the friend's response was appropriate. Clipping nails in the office is often frowned upon, even in a cubicle, because of the noise and mess. The friend didn't consider Coworker B's feelings after being told to stop, and then continued, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't take the feedback seriously and continued the action, leading to further complaints. Alternatively, if the company doesn't have a strict policy, it might not be wrong. But generally, office etiquette would suggest it's better to clip nails at home or in a private area to avoid disturbing others. So leaning towards A (author is in the wrong), but maybe B if the workplace is very lenient. However, the fact that she continued after being told and the response \"chill out\" might tip it towards A.\n"
