And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, which annoyed a coworker. The friend first mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers, then after being told not to do it, she did it anyway, even clipping two more. The coworker was clearly upset and said it was gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is the asshole. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people find it gross because of the noise or the debris. However, if there's no official workplace policy against it, maybe it's a personal choice. But the coworker was so upset that she confronted the friend and then sent a text. The friend then continued, which might be seen as dismissive or not respecting the coworker's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend could argue that it's a normal grooming task and that everyone has different hygiene practices. If the workspace is personal (like a cubicle), maybe clipping nails there is acceptable. But the fact that the coworker could hear from 100 feet away suggests it's noisy, which might be disruptive in a shared space. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as insensitive.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. Some might say it's a minor issue, others a breach of social norms in the workplace. But since the coworker was clearly offended and the friend didn't back down, maybe the friend is inconsiderate. However, the friend did clip to fix a problem and evened things out, which could be reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, the friend's actions after being told to stop might be inconsiderate. The key points are whether it's against company policy, the noise level, and the friend's respect for the coworker's feelings. Since there's no mention of policy, it's more about social norms. If the friend was in her own cubicle, maybe it's acceptable, but the response to the coworker might still be the issue. \n\nI'm leaning towards the friend not being in the wrong because there's no policy mentioned, but the response \"chill out\" might be the problem. However, the act itself might be seen as inappropriate. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, no, the author isn't in the wrong because there's no rule against it, even if some people find it gross. But others might see it as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
