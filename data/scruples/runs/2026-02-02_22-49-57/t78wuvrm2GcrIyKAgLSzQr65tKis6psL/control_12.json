And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B hears this, gets upset, and tells her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clips more nails, and Coworker B texts her again, upset because she could hear it from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the debate is whether clipping nails at work is gross or not. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unsanitary. Others might think it's a normal thing to do if you have a hangnail. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was private. But Coworker B was clearly bothered by it, even from a distance.\n\nIs there a company policy about this? The story doesn't mention any, so maybe it's a gray area. The friend did clip more than just the hanging nail, which could be seen as unnecessary after the complaint. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate things.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different sensitivities. What if the friend had a medical reason for the hangnail? Or maybe she just needed to do it quickly. But the act of clipping multiple nails after being told could be seen as defying the coworker's request, which isn't great. Also, the sound traveling 100 feet is a valid complaint if it's disturbing others.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It depends on the context. If there's no policy against it, maybe she's not wrong. But causing discomfort to others might make her at least partially responsible. The friend's actions after the initial complaint (clipping more and responding with \"chill out\") might be the main issue here. Maybe she should have been more considerate of others' feelings. So, leaning towards A, she's in the wrong. But maybe B, if it's a personal choice without a policy. Hmm.\n"
