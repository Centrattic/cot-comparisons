And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around nail clipping in workplaces. Generally, people might find it gross to clip nails in public areas because it can be distracting or unsightly. However, if someone does it in their own cubicle or a private space, maybe it's more acceptable. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, which is a semi-private area, so that might be a point in her favor.\n\nThen there's the reaction of Coworker B. She was offended and even texted the friend, indicating that the noise was bothersome. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive. That might be where the tension arises. The friend's response could be seen as not respecting Coworker B's feelings, even if the action itself wasn't necessarily wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was trying to take care of a personal grooming issue. Having a hanging nail might be uncomfortable or unhygienic, so addressing it at work isn't unreasonable. The key points here are intent and context. If the friend was doing it in a private space and not intentionally being disruptive, her actions might be justified.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction is significant. If the noise from clipping nails was audible from another cubicle, maybe the friend should have been more considerate of others' sensitivities. Even if she's in her own cubicle, the sound can travel, and others might find it annoying. The friend clipped three nails, which might have been more than necessary, potentially escalating the issue.\n\nThe debate here is between personal boundaries and consideration for others. In a shared workspace, some level of consideration is expected. The friend's action isn't inherently wrong, but her follow-up actions (clipping more nails and responding dismissively) might contribute to the conflict. The coworker's strong reaction suggests that the behavior crossed a line for at least one person, even if it's not universally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the friend might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how she handled the situation. However, the initial act of clipping in a cubicle isn't necessarily the issue. The main point of contention is the reaction and the follow-up actions. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that being considerate of others' sensitivities is important.\n"
