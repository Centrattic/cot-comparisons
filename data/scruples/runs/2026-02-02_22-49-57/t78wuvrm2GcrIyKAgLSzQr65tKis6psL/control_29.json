And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, confronted her, and then later texted that she could hear the clipping from far away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if clipping nails at work is generally considered inappropriate. It depends on the workplace culture. Some offices might frown upon it because the sound can be distracting or people find it gross. Others might not mind as long as it's done quietly or in private. The friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. However, Coworker B was clearly bothered by it, to the point of confronting her and sending a follow-up text. \n\nThe friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which might come off as rude. The act of clipping nails in the cubicle isn't inherently wrong, but if it's causing a disturbance, especially if the sound is heard from 100 feet away, that could be an issue. The friend might be in the wrong if she's ignoring a coworker's discomfort, especially after being directly told not to do it. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems extreme, but the friend's response wasn't helpful. \n\nSo, the question is whether the friend's actions were the problem. Since Coworker B felt it was disgusting and the friend continued after being asked, even if in her own space, it's possible the friend is in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's feelings. Alternatively, Coworker B might be overly sensitive. But the key point is that the friend's response was dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she continued the behavior after being told it was a problem, and her response was not respectful. Even if clipping nails isn't a big deal to her, the coworker's valid discomfort should be acknowledged.\n"
