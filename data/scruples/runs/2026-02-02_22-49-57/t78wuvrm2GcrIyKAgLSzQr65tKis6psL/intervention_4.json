And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. They mentioned it's a friend's story and there's a debate between coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then, after another coworker complained, she clipped more nails to even them out. The coworker B seemed really upset, even hearing her from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work a no-no? Some people might find it gross, others don't. It's subjective. But the main points are: the friend did it in her own cubicle, not in a shared space. She wasn't disturbing others directly, except maybe with the sound. Coworker B was the one who approached her and demanded she stop, then continued to be upset. The friend's actions were in response to the complaint, but then she clipped more. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could make others feel disrespected.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author here is the friend. So, if the workplace has specific policies against nail clipping, maybe. But if not, it's a matter of personal habits. However, considering that coworker B was disturbed by the sound, even from a distance, maybe the friend didn't consider the noise. But clipping nails in a personal space might be acceptable. The act itself isn't inherently wrong, but the response of \"chill out\" could be seen as rude. However, the main issue is whether the act of clipping is the asshole move. \n\nIn many workplaces, people do various personal things like applying makeup or using a phone, which others might find distracting. But if the friend's actions were in her own space and not affecting others except for the sound, maybe it's not her fault. However, she did continue after being asked to stop, which could be the problem. But she clipped a hanging nail first, which is necessary. The extra clipping might be seen as unnecessary, but again, subjective. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a grey area. Some might say she's in the wrong for not respecting coworker B's feelings, others might side with her. But since the coworker B was the one who approached and complained, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
