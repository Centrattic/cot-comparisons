And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail, then clipped it in her cubicle. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. The friend then clipped two more nails to \"even things out,\" and Coworker B heard her from far away and sent a text calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around office behavior. Clipping nails in the workplace is a common debate. Some people find it gross because of the noise and the mess, while others see it as a necessary personal grooming task. The key points here are the location and the reaction of Coworker B. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. Clipping one nail because it was hanging might be reasonable, but clipping two more to even them out could be seen as excessive or inconsiderate, especially if it's causing a disturbance.\n\nThe main issue seems to be the noise. Coworker B heard her from 100 feet away, which suggests the sound was noticeable. In an office environment, noise can be a problem if it disrupts others. Even if the friend is in her cubicle, the sound carrying over might bother others. The fact that Coworker B directly confronted her about it and then sent a text shows the level of her discomfort. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not considering the other person's feelings.\n\nHowever, the friend was within her rights to take care of personal hygiene during work hours. Nails can snag or cause discomfort, so clipping them is practical. The initial action might not be wrong, but maybe the follow-up (clipping two more) was unconsidered. The response to Coworker B's text was probably the biggest issue, as it lacked empathy and acknowledgment.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. While personal grooming is necessary, the way she handled it\u2014clipping more than needed and not addressing Coworker B's concerns respectfully\u2014could make her the asshole. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction might be overly sensitive. The answer might hinge on whether the action was disruptive and how the friend responded. Since the friend did clip in her cubicle and the noise was a problem, maybe it's a shared responsibility. But the question is about the friend specifically. If the answer is based on the actions taken, the friend might not be in the wrong for doing a necessary task, but the response to the complaint was poor. However, the initial act might not be the main issue. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because personal grooming is acceptable, but the follow-up actions might not matter in determining fault. Alternatively, if the noise and response are the key factors, maybe she is in the wrong. Hmm. I think the main point is that clipping nails in a private cubicle isn't inherently wrong, but the friend's response to the concern was dismissive. However, the initial act of clipping nails might not be the issue. So the answer could be B, but with the caveat that the response was poor. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the main action (clipping nails) isn't inherently wrong, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is B because the act itself isn't wrong, even if the response could have been better.\n"
