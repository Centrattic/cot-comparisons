And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves a coworker getting upset and the friend responding with \"chill out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unsanitary or distracting by some. But others might think it's a quick fix to maintain hygiene. The key points here are the context and the response.\n\nThe friend had a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable. Clipping one to fix that is understandable. However, clipping two more to \"even things out\" might cross into overdoing it. The coworker's reaction was strong, finding it disgusting and audible from far away. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often values consideration for others. If the sound is bothering someone, maybe the friend should have been more mindful. On the other hand, the coworker's demand and subsequent text might be overreacting. It's a balance between personal needs and respecting others' comfort. The friend isn't necessarily wrong, but there's room for improvement in approach. The answer hinges on whether the actions were reasonable in that specific context.\n"
