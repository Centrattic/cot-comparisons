And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more to even them out, and the coworker found it disgusting and confronted her. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider whether clipping nails at work is generally acceptable. In many workplaces, it's a personal choice. Some people might find it gross because they don't like the sound or the hygiene aspect. Others might not mind. It's subjective.\n\nThe friend's actions: She had a reason to clip a hanging nail, which is a practical need. Then she clipped two more to even them out. Maybe she wanted to maintain neatness. But the coworker took offense, possibly because of the sound or the act itself. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive, which could be seen as rude. However, the coworker's reaction was also strong\u2014demanding she not do it and then sending a text about hearing it from far away. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. If the friend was in her own cubicle and not disturbing others, maybe it's okay. But if the coworker is clearly bothered, maybe the friend should have been more considerate. However, the coworker's reaction seems extreme. \n\nIs there a policy about personal grooming at work? If there's no rule against clipping nails, then the friend isn't in the wrong. The coworker's discomfort doesn't necessarily make the friend the asshole unless the workplace has specific guidelines against it. The friend's response might have been a bit abrupt, but the main issue is the coworker's sensitivity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because personal grooming like clipping nails is generally acceptable unless prohibited by policy, and the coworker's reaction is more about personal preference than a valid workplace rule.\n"
