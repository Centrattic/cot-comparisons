And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend clipped a hanging nail and then two more, and a coworker got upset about it. The coworker found it disgusting and told her not to do it, then later the friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Generally, people have different opinions on what's acceptable in a workplace. Clipping nails can be a sensitive topic. Some might find the sound annoying or unhygienic, especially if others are close by. On the other hand, if someone has a long nail that's causing them discomfort, they might clip it in private.\n\nThe friend did clip her nails in her own cubicle, so she wasn't doing it in a public area where others would be directly affected. However, the sound carried over 100 feet, which is quite a distance. The coworker was clearly disturbed by the sound and the behavior. The friend then clipped two more nails after the initial one, which could be seen as unnecessary once the immediate problem was fixed. That might escalate the situation.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. It's important in workplace interactions to acknowledge others' feelings even if you disagree. The friend might not have considered the coworker's perspective and could have been more empathetic. However, the coworker's reaction seems overly harsh if the friend was in her own space and using a clipper properly.\n\nWorkplace rules vary, but there's no mention of a specific policy against nail clipping here. The main issue is the reaction from the coworker. If the friend's actions are within normal bounds and not disruptive, then the coworker might be overreacting. However, the friend could have been more considerate by waiting to clip nails during a break or in a private space like a restroom to avoid any potential disturbance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworker's reaction is strong, the friend's actions might be within acceptable limits. However, the friend could have handled the situation more sensitively. But since there's no rule against it and she's in her own cubicle, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. But the \"chill out\" response isn't helpful. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, but with some nuance.\n"
