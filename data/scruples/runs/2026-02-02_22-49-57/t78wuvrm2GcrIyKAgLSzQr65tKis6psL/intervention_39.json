And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is a bit of a debate between two coworkers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used her clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, then Coworker B overheard and confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider both sides. \n\nFrom Coworker B's perspective, clipping nails might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people find the sound annoying, and in an office setting, maintaining a certain level of cleanliness and respect for others' comfort could matter. Also, Coworker B felt disturbed enough to confront the friend and send a text about it, so there's a valid concern there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were in her own cubicle, which is a personal space. Handling a basic hygiene task like clipping nails isn't inherently wrong. She didn't force Coworker B to listen or be nearby. The act itself is common, and the noise might be unavoidable. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, but maybe she felt Coworker B was overreacting.\n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, employees should avoid activities that could be distracting or unhygienic in shared spaces. However, if the cubicle is a personal space and the action is quick and not repeated excessively, it's debatable. The key points here are the location (own cubicle), the frequency (clipping a few nails), and the response to Coworker B's complaint.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, she might have been considerate to Coworker B's feelings by perhaps doing it in a less audible way or in a private space. But since she was in her own cubicle, it's a gray area. Coworker B's reaction is also valid because personal space and noise sensitivity matter. \n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. But overall, the act of clipping nails in her own cubicle isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might not be the asshole here. So, the answer is B.\n"
