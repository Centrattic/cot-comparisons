And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is a bit of a social dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend clipped a hanging nail, which is understandable. But then she clipped more to even them out. Coworker B found it gross and complained, even hearing the clippers from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have been dismissive.\n\nNow, considering workplace norms. Nail clipping can be a personal hygiene issue. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or mess, especially in an office setting. However, it's also a basic grooming task that people might do in private. The key here is location. If the friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, it's more reasonable. But if it's in a common area, maybe not. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems over-the-top. Getting a text later about hearing the clippers from 100 feet away seems like a stretch. Maybe Coworker B is overly sensitive. The friend's initial remark about the hanging nail might have triggered B's reaction. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as not taking B's feelings into account, but maybe B was being too harsh.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually allows for some personal grooming as long as it's not disruptive. Clipping nails isn't as disruptive as, say, loud phone calls or strong perfumes. However, the sound might be annoying to some. If the friend did it in her cubicle, she's within her rights. But maybe she should have done it at a different time or place, like during lunch or in a restroom.\n\nThe debate is between personal needs and others' comfort. The friend's actions were for a legitimate reason (fixing a hanging nail), but the follow-up (clipping more to even out) might have been unnecessary. The response to Coworker B's complaint was dismissive, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn summary, while clipping nails in a semi-private cubicle isn't inherently wrong, the friend's actions and response might have contributed to the conflict. Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. The friend isn't entirely at fault, but could have handled it more sensitively. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
