And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend who clipped her nails at work) is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky because it's about personal habits versus workplace etiquette.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her talking about it and then confronted her, saying it's disgusting not to clip it. Then the friend actually clips not just the hanging nail but also two more, and Coworker B texts her from far away, saying she heard it and finds it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are: clipping nails in the workplace, the noise being disturbing, and the friend's reaction. \n\nClipping nails at work isn't illegal or against health codes, but it's often considered unhygienic or messy. The sound of nail clippers can be annoying, especially in an open office. But is it the friend's fault? She was in her own cubicle, so maybe she's not at fault for doing something in her personal space. However, the noise carried over to Coworker B, who was clearly upset. \n\nThe friend also clipped two more nails after fixing the initial issue, which might come off as defiant or dismissive of Coworker B's feelings. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as rude or not taking the coworker's discomfort seriously. \n\nBut then again, Coworker B's initial reaction was to demand she not clip her nails, which might be overreacting. It's possible that Coworker B is being overly sensitive or has a personal issue with the sound. The friend might have a valid reason to clip her nails, especially if it's for comfort or hygiene. \n\nWorkplace norms vary, but in most offices, clipping nails isn't encouraged because of the noise and mess. However, doing it in a private space (like a cubicle) might be more acceptable than in a shared area. The friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate if they disrupt others, but Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. \n\nThe key here is the balance between personal needs and respecting others' comfort. The friend might not be in the wrong if she's in her own space, but her response and the additional clipping might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. On the other hand, Coworker B's demand and the loud complaint might be over the top. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is the asshole, the answer would depend on whether her actions are unreasonably affecting others. Clipping nails in a cubicle is a common issue, and while the sound can be annoying, it's not typically seen as the employee's fault unless it's done in a shared space or multiple times a day. The friend's response of \"chill out\" is dismissive, which could be problematic, but the initial act isn't necessarily wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for argument.\n"
