And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail, used clippers, and then did two more to even them out. Coworker B was upset, called it disgusting, and told her not to do it. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically a standard, but it's also not unheard of. Some people might do it if they don't have time otherwise. However, there's a social aspect here. People often prefer not to be around someone clipping nails because of the noise and the visual, which some find unappealing. \n\nThe friend mentioned having a hanging nail, which is a practical reason. But then she clipped two more to even them out. That part might be seen as unnecessary if the initial clipping was just to fix a problem. The coworker was disturbed by the sound and the act, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, is the friend in the wrong? It's about social etiquette and respect for others' comfort. Even if clipping nails isn't against the rules, doing it in a way that disturbs others might be considered inconsiderate. The key points are: was the action necessary? Did it affect others negatively? How did the friend respond?\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" after being confronted could be seen as dismissive. That might escalate the situation. The coworker's reaction is about personal discomfort, which is valid. However, the friend's actions, especially clipping extra nails after the initial need, could be viewed as adding to the disturbance. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. If someone is doing something that could be distracting or unpleasant for others, even if not explicitly prohibited, it's better to do it in a private space or outside of work hours. The friend's decision to clip nails in her cubicle might be acceptable, but the follow-up of clipping more and the dismissive response might tip the balance towards her being the asshole.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she continued the action despite knowing it upset a coworker and responded in a way that showed she didn't take their feelings seriously. However, some might argue she's not in the wrong because the act itself isn't inherently bad. But given the coworker's clear discomfort and the friend's continued actions, it's more likely A.\n"
