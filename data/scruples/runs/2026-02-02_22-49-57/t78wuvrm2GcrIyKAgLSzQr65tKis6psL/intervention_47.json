And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping their nails at work and another coworker finding it disgusting. The question is whether the friend is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions having a hanging nail and clips it right there. Then, Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and demands she not do it. The friend then clips a couple more nails to even them out, which Coworker B hears from 100 feet away and texts her again. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? Well, nail clipping in public can be a social faux pas because the sound is often considered unpleasant. But the context matters. If it's a private space, maybe not. However, work environments can have different norms. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the noise traveled far enough for another coworker to hear and be bothered.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's actions might not be entirely unreasonable. People might clip nails at work if they don't have time to do it elsewhere. However, doing it in a way that's audible to others could be inconsiderate. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is addressing a personal hygiene issue. On the other, the noise and location might affect others. The key points are whether the action is unreasonable in the workplace and if the friend's response was appropriate. Since Coworker B was directly offended and the friend continued after being asked, it's possible the friend didn't consider the others' feelings enough. However, it's a minor issue and might not make the friend the asshole. The answer could lean towards B (No), but there's nuance. Maybe B, but with some consideration for workplace etiquette.\n"
