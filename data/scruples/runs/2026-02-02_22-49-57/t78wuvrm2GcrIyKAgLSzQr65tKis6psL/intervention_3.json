And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used her clippers to fix it. That seems reasonable, right? People might get a hangnail and need to clip it. But then, Coworker B overheard her mention it and confronted her, saying not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped two more nails to \"even things out.\" After that, Coworker B texts her again, upset because she could hear the clipping from far away and finds it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the debate is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. On one hand, Coworker B is very sensitive about this. She's not just annoyed but calls it \"disgusting\" and \"gross.\" Maybe the sound is distracting or she has some aversion to seeing people clip nails. On the other hand, the friend didn't do it in a shared space; she was in her cubicle. She did it because she needed to fix a hangnail, which is a practical necessity. Clipping a couple more to even them out could be seen as overcompensating, but maybe just trying to maintain neatness.\n\nThe key points here are workplace norms and respect for others' sensitivities. While the friend was in her own space, the act of clipping nails might be considered unprofessional or unhygienic by some. However, it's also a personal grooming task that people might do in private. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could add to the tension, but the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong.\n\nWorkplace policies vary. Some companies might have rules against nail clipping to prevent mess or health issues, but if there's no policy, it might be more of a personal preference issue. The friend isn't doing it in a common area, so it's less about affecting others directly. However, the sound travels, which Coworker B is bothered by. So there's a balance between personal needs and considering others' discomfort.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? It's not a clear-cut case. She's addressing a personal grooming issue, but she should consider the impact on her coworker. Maybe she could have done it during a break or in a more discreet manner. But since she was in her cubicle, it's a private space. The coworker's reaction seems extreme, but the friend's response was dismissive. The friend might not be the asshole, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the act itself isn't inherently wrong and the coworker's reaction is overly sensitive, maybe the answer is B.\n"
