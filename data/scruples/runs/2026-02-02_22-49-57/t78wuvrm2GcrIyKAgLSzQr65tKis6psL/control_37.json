And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, then approached to demand she not do it, calling it disgusting. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and was upset. The friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points are: clipping nails at work, the reaction from coworker B, and the friend's response. The debate is whether it's gross or acceptable.\n\nI should consider workplace norms. Clipping nails might be seen as unhygienic or unpleasant for others, especially if it's audible. However, it's a personal hygiene task that people do regularly. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a private space, but the sound traveled. The key here is the workplace environment. Some offices might have rules against certain personal tasks at work. Also, the friend took it further by clipping two more nails after fixing the one, which could be seen as unnecessary if the first was just to fix a problem. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, adding to the conflict.\n\nBut then again, clipping nails isn't inherently wrong. It's common to do so in private. The coworker's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's action of clipping multiple nails after being told might be the asshole move. It's possible that the friend didn't consider the coworker's sensitivity and continued, leading to escalation. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually advises being considerate of others' feelings. If someone is bothered by the noise or the act, it's better to avoid doing it in shared spaces. Since the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe it's reasonable, but the fact that it was heard and caused a reaction suggests that it's disruptive. Clipping more nails after being told might show a lack of consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, coworker B's reaction could be excessive. Not everyone finds it gross, and the friend's actions were in her own space. The initial clipping was to fix a problem. Clipping two more could be for aesthetics, which is personal choice.\n\nI think the line is crossed when the friend clipped the extra nails after Coworker B's objection, showing defiance. The \"chill out\" response is also dismissive. So the author's actions after the first clipping might be the issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for continuing and the dismissive reply. But maybe not entirely? It's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the company's policies and respect for others' comfort, the author might be at fault.\n"
