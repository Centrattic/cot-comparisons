And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about clipping nails at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears and gets upset, demanding she doesn't clip there. Then friend does it anyway, clips a couple more, and gets a text from coworker B about hearing it from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. So, what's the etiquette here? Clipping nails at work can be seen as unhygienic or gross to some people. But others might see it as a practical thing, especially if it's a quick fix. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe it's not a big deal. However, Coworker B was disturbed enough to confront her. \n\nIs it the friend's fault? Well, maybe she should have considered others' feelings. If someone is bothered by it, the friend could have done it in a different location, like a restroom. But if the office doesn't have restrooms or it's a small space, maybe it's unavoidable. Also, the friend clipped more nails after being told, which might be seen as defiance. The response \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, making things worse. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. Even if the act itself isn't illegal or against company policy, causing discomfort can be seen as rude. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction is quite strong, maybe even overreacting. The key points are: was the friend considerate enough? Did she take steps to minimize disturbance? The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the follow-up actions (clipping more and responding dismissively) might tip the balance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the workplace allows personal grooming, maybe not. But if it's bothering others, then perhaps she should adjust. Since the friend didn't comply with the request and escalated it, that might make her the asshole. But Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. The answer might hinge on whether there's a policy against it. If not, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the response to Coworker B's complaint could be problematic. Hmm.\n"
