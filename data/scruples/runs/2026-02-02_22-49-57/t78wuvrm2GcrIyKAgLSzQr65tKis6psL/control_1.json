And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who clipped their nails at work is in the wrong. The situation involves two coworkers: the author's friend and Coworker B.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard the comment, then approached and told her not to do it because it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and received a text from Coworker B saying she could hear the clippers from far away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider workplace norms and social etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be considered unhygienic or disruptive. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unclean. However, it's also a personal grooming activity. The key points are: was the action disruptive, and was the friend's response appropriate?\n\nCoworker B was clearly bothered, to the point of confronting the friend and sending a text. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. But does that make the friend the asshole? It depends on whether the action itself is unprofessional or violates workplace policies. If there's no policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. But if it's a shared office space and the action is causing discomfort to others, maybe there's a case for considering the friend's actions inconsiderate. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a matter of personal choice versus others' sensitivities. \n\nIn some workplaces, nail clipping is discouraged because of hygiene and noise. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no explicit rule against it, but Coworker B's reaction is also valid from a personal preference standpoint. The debate is between personal freedom and others' comfort. Since the friend responded dismissively, that could be seen as a point against her. But the initial action might not be inherently wrong. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if there's no policy against it, but some might argue A because it's disruptive. However, since the friend was in her cubicle, the disruption might be minimal. The key is whether the action itself is against workplace rules. Since the scenario doesn't mention a policy, it's more about social norms. In that case, it's a grey area, but the friend isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
