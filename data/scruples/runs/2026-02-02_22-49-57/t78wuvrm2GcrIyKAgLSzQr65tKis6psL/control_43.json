And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation is that their friend did it, but the coworker got upset. The user wants to know if the friend is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't something people usually do in shared spaces. It's generally considered unhygienic or unprofessional because it involves bodily fluids and might be seen as gross. The coworker's reaction was strong, saying it was disgusting and even hearing it from 100 feet away. That's a lot of noise and possible disruption.\n\nThe friend clipped three nails after the first one. The coworker B specifically told her not to, so the friend continued after that. The response \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive, which could add to the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize it was a big deal. Some people might clip nails if they don't have time to go home, but it's still not common. Workplace etiquette usually expects you to do personal grooming at home or in private areas. Since the friend was in her own cubicle, maybe she thought it was okay, but the sound and the act itself could still be an issue for others.\n\nSo, considering common workplace standards, even if it's done in a private space, doing something that's considered gross and disruptive might not be appropriate. The coworker had a valid concern about hygiene and noise, and the friend's response didn't address that. Therefore, the friend might be the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
