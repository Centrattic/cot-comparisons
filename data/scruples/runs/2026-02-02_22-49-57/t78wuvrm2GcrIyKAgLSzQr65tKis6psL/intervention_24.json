And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail, clipped it, then clipped a couple more to make them even. Coworker B overheard her talking about it, got upset, told her not to do it, and then later sent a text saying she could hear it from far away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of. People might do it if they're busy or don't have time to do it before work. But there's a social norm aspect here. Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant, even if it's not harmful. The act itself isn't unhygienic unless the person isn't clean, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She went over to demand she stop, then later texted about being disturbed. The friend then clipped more nails, possibly in response, and replied with a dismissive comment. The friend's actions might be seen as dismissive of Coworker B's feelings, which could be considered rude. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, not in a common area. So maybe she had the right to do it there.\n\nIs it an asshole move? Well, the friend probably didn't intend to bother anyone. But she continued after being asked, which might be seen as not respecting Coworker B's request. However, Coworker B's reaction could be over the top. It's a balance between personal habits and office etiquette. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best approach, but it's a reaction to being criticized.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong because clipping nails isn't a serious issue, but she could have been more considerate. Alternatively, Coworker B might be overly sensitive. But the question is about the friend being the asshole. The friend's actions were in her own space, but she continued after being told to stop, which could be seen as dismissive. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the friend's actions were reasonable, then B (No). Considering workplace norms, clipping nails isn't a big deal, but continuing after being asked might be. However, Coworker B's initial demand was abrupt. Hmm.\n"
