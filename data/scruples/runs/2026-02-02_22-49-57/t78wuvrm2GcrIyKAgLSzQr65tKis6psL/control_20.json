And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped two more nails, and Coworker B heard from far away, leading to more complaints. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" Now, is the friend wrong?\n\nI should consider workplace norms and etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess, while others think it's a personal choice. The key factors here are the location and the reaction of others.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle. If the cubicle is private and the noise wasn't disturbing others, maybe it's okay. But if the sound carried 100 feet, that's a problem. The friend's action might be causing a disturbance, even if done in her own space. Also, after being told not to do it, she continued, which could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. People might have different sensitivities. Maybe the friend didn't realize the sound was so loud. But since the coworker specifically called it disgusting and the friend kept doing it after being asked, that's probably overstepping. The friend might be in the wrong because she continued despite knowing it was bothering someone else. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor thing and the coworker is being overly sensitive. But the fact that the sound was audible from far away and the friend kept doing it even after being asked suggests it's a breach of workplace courtesy. So, the answer might be A (the friend is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the workplace has specific rules against nail clipping, but that's not mentioned here. The main issue is the disturbance and the friend's response. So, leaning towards A.\n"
