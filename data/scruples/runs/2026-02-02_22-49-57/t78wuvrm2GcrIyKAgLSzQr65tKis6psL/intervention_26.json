And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The situation involves some social norms and workplace etiquette.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. That seems reasonable. But Coworker B overheard the comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from afar and sent a text calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work wrong? Well, in many workplaces, personal grooming is allowed, but there are usually unspoken rules. Clipping nails might not be common, but it's not illegal. However, doing it in a way that's disruptive or offends others could be an issue. The friend did it in her cubicle, so it's a private space. But the sound carried, which Coworker B found bothersome.\n\nThe key points are: the friend was in her own cubicle, which is semi-private, and she was addressing a personal hygiene issue. However, the act of clipping nails can be distracting or unpleasant for others, especially if done frequently or loudly. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could come off as rude.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not clip their nails and then being annoyed by the sound is a bit contradictory. The friend was in her right to take care of her nails, especially if it's a quick fix. However, doing it in a way that's considerate of others' feelings is important. Maybe clipping during a break or in a less audible area would be better. But in this case, the friend was in her cubicle, which is her workspace.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves balancing personal needs with others' comfort. If the friend was doing it occasionally and in a private space, it's probably not an asshole move. Coworker B's sensitivity to the sound is a personal preference, but not everyone might share that. The friend's actions were her own, but her response could have been more diplomatic. However, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was handling her personal hygiene in her workspace and didn't intentionally cause disruption, I think she's not the asshole. Coworker B's reaction is more about personal discomfort than a valid workplace rule violation.\n"
