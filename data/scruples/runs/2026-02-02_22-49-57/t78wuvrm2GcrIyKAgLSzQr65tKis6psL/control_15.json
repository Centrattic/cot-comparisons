And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the scenario: the friend mentions she had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B heard from far away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points here. Clipping nails at work\u2014common practice or not? Some people might find the sound annoying, others not. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's reasonable. But Coworker B is clearly disturbed by it. The friend clipped two more nails after fixing the first one, which could be seen as unnecessary, maybe making a point or showing defiance. \n\nIs it gross? That's subjective. Some people don't like the sound or find it unhygienic. But others do it all the time. The key factors here: was the friend being considerate? She did it in her cubicle, not in a shared space, so maybe it's okay. However, after being told to stop, she continued, which could be seen as dismissive of coworker's feelings.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might come off as insensitive. Even if the friend doesn't think it's a big deal, responding that way to someone who's clearly upset could be rude. \n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It depends on company policies, but if there's no rule against it, maybe not. However, continuing after being asked might show lack of consideration. The friend's actions were in her space, but the sound travels, which is unavoidable. Coworker B's reaction is strong, but the friend's response was dismissive. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The friend might not be wrong for clipping nails in her own cubicle, but responding \"chill out\" after being told to stop might be the asshole part. Maybe the main issue is the response, not the action itself. But if the friend was aware of the coworker's discomfort and still did it, that's inconsiderate. Hmm. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she continued despite being told to stop and responded dismissively. Or B (No) because it's a personal choice in her own space. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because of the response and continuing after being asked. Even if it's allowed, the reaction could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
