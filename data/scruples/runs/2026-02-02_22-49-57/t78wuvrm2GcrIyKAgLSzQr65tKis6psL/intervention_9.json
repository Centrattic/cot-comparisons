And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend clipped a hanging nail at work. That seems reasonable because having a long, hanging nail can be uncomfortable or even painful. But when the coworker overheard and then confronted the friend, the friend clipped more nails to even them out. Then the coworker heard her from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether clipping nails at work is gross or inconsiderate. On one hand, clipping nails can create noise and maybe small particles that others might find annoying. Plus, some people might find the sound irritating. But on the other hand, it's a personal hygiene thing. If you have a long nail, it's not like you can just let it stay that way.\n\nThe coworker was pretty aggressive, demanding the friend not clip them. Maybe that coworker didn't consider that the friend had a valid reason. Also, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a private space? Cubicles aren't entirely private, but they do offer some separation. The friend didn't make a big show of it, just clipped in her own area.\n\nBut the friend did clip three nails after the initial one. Was that necessary? Maybe she wanted to even them out, but that's a personal choice. The response \"chill out\" might have been a bit dismissive, but if the coworker was overreacting, maybe it's justified.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? I don't think so. The coworker seems more sensitive about it. People have different sensitivities to sounds and such. The friend wasn't being inconsiderate; she was addressing a personal issue. The coworker's reaction was extreme. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
