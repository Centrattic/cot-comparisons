And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work was in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then, after a coworker complained, she clipped two more to even things out. The coworker was really upset, saying it was disgusting and heard from 100 feet away. The friend just said \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? Well, it's a common thing people do, but it might depend on the workplace culture. Some offices might find it okay, others not. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, so maybe it's a bit more acceptable there. However, the coworker was clearly disturbed by the noise and the act itself. The friend continued after the complaint, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe key points are: the action (clipping nails) vs. the context (workplace). Even if it's a normal activity, doing it in a shared space where others are working might be considered inconsiderate if it's bothering others. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as insensitive, not acknowledging the coworker's discomfort. \n\nBut some might argue that it's a minor thing and the coworker is overreacting. However, the friend did continue after being told it was bothersome. That escalation could make the friend the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, if the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, maybe it's not her fault. But the act of doing it after a complaint and in a way that's audible from a distance shows poor consideration. \n\nSo, weighing in, the friend might be in the wrong because she continued the activity after being told it was disturbing others. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the friend's actions post-complaint were dismissive. Therefore, answer A (yes, she's wrong).\n"
