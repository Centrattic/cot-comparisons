And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author, who is the friend in this story, is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail, which is probably uncomfortable or unsightly. She mentioned it to a coworker and used her clippers to fix it. Then another coworker, B, overhears her complaint and confronts her, telling her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clips not just the one nail but two more to \"even things out,\" and coworker B hears the clipping from 100 feet away, getting upset again. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo the main issue here is whether clipping nails at work is considered gross or inappropriate. Coworker B clearly thinks it's a problem, while the friend and possibly others might think it's okay since everyone has to take care of their personal grooming sometimes.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on the company's culture. In some jobs, personal grooming is considered a private matter and might be done during breaks or in restrooms. Clipping nails in a shared workspace could be seen as unhygienic or distracting, especially if the sound is audible to others. However, if there's no specific rule against it, it might be considered acceptable as a necessary personal task.\n\nThe friend's action of clipping one nail is understandable, but when she clipped two more to even them out, that might have been excessive. Coworker B was already bothered by the initial clipping, so continuing after that could be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive or rude, not taking coworker B's discomfort seriously.\n\nHowever, the coworker's reaction seems extreme. It's possible that coworker B is overly sensitive or has a personal issue with the sound of nail clippers. In many workplaces, people do minor grooming tasks like fixing hair or adjusting clothing in their cubicles without issue. The key factors here are the workplace's specific policies and the sensitivity of the coworkers involved.\n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether there's a rule against it and how reasonable the coworker's reaction is. Without a specific policy, the friend isn't necessarily wrong, but she could have been considerate by doing it in a more private area or using a nail clipper that's less noisy. However, the coworker's reaction might also be unreasonable. The friend's response was probably not the best, but the main issue is the act itself.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because there's no explicit rule against it, but there's a gray area. However, some might argue that she should have been more considerate, so there's a case for A. But based on typical workplace norms without specific rules, probably B is the answer.\n"
