And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author (my friend in the story) was in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The question is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) perspective. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, gets upset, and demands she stop. Then, the friend clips another two nails to even them out. Coworker B texts again, saying she could hear it from 100 feet away and finds it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm, there are a few angles here. Workplace etiquette is subjective, but there are general norms. Clipping nails at work might be considered unprofessional or distracting by some. However, the friend wasn't in a common area; she did it in her own cubicle. That might be a key point. People often do quick grooming tasks in their personal space if there's no better time, like trimming a snagged nail. \n\nBut then she did two more after the initial one. That's not just a quick fix. Maybe that's where the line is crossed. Coworker B felt it was gross and disturbing, especially from a distance. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive. \n\nI need to consider if there's a policy against it. The scenario doesn't mention any rules, so assuming it's a grey area. The friend's action in her cubicle might be her right, but doing multiple nails might be seen as taking up work time unnecessarily. Also, the noise could be a factor. If it's really loud and disturbing others, even from a distance, it might be an issue. \n\nSo, is it a reasonable action? Maybe, but the fact that she did three nails after being asked to stop could be the asshole part. The initial clipping was a necessity, but continuing after being told to stop might be inconsiderate. The response to the coworker also lacks empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might not find it that bad if done in a private space. But since it was audible and caused direct discomfort, balancing between the friend's needs and the coworker's sensitivities is important. The friend might not be the asshole, but maybe she should have considered a better time or place, and responded more politely. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if it's a clear A or B. The main points are: location (private cubicle), initial reason (hanging nail), and the follow-up actions. If there's no policy against it, the friend's actions are technically not against the rules. But the coworker's reaction is valid from a social standpoint. The friend's response exacerbates the issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because there's no explicit rule violation, and people sometimes need to take care of personal grooming. However, the act of clipping three nails after being asked to stop in a shared workspace might be inconsiderate. But since it's in her own cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. The \"chill out\" response is part of the problem, but the original action might not be. So overall, B.\n"
