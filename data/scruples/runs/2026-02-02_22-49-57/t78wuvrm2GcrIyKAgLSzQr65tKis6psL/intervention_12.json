And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says that the friend mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers, then Coworker B overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped three nails, and Coworker B got more upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people find it gross, especially if they can hear it from far away. But others might think it's a personal hygiene matter and acceptable if done discreetly.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which is probably about hygiene. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might be seen as unnecessary. The act of doing it in a cubicle could be considered private, but the noise travel distance suggests it wasn't really private. The response \"chill out\" might come across as dismissive.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some companies might have policies against certain activities. If Coworker B felt strongly enough to confront her, maybe the friend should have respected that. However, if the friend was in her own space and didn't mean to disturb others, maybe it's a matter of differing sensitivities.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the act was causing distress to a colleague and there were alternatives (like doing it at lunch or after work), then maybe she's at fault. But if the coworker is overly sensitive, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. The answer hinges on balancing personal needs against workplace harmony.\n"
