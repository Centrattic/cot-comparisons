And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping her nails at work. The main question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it because she had clippers. Then a coworker, B, overheard and told her not to clip there because it's disgusting. The friend clipped more nails to even them out, and coworker B heard from 100 feet away and complained again. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work an asshole move? Well, it's a matter of workplace etiquette. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the process. But others might see it as a minor, necessary task. The friend didn't do it in a public area; she was in her own cubicle. Clipping a hanging nail to prevent pain makes sense. However, clipping multiple nails after that could be seen as unnecessary and maybe a bit of a provocation, especially after being told not to. But coworker B's reaction seems over the top\u2014complaining about hearing it from far away and calling it disgusting. The friend's response was to tell B to chill out. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. If the company has specific policies against such things, that could matter. But assuming there's no policy, the friend isn't violating a rule. However, the social context is tricky. Even if not against the rules, causing discomfort to a coworker might be unwise. But Coworker B's initial reaction was confrontational without reason. The friend's actions were in her cubicle, which is a personal space. Clipping nails isn't harmful, just maybe unpleasant to some. The friend didn't force others to witness it. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
