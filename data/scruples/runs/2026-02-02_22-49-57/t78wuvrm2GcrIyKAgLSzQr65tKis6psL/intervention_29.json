And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (their friend) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The situation is that the friend clipped a hanging nail and then a couple more, leading to a coworker getting upset and sending a text. The user thinks the friend isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, consider the context. Clipping a single hanging nail might be seen as necessary for hygiene or comfort. But doing more than that could be seen as unnecessary in a work setting. The coworker was clearly upset, calling it disgusting and gross. The key points here are public vs. private behavior and workplace etiquette.\n\nWorkplaces often have unspoken rules about what's acceptable. Some people might find nail clipping distracting or unsanitary, especially if it's done frequently. The friend did this in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the noise traveled 100 feet. That's a lot of noise, so maybe the coworker felt it was inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a valid reason for the first clip. But then she clipped two more, which could be seen as overdoing it. The response of \"chill out\" might not be the best approach; maybe a more considerate response would have been to move to a private area or use a noise-dampening tool.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. While there's no outright rule against it, the reaction from the coworker suggests that the friend's actions were inconsiderate. The fact that she did it multiple times and in a way that was heard from afar could tip the balance. However, it's also possible that the coworker is overly sensitive. The friend's actions, while not illegal or unethical, might be seen as inconsiderate in a shared workspace. So, leaning towards yes, she's in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
