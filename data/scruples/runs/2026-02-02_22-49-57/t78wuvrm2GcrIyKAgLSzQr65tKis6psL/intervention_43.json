And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned a hanging nail and clipped it when a coworker overheard. Then the coworker got upset and told her not to do it, and the friend continued clipping more nails, leading to another complaint. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't a common practice, but it's not unheard of. Some people might find it gross because of the noise and the visual. The coworker was clearly disturbed, even to the point of hearing it from 100 feet away. That's a lot. So, the friend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was in her own cubicle. Maybe she thought it was private. But cubicles aren't entirely soundproof. The noise travels. Clipping nails can be loud and annoying, especially if others are trying to focus. The friend clipped three nails, which might seem excessive. The initial clip was to fix a problem, but then \"evening things out\" added to the issue.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" is dismissive. That could be seen as the friend not respecting the coworker's feelings. People have different sensitivities, and while clipping nails isn't illegal, it's a matter of workplace etiquette. The key points are the noise disturbance and the friend's response. Even though the friend was in her cubicle, the act of clipping might disturb others. The coworker's reaction is valid if it's affecting her work environment.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a judgment call. But from a workplace etiquette perspective, disturbing others with noise without regard for their comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's actions and the dismissive response might tip the balance towards her being the asshole. But some might argue it's a minor issue. However, the fact that the coworker was clearly upset and the friend continued, then responded dismissively, suggests that the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
