And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author, whose friend clipped their nails at work, is in the wrong. The situation is a bit of a toss-up. The friend mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers, which Coworker B found gross and forbade. The friend then clipped more nails and responded with \"chill out\" when confronted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails might be considered unhygienic or disruptive in some workplaces. The fact that Coworker B was offended and that the sound was audible from 100 feet away suggests it's disturbing to others. However, the friend was in her cubicle, so maybe it's a personal space issue. The key points are: was the action unprofessional or a disturbance? \n\nIf the workplace has a policy against such things, the friend might be wrong. But if there's no policy, it's more about personal preferences. The friend's response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could add to the conflict. But the act itself\u2014clipping nails\u2014might be seen as acceptable if done in a private space. However, if the sound was bothering others, it's a consideration for others. \n\nSo, the answer depends on context. Without a specific policy, it's subjective. But since Coworker B was so upset, maybe the friend was inconsiderate. However, it's a minor issue. The friend isn't doing something harmful, just a personal grooming task. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the nuance that it's a judgment call. But the question asks if the author is in the wrong. Given that the friend's actions led to a confrontation, maybe it's a yes. Wait, but the friend was in her cubicle, so maybe it's normal. I'm a bit split. The answer is B, no, because it's a personal choice unless there's a rule against it. The friend's actions weren't harmful beyond the noise, which could be mitigated by doing it in a private area. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
