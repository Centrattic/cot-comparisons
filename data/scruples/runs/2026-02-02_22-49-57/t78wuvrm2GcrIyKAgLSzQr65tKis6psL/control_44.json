And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail and clipped it, then clipped two more to even them out. A coworker overheard her and got upset, calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" The debate is whether this is an asshole move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it's generally not common. Some people might find the sound of nail clippers annoying, especially in open office environments where noise travels. The coworker B was 100 feet away and could still hear it, which suggests the noise was noticeable. That could be disruptive, even if unintentionally.\n\nThen there's the issue of public vs. private. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so technically she was in her space. But if the sound carries, maybe she should have done it in a break room or a less public area. However, if the workplace allows for some personal grooming, clipping nails might be acceptable as long as it's not disruptive. The friend's action of clipping three nails because one was hanging could be seen as necessary, but clipping others just to even them might be seen as optional and less urgent.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is also a factor. Demanding she not do it and then getting more upset later might come off as over-the-top, but the friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive. Workplace etiquette often values consideration for others, so maybe the friend should have taken the feedback into account and found a different time or place.\n\nOn the other hand, coworker B's initial demand and later message might be considered overly harsh. Maybe the friend isn't the asshole if she's just maintaining her nails and it's not causing significant disruption. But if the noise is bothering others, even if unintentionally, she might be inconsiderate.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The key points are whether the action is disruptive and how the friend responded. Since the friend did it in her cubicle but the sound traveled, maybe she could have been more considerate. However, coworker B's reaction was strong. Depending on company culture, this might vary. Overall, the friend might not be the asshole, but she could have handled it better by being more mindful of others' sensitivities. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but maybe A if the disruption was significant.\n"
