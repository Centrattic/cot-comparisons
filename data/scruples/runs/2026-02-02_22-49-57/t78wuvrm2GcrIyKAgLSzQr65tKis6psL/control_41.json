And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her mention it, then approached and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped the nail and two more, and Coworker B heard it from 100 feet away and texted her again. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the friend do something wrong? Is clipping nails at work considered inappropriate? It depends on workplace norms and company policies. Some people might find it gross because of the noise or visual, others don't. The fact that coworker B was upset enough to confront and text her suggests it's a sensitive issue in their workplace.\n\nBut the friend was in her own cubicle. If the workplace doesn't have rules against it, maybe it's not against the rules. However, even if it's allowed, some people might still be disturbed by it. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a practical reason (a hanging nail) and tried to fix it. Clipping two more to even things out might be overdoing it, but maybe just to keep it neat. The noise being heard from 100 feet away is possible if the clippers are noisy, which can be annoying in an office setting.\n\nSo, the debate is between personal hygiene needs vs. respecting others' sensitivities. If the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. But the response to Coworker B's concerns might have been too casual. However, the main question is whether the act itself is wrong. Since there's no policy mentioned, it's more of a judgment call based on social norms. Some might say it's a minor issue, others a bigger one. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) if there's no policy, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
