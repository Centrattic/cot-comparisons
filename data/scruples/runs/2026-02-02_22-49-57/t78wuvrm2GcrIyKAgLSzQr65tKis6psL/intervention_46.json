And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is a bit nuanced, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, from Coworker B's perspective, clipping nails can be seen as unsanitary or gross. People might make noise, and there's the aspect of nail clippings being visible. Some workplaces have rules against certain personal grooming activities to maintain a professional environment. Also, Coworker B was upset enough to confront the friend and later text her again, which shows a strong reaction. So, maybe Coworker B's feelings are valid to some extent.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was just dealing with a hanging nail, which could cause discomfort or even infection if not addressed. Clipping it in her own cubicle seems reasonable, as it's a private space. She did it to fix an actual problem and even mentioned doing it to \"even things out,\" which might be a bit defensive but not entirely unreasonable. Her response of \"chill out\" was probably meant to de-escalate the situation, though it might come off as dismissive.\n\nNow, considering workplace norms. In many offices, people do quick grooming tasks if they're in their own space. However, if it's disruptive or against company policy, that's different. The key here is whether the friend was in a common area or her own cubicle. Since she was in her cubicle, the action might be considered private. The fact that Coworker B heard her from over 100 feet away suggests that the noise was an issue, but that's more about sensitivity rather than actual noise violation.\n\nThe debate is whether it's acceptable. Some might find it gross, others not. The friend isn't doing it to annoy, just to fix a problem. However, the act itself, while practical, could be seen as unprofessional by some. But unless the workplace has a specific rule against it, it's hard to say she's at fault. The main issue is Coworker B's reaction being overly sensitive, but the friend's actions don't seem malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while Coworker B's feelings are valid, the friend isn't necessarily wrong unless the workplace has a strict policy against it. Since the scenario doesn't mention any such policy, the answer leans towards the friend not being in the wrong.\n"
