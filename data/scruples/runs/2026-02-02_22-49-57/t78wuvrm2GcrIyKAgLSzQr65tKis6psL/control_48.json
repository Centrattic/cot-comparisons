And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail, used her clippers in her cubicle, which Coworker B overheard and got upset about. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate in some workplaces. The noise could be disturbing to others, even if done in a private cubicle. Coworker B's reaction is strong, indicating that the sound was bothering her significantly. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive of Coworker B's feelings, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people need to take care of minor personal grooming issues during the workday. If the friend did it quickly in her own space without causing a disturbance beyond the noise, maybe it's understandable. However, the act of clipping nails can produce sounds that others find unpleasant, especially if heard over a distance. The friend's decision to clip more nails after the initial complaint could be seen as exacerbating the issue.\n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, loud noises like nail clipping might not be acceptable if they disturb others. The friend's response wasn't respectful of Coworker B's discomfort. Even if the friend felt it was necessary, the way she reacted might make her the asshole because she didn't consider the impact on her coworker.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the friend's actions, while perhaps minor, caused discomfort, and her response was dismissive. However, if the cubicle is considered a private space, maybe not. But the noise traveling over 100 feet suggests it's a shared workspace where sounds carry. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong for not being considerate of others' sensitivities.\n"
