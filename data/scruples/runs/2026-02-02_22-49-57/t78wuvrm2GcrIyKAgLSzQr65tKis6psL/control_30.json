And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and mentioned it to a coworker. Then Coworker B overheard and demanded she not do it. The friend clipped her nail, then two more to \"even things out,\" and Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nI need to consider workplace norms and etiquette. Clipping nails at work can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive, depending on the environment. Some offices might find it gross because of the noise or the mess, while others might not mind. The key points here are the reaction of the coworker and the friend's response.\n\nCoworker B was clearly upset, to the point of confronting and then texting again. The friend's \"chill out\" seems dismissive. Even if clipping nails isn't explicitly against the rules, the fact that it disturbed a coworker could be a problem. The friend might not be the asshole if it's a minor action, but the escalation and dismissive response might tip the scales. Also, doing it in a cubicle might be more private, but the noise still traveled. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. If the action negatively affects others, it's on the person doing it to either adjust or be prepared to face feedback. The friend's response wasn't very considerate, so maybe she is in the wrong. But maybe Coworker B overreacted. However, the question is whether the friend is the asshole. The answer might lean towards A (yes) because she continued despite the complaint, leading to more conflict.\n"
