And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B heard and complained, then later the friend clipped more nails to even them out. Coworker B was clearly upset and called it disgusting. The friend responded \"chill out.\" \n\nSo, the main points to consider are office etiquette and respecting coworkers' feelings. Clipping nails can be a bit of a personal hygiene issue. In many workplaces, people might consider it unhygienic or distracting because the noise can bother others. The friend clipped in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but the noise carried 100 feet. That's pretty far, so even if it's her space, the noise affects others. \n\nAlso, the friend did it after Coworker B already complained once. She clipped more nails to \"even things out,\" which might have been a reaction to the initial complaint, but doing more after being told to stop could be seen as not respecting the coworker's boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, clipping nails isn't inherently wrong. People might do it at work if they don't have time at home. However, the noise and the reaction from Coworker B suggest it's a sensitive issue. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the workplace has policies against such things, then yes. But if there are no policies, it's more about common courtesy. Since the coworker was clearly disturbed and the friend continued after the complaint, it's a matter of balancing personal needs with others' comfort. The friend might not be the asshole, but she could have handled it better, like doing it in a bathroom or outside. Since the answer is A or B, and the options are whether she's in the wrong, I think A is more likely. But maybe B because it's a common thing people do, though the response to the complaint matters. Hmm.\n"
