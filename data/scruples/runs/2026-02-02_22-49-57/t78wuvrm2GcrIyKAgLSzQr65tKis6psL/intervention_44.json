And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even things out. Coworker B was upset because they heard her from 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm, first, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? Well, I mean, people do personal things at work sometimes. Like, maybe you can't avoid it if you have a hangnail. But then, doing it in the cubicle, especially when someone is upset about the noise. Nail clippers can be loud, so maybe that's the issue. Coworker B might have been disturbed by the noise. The friend did it in her own space, but if it's loud enough to be heard across the office, maybe that's a problem.\n\nBut on the other hand, the friend did clip a real hangnail first, which is probably necessary for hygiene or comfort. Then doing two more to even them out\u2014maybe that's reasonable. But Coworker B took it as gross, so it's a matter of perception. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. Maybe she should have apologized or done it in a different area, like a break room.\n\nBut is the friend in the wrong? Or is Coworker B overly sensitive? If the workplace doesn't have specific rules against it, maybe the friend isn't wrong. But if the noise is bothering others, maybe she should have been considerate and done it elsewhere. The initial act might be okay, but the response and the continued clipping could have been handled better. So the friend might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe she could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the friend did it in her cubicle and the coworker was overreacting, maybe the friend isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
