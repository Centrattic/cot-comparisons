And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story is that she mentioned she had a hanging nail and had clippers, then Coworker B overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend clipped her nail, then two more to even things out. Coworker B was really upset about the noise and called it gross. The friend said \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the friend is the asshole here. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms and what's considered acceptable. Clipping nails at work is a common issue. Some people find it gross because of the noise or the mess, others think it's fine if done in a private space and quickly. The friend was in her own cubicle, which is semi-private. But Coworker B overheard the initial comment and then confronted her. Then the friend did it, causing a disturbance. \n\nIs it unprofessional? Maybe. Some workplaces have rules about such things. If the friend had done it in a restroom or a break room, maybe it's less of an issue, but in her own cubicle where others can hear? The noise might be a problem, especially if Coworker B was disturbed. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a necessary nail to avoid a health issue (a hanging nail) could be a valid reason. It's a quick task, and if done discreetly, maybe acceptable. The friend was just trying to fix her own issue. But the fact that Coworker B was so bothered and that the friend did three nails after being told not to might make it seem like she's being defiant.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The friend might not be in the wrong if it's a quick, necessary action done in a private space. However, the response to Coworker B's concern with \"chill out\" could come off as rude. The key points are the workplace culture and whether such actions are prohibited. If the workplace has no specific rules, then the friend might be in the right, but if it's a shared space where noise is an issue, then maybe she's not. But the user's friend didn't do it in a public area, just her cubicle. So I'd lean towards B, not in the wrong, but it's a bit close. The main issue is the response to Coworker B, but the action itself might be acceptable.\n"
