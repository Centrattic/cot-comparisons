And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) subreddit post, so the goal is to determine if the friend did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker (B) finds nail clipping disgusting and confronts the friend, later sending a text about hearing it from far away. The friend then clips more nails, responding with \"chill out.\" \n\nCommon workplace norms: People might have different sensitivities. Some might find nail clipping gross, others don't. But is it a standard policy to prohibit it? Not sure. Most workplaces don't have rules against it unless there's a specific hygiene issue. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a private space. However, the sound can carry, especially in open offices.\n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped one nail when a part was hanging, which could be reasonable. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" The coworker was clearly disturbed, so the friend might not have considered that her actions were bothering others. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nIs clipping nails inherently wrong? It's a personal hygiene task. At home, it's normal, but in the workplace, especially if it affects others, it's debatable. If the office has no policy, maybe the friend isn't at fault. But she didn't consider her coworker's discomfort, so maybe she should have been more mindful. \n\nThe coworker's reaction: She found it disgusting and confronted the friend. Her reaction is strong, but if it's a one-time thing, maybe it's over the top. However, if the noise is persistent and disturbing, that's another angle. \n\nSo, the friend might not be in the wrong if it's a personal choice without a policy against it, but her response could have been better. However, the key is whether the action itself is wrong. If the workplace allows it and she's in her cubicle, maybe not. But if the sound is bothering others, maybe she should avoid it. The answer hinges on workplace norms and sensitivity. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, and the friend did clip in her own space, perhaps the answer is B (No). But the response \"chill out\" might be an issue. However, the main question is about the act itself, not the response. So, considering all, the friend isn't necessarily wrong unless there's a specific rule against it. So answer B.\n"
