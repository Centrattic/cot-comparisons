And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned having a nail clippers, which led to a coworker getting upset and telling her not to do it. The friend then clipped her nails, and the coworker was annoyed again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette and what's considered acceptable. Clipping nails at work is a common issue. Some people find it gross, others don't mind. The key points here are the reaction from the coworker and the friend's actions.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle. So she wasn't doing it in a shared space. That might be a point in her favor. However, the coworker was very vocal about it being disgusting and could hear it from a distance. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might be seen as dismissive.\n\nBut is it really the friend's fault? If the workplace doesn't have a specific rule against it, then maybe it's a matter of personal preference. However, if the action is causing discomfort to others, even if it's not a rule, it's considerate to avoid it. On the other hand, the coworker's reaction seems extreme. Maybe the friend was being reasonable by doing it in her cubicle, but the coworker's sensitivity is the issue here.\n\nI need to balance both sides. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no policy against it and she's doing it in her own space. But if it's causing a disturbance, then maybe she should be more considerate. However, the coworker's demand and the subsequent text came off as overreactive. The friend's response was flippant, but maybe that's just how she handles conflict.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, if the company has no rules, the friend isn't necessarily in the wrong. The coworker's reaction is more about personal discomfort than a legitimate policy issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No). But I should check if there's any other angle. For example, maybe the noise is a problem, but that's part of office life. People might have different sensitivities. The friend's action is common, so the coworker's response is the issue. Hence, the friend isn't in the wrong.\n"
