And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Coworker B overheard the comment and then went to tell her not to do it because it's gross. Then the friend clipped two more nails to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from far away and sent a text calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. The main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Coworker B finds it gross and disturbing. Maybe the sound is annoying, or there's a concern about hygiene or mess. If someone is clipping nails in a shared space, there could be issues like small bits flying around, or maybe the sound is distracting. But the friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe the mess isn't a problem. The sound is the main issue here, as Coworker B could hear it from far away. Some people might find the sound unpleasant or distracting, similar to how some people can't stand the sound of chewing or tapping.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a hanging nail seems like a practical thing to do. People might clip nails in private areas like restrooms or break rooms, but doing it at your desk? Maybe it's not the best place, but if she's in her own cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. The friend only did it after Coworker B told her not to, so maybe she felt defensive. Clipping two more nails could be seen as provocation, but maybe she wanted to even her nails. The response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate things.\n\nI think whether it's an asshole move depends on the workplace culture. If there's no specific rule against it, it's probably not a major issue. But if the sound is really bothering someone, maybe the friend should consider doing it during a break or in a private area. However, Coworker B's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially after the initial confrontation. The friend did it in her cubicle, which might be considered her personal space. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best approach, but the act of clipping nails itself isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because it's a minor thing and not a major violation. But some might argue that the friend was inconsiderate by doing it after the coworker asked her not to. But since she did it in her own cubicle and the coworker is being overly sensitive, maybe the friend isn't the asshole.\n"
