Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, which another coworker found gross and complained about. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, nail clipping in general. Some people might consider it unsanitary or unsuitable for an office setting. But others might think it's a normal thing to do if done discreetly. The key here is the context. The friend had a hanging nail and wanted to fix it, which makes sense. She clipped it in her own cubicle, which seems reasonable because it's her space. However, she then clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as unnecessary. The coworker heard the clippers from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. That's a strong reaction. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive.\n\nNow, considering office etiquette. Offices often have unwritten rules about personal grooming. While some people might do quick fixes like adjusting hair or applying lip balm at their desks, nail clipping can be more noticeable and might bother others. The act of clipping in a shared workspace could be disruptive, even if done in one's own cubicle. The sound of clippers can travel, and the coworker was clearly disturbed by it. The friend's action of clipping three nails might have been over the line, especially after the initial complaint.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the coworker's reaction. The coworker approached her cubicle and demanded she stop, then sent a text later. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might not be the best way to handle a complaint. Maybe a more polite acknowledgment would have been better. However, the initial act of clipping nails in her own space isn't inherently wrong unless the workplace has a specific policy against it. The friend had a valid reason (a hanging nail) but extended it to three nails, which could be seen as unnecessary. However, the coworker's strong reaction might be overkill too.\n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, it's a bit of a grey area. The friend didn't do anything that's universally wrong, but there's a social consideration here. If the workplace norms consider nail clipping in office inappropriate, then the friend might be in the wrong. But if there are no strict rules and the friend did it discreetly, maybe not. The fact that the coworker heard it from so far away suggests it was loud, which could be disruptive. The friend's response was snippy, which isn't great, but the core issue is whether the act itself is inappropriate.\n\nOverall, I think the friend isn't entirely in the wrong because there's no explicit rule against it, but she could have considered the coworker's feelings more by doing it outside the office or in a more private area. The coworker's reaction was perhaps overly harsh, but the friend's actions did cause discomfort. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the friend not being the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
