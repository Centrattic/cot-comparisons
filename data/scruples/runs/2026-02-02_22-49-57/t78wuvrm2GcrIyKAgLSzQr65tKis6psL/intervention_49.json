And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions having a hanging nail and using clippers. Coworker B overhears this, then confronts her, telling her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clips her nails in her cubicle, maybe to even them out. Coworker B hears it from afar and sends a text calling it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Some people might find it gross, especially if they can hear it. But is it really a big deal? Let's think about workplace norms. In some places, people do minor grooming tasks like this during breaks. But if it's causing a disturbance or making others uncomfortable, that's a problem. \n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe it's not a public area. But the sound travels, as Coworker B points out. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. However, the initial act of clipping a hanging nail could be seen as necessary. The friend then clipped more nails, which might have been to fix an imbalance, but that's a bit odd. \n\nIs it about personal grooming vs. workplace etiquette? If the company has a policy against such things, that's one thing. But if there's no rule, it's more about personal preferences. The coworker is being very sensitive to the sound and the act itself. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the action is within acceptable workplace behavior and the friend is doing it in her own space without violating any rules, then maybe not. But the fact that it's causing a disturbance and the friend's response is flippant might tip the scales. But if there's no policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. It's a judgment call. The coworker's reaction is strong, but does that make the friend the asshole? Maybe not. It's a common annoyance for some people, but unless there's a rule, it's a matter of differing sensitivities. So probably answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
