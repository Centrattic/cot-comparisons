And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves coworker B getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, confronted her, and then later complained about hearing the nail clippers from far away. The friend clipped two more nails after the first one, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nNow, I need to consider workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because of the noise or the process, especially in an open office. But others might see it as a quick, necessary task. The key points here are that the friend did it in her own cubicle, not publicly, and only after coworker B had already confronted her. However, clipping two more nails after the initial complaint could be seen as provocative, even if she felt defensive.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She demanded the friend stop, and later texted her about it being disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could be a point against the friend. \n\nBut is it the friend's fault for doing something she considers normal? Maybe the workplace has a policy against certain behaviors, but there's no mention of that here. The friend acted in self-defense after the initial confrontation but might have overstepped by doing more clipping. However, the main issue is whether it's reasonable to clip nails at work, which is a common debate. \n\nConsidering these factors, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's doing a personal task, but her actions after the confrontation might have been unwise. However, the question is about being the \"asshole,\" which typically involves a breach of social norms. Clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but doing it after being told not to could be seen as disrespectful. However, since coworker B was the one who first raised the issue, the friend's response might be justified. \n\nIn the end, it's more about differing perceptions. The friend might not be the asshole, but her actions could have been handled better. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the act itself isn't objectively wrong, even if the coworker was uncomfortable.\n"
