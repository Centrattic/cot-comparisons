And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and clipped it, then did two more to even them out. Coworker B got upset because they heard the clipping from over 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette and what's generally acceptable. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it can be a sensitive issue. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unhygienic. However, doing it in a private or semi-private space like a cubicle isn't necessarily wrong unless it's a shared space or common area. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend was in her own cubicle, which is a personal space, so clipping nails there isn't necessarily violating any rules. However, the coworker B was disturbed by the sound and the act, which led to the friend clipping three nails in response. The friend then dismissed the coworker's concern with \"chill out,\" which might not be the best response but doesn't necessarily make her the asshole.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some places might have policies against such things, but unless there's a specific rule, it's hard to say. The friend's actions were in her cubicle, so maybe she's not in the wrong. On the other hand, if the sound was disruptive, even from a distance, that could be a point against her. But clipping a few nails quickly probably isn't a major disruption. The coworker's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's response was dismissive. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and insensitivity. The friend didn't ask to clip in a public area, but doing it in her cubicle is reasonable. The coworker's reaction is strong, but the friend's actions weren't malicious. So, the friend might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
