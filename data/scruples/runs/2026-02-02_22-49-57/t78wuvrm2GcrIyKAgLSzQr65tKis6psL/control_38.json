And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a nail because it was hanging and then did two more to even them out. Then coworker B got upset and said it was disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Nail clipping can be seen as unhygienic or distracting in some workplaces. However, it's also a common task people do at home. But doing it in the office might be a different story. \n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. Maybe that's acceptable. But the sound travels 100 feet, so Coworker B heard it. That could be annoying, especially if the workplace is quiet. If someone is doing something that causes noise complaints, even in their own space, it might be an issue.\n\nThe friend's response was \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive. That might have worsened the situation. Coworker B's reaction is based on perception of grossness and noise disturbance. The friend's actions, while not illegal, might be considered unprofessional or inconsiderate in a shared workspace.\n\nBut is it really the friend's fault? It depends on company policies. If there's no rule against it, maybe Coworker B is being overly sensitive. However, if the action is causing a disturbance, the friend might need to adjust even if it's not strictly against the rules.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether clipping nails in the office is considered disruptive. Since Coworker B was disturbed, and the friend continued, it's possible the friend was inconsiderate. However, it's a minor issue. Maybe not a major asshole move, but there's room for improvement. The friend could have done it during a break or in a more private area. The key is balancing personal needs with workplace decorum.\n"
