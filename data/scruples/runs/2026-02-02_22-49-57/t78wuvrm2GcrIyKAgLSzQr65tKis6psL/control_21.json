And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation where they clipped their nails at work. The story says that the friend clipped a hanging nail and then a coworker overheard and got upset, calling it disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails and told the coworker to \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether clipping nails at work is wrong. Some people might find the sound annoying, like if you're in a quiet office, the clippity-clip could be distracting. But others might think it's a quick fix for a personal grooming issue and not a big deal. The coworker was really bothered by it, though, which is a problem. \n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she was trying to be discreet. But Coworker B heard it from over 100 feet away, which is quite a distance. That suggests the sound carries a lot. Maybe the friend didn't realize how loud it was. Then again, clipping one nail might be okay, but doing three might be seen as excessive, especially after the initial complaint. \n\nThe friend's response was \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive or not taking the coworker's feelings into account. That might escalate the situation. But maybe the friend felt that the coworker was being overly sensitive. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, personal grooming should probably be done outside of work hours or in a private area where it doesn't affect others. Clipping nails can create noise and possibly mess, which some people find unpleasant. On the other hand, if the friend was doing it quickly in her own space, maybe Coworker B was being too sensitive. \n\nBut the key points are that Coworker B was clearly disturbed by it, and the friend continued after being asked not to. The friend's actions after the first complaint (clipping two more) might be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. Also, the \"chill out\" response wasn't very considerate. So maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. \n\nHowever, sometimes coworkers can be overly sensitive, and if the friend was being considerate but the coworker is just being difficult, then maybe the friend isn't the asshole. But given that the friend did clip the nails in response to a hanging one and then did two more, maybe it's a bit much. The sound traveling so far does add to the issue. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong because they didn't consider the coworker's discomfort and continued the action after being asked to stop. So Answer A.\n"
