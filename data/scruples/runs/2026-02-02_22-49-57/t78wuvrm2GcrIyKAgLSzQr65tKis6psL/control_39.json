And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: She mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and later texts her again about it being disgusting. The friend then clips more nails after the initial one, which coworker B hears from far away.\n\nSo, the main issues here are workplace etiquette and personal boundaries. Clipping nails at work isn't inherently wrong, but it can be a matter of sensitivity to others. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is her space. However, doing it after being told to stop by a coworker might be problematic. The fact that she clipped two more after the first incident could be seen as disregarding coworker B's feelings, even if she was just trying to even her nails.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. Demanding someone not to clip nails because they find it gross might be overreacting. It's a personal preference, but telling someone they can't do something in their own space could be considered overstepping.\n\nThe friend responded with \"chill out,\" which is dismissive. That might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily the end of the world. The key points are: Was it wrong to clip nails in the first place? Probably not, especially in a private cubicle. However, continuing after being told it upsets someone else might be inconsiderate. The friend could have chosen to clip them elsewhere or at a different time. But coworker B's reaction was also harsh and maybe unprofessional.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? Maybe not entirely. It's a mix of both sides. The author is in her cubicle, which is her space, but the noise and her continued action after being told might be inconsiderate. However, Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. The answer might depend on the workplace culture. If it's a place where such personal actions are generally accepted, the friend isn't wrong. But if the company has rules against it, then she might be. Since the scenario doesn't mention any company policies, it's hard to say. But given the information, the friend's actions aren't necessarily wrong, but she could have been more considerate. Coworker B overreacted. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
