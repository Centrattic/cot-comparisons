And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentions having a hanging nail and uses clippers. Then another coworker overhears and demands she stop because it's disgusting. The friend proceeds to clip more nails and then gets a text from the coworker about hearing it from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess, others don't see it as a big deal. The key points here are the context and the reactions.\n\nThe friend was in her own cubicle, so she's not in a shared space. She clipped the nail to fix a problem (hanging nail), which is a reasonable action. However, the coworker found it so offensive that she demanded she stop. The friend continued and even clipped more, which might have been a response to the criticism. Then she told the coworker to \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of perspective. While the coworker is sensitive to the noise, the friend was in her own space. Clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but if it's causing disturbance, maybe she should avoid it. However, the coworker's reaction seems extreme, especially since it's a common activity that some people do in public places. The friend's response was probably trying to be light-hearted, but maybe it wasn't the best approach. However, the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong.\n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong here. It's more about differing opinions. The friend isn't necessarily in the wrong for doing something many people do. The coworker B might be overreacting. So, answer B (No) because the author isn't the asshole.\n"
