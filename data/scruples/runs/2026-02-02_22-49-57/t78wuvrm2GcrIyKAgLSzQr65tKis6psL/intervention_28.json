And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then two more, leading to a coworker getting upset and texting her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the workplace norms. Nail clipping can be a topic of debate. Some people might find it gross because of hygiene concerns or noise. Others might see it as a quick personal task that doesn't affect others. The key here is whether the action was disruptive or unhygienic.\n\nThe coworker B was upset enough to confront the friend and later text her about the noise being disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive. But was the friend actually at fault? If she was in her own cubicle and didn't spread debris or make excessive noise that disturbed others, maybe not. However, the act itself might be considered unprofessional by some standards.\n\nAlso, the friend clipped three nails, not just the one that was hanging. That might amplify the issue if coworkers found it more bothersome. But the initial reason was a hanging nail, which is a practical problem. The friend's actions might be justified as a quick fix, but the response of coworker B is also valid if the workplace has unspoken rules against such activities.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. If the office is quiet and people are working, even normal sounds like nail clipping could be distracting. But if it's a standard office with some ambient noise, maybe it's acceptable. The distance mentioned (100 feet) suggests that the noise was audible, which might be a point against the friend.\n\nHowever, the friend didn't invite others to watch her clip nails, just did it in her cubicle. The coworker overheard and then confronted her, which is a social judgment call. The friend's response was flippant, which could have escalated the situation. But the core issue is whether the act itself is wrong.\n\nConsidering all factors, it's a nuanced situation. The friend's action might not be inherently wrong, but the way she handled the coworker's reaction could be improved. However, the question is whether the author (friend) is in the wrong for clipping the nails. If the workplace doesn't have a rule against it, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the action is unhygienic or disruptive, then it might be considered inconsiderate. Given that the friend was in her own space and the main issue is the coworker's sensitivity, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
