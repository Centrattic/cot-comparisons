And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, and then another coworker, B, overheard. Coworker B demanded she not do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail in her cubicle, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from her cubicle and sent a text calling it disgusting. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Different people might have different views on this. Some might find it gross because they associate nail clipping with home activities, or they might be disturbed by the sound. Others might think it's a personal hygiene issue and acceptable as long as it's done discreetly.\n\nThe friend did clip her nails in her cubicle, which is a private space, but the sound carried. The act of clipping in the workplace could be seen as a disruption if others are bothered by it. However, the friend didn't do it in common areas; she did it in her own space. But Coworker B was clearly upset, both in person and via text. \n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive. That could contribute to the perception that she's not considering others' feelings. But maybe she felt her rights to personal space and hygiene were being overstepped. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some companies might have policies about such things. If there's no policy against it, then it's more about social norms and mutual respect. The key points are: was it done in a private area, and did it affect others? \n\nClipping in the cubicle is private, but the sound traveling to another cubicle might be an issue. If Coworker B is sensitive to sounds, that's their personal preference. But should the friend be required to avoid it if it's not a health or safety hazard? \n\nOn the other hand, the friend clipped her nails after being told it was disgusting. Then she clipped two more, which could be seen as overreacting. Maybe she felt she had to, but that might make the situation worse. \n\nThe debate is between personal hygiene/dignity and others' discomfort. In most workplaces, unless it's a violation of policies, it's a matter of respect and common courtesy. If the friend did it discreetly in her own space, she's probably in the clear. But the act of clipping nails can be seen as unhygienic by some, so that's a factor. \n\nThe \"chill out\" response might not have been the best, but it's not necessarily wrong. The main question is whether the act itself is wrong. If there's no rule against it, then the friend isn't in the wrong. However, if the workplace has a culture where such things are considered inappropriate, even without a written policy, she might be. \n\nIn most cases, unless it's disrupting work (like the sound being distracting), it's probably not the friend's fault. But if Coworker B is particularly sensitive, that's her issue. The friend might need to be more considerate, but clipping nails in her own cubicle isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because it's a subjective issue. However, since there's no policy mentioned, and she did it in her own space, it's more about personal preference. Therefore, B.\n"
