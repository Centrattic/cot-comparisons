And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend clipped a nail because it was hanging, then clipped two more to even them out. Another coworker overheard and got upset, saying it was disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have escalated the situation.\n\nNow, considering office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't a common practice, but it's not unheard of. The main issue here is the noise and the reaction of the coworker. If the sound was disturbing, especially from 100 feet away, that's unusual. Maybe the clippers are loud, or the friend was doing it repeatedly. The coworker's strong reaction suggests that the noise was a problem. \n\nHowever, the friend was in their own cubicle. If they were doing it at their desk without bothering others directly, maybe it's a personal choice. But since the sound carried, it's possible others found it disruptive. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might not help the situation. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some people might find nail clipping gross or unhygienic if not done properly. But others might not mind. The key factors here are whether the action was disruptive and if there were any specific workplace rules against it. If there's no policy, it's more about sensitivity to others.\n\nThe friend clipped three nails. One was a hanging nail, which is a practical fix. The other two were to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as unnecessary. The coworker's reaction was strong, so the friend's actions might have crossed into being considerate enough.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? Well, they did take the action that disturbed a coworker, even if unintentionally. The response was defensive. On the other hand, Coworker B was confrontational and then continued to text about it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend might have been inconsiderate by clipping nails in a shared workspace where the noise was problematic. But Coworker B's reaction was also extreme. However, the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. Since the friend's actions caused discomfort, maybe they should have been more mindful. Also, doing it in their cubicle might be acceptable, but if the sound travels, maybe they should find a quieter place or a time when others aren't nearby. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because their actions, while understandable, caused distress to a coworker, and the response wasn't respectful. But some might argue B because it's a personal choice and not a major issue. However, given the strong reaction and the workplace context, A might be the correct answer here.\n"
