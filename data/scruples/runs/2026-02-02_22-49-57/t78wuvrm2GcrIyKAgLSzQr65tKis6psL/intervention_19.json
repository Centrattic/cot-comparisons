And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Then a coworker overheard her talking about it and confronted her, calling it disgusting. The friend clipped a couple more nails to even them out, and then the coworker texted her that she could hear it from far away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the friend was in the wrong. They think she's not, but they want my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The coworker found the nail clipping gross and was upset enough to confront her. But the act of clipping nails in a private cubicle\u2014assuming it's a typical office setup where cubicles are semi-private\u2014might not be unreasonable. People often do personal things in their cubicles, like eating or taking calls.\n\nHowever, the act of clipping nails can be loud (the sound of clippers) and might be distracting to others, even if done in a private space. If the coworker was disturbed by the noise, that's a valid concern. Also, the friend clipped more than just the hanging nail, which could be seen as overdoing it, thus adding to the annoyance.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was addressing a hygiene issue (a hanging nail can be uncomfortable and might lead to infection if not clipped). The response of the coworker seems overly harsh, especially if the friend was in her own cubicle. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive, which could escalate tensions.\n\nBut the key points here are: 1) Is it reasonable to clip nails in the office? 2) Did the friend overstep by clipping multiple nails after just one was hanging? 3) Is the coworker's reaction justified?\n\nIn many workplaces, there's an unspoken understanding that personal grooming should be done discreetly. Clipping nails in a cubicle might be acceptable, but the noise could still be an issue. The fact that the coworker was disturbed from over 100 feet away suggests that the sound was noticeable. Clipping multiple nails after the initial one could be seen as unnecessary, thus making the situation worse.\n\nHowever, the coworker's approach\u2014demanding she not do it and sending a text later\u2014might be overly confrontational. The friend's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful either.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some fault. The coworker could have addressed it more calmly, while the friend might have considered the noise level and clipped nails during a less busy time or outside the office. But the question is whether the friend is in the wrong. Since the friend used her own space to address a personal hygiene issue, and the coworker's reaction seems extreme, the friend might not be entirely at fault. However, clipping multiple nails after the first could be seen as provocative. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer leans towards B (No), but there's nuance. The friend isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives.\n"
