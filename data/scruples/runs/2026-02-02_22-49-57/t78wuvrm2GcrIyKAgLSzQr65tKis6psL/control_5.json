And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves a coworker getting upset and calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails in public spaces can be a sensitive topic. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the sight. Others might think it's a personal hygiene task that's necessary, especially if someone has a long nail that's causing discomfort.\n\nThe friend clipped one nail after a coworker overheard her mention having a hanging nail. Then she clipped two more to even them out. The coworker was upset about the noise and perceived it as gross. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have come off as dismissive.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often values considerate behavior. If someone is doing something that might disturb others, like loud noises, it's usually best to do it in a private setting. However, the friend was in her own cubicle. The noise might have carried, especially if the workspace is open-plan. The coworker's reaction might be about the sound being annoying, even if it's not visibly unhygienic.\n\nOn the other hand, having a hanging nail could be uncomfortable or unhygienic, so trimming it is understandable. The friend's action wasn't harmful, but the context of doing it in a shared space matters. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the friend's response might have been the issue. Instead of clashing, maybe the friend should have moved to a more private area or used a clipper with less noise.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a grey area. The act of clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but the context and the response to the coworker's discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction is valid from their perspective, but the friend's actions were for personal hygiene. However, the friend's \"chill out\" response might have escalated the situation. Maybe the friend should have been more considerate of the noise and privacy. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because the friend's actions, while personal hygiene, might have been inconsiderate in a shared workspace, leading to discomfort for others.\n"
