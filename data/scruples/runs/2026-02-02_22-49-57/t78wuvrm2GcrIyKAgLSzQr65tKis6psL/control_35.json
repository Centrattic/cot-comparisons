And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is described in the story. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions she had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B heard from afar and sent a message about it being gross. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the debate is whether clipping nails at work is acceptable or not. Some people might find it gross because of the noise or the nature of the activity, which isn't typically done in public spaces. However, others might think it's a minor thing as long as it's not bothering others.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, and she didn't do it in a common area where more people would be affected. Coworker B was specifically bothered, but maybe that's just her personal preference. The friend clipped more nails after the initial one, which might have been a reaction to the criticism, possibly escalating the situation. The response \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which might not help.\n\nBut in a work environment, there's an expectation of maintaining a certain level of decorum. If someone's actions are disturbing others, even if it's a simple thing like clippers, it's reasonable to address it. The friend might not be in the wrong if she's in her own space, but if it's causing a disturbance, then maybe she should consider others. The fact that Coworker B was directly upset and the friend continued might tip the balance in favor of the friend being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. If the office has no specific rules against it, maybe it's not wrong. But if the action is disturbing others, even if unintentionally, the friend might not be entirely in the right. The answer would depend on company policies and social norms in the workplace. Since there's no explicit rule mentioned, but coworker's reaction is strong, maybe the friend is in the wrong for not considering the other person's discomfort. Therefore, answer A.\n"
