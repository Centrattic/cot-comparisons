And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a conflict with Coworker B, who found the act disgusting and confronted her. The friend then clipped more nails and received a text from Coworker B criticizing the noise and the act itself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms and etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't typically a common practice, but it's not unheard of. Some people might do it quickly if they have a snag or a sharp edge. However, doing it in front of others or in a shared space could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's noisy or makes others uncomfortable.\n\nCoworker B's strong reaction suggests that the act was disruptive. The fact that the noise was heard from 100 feet away implies it was loud, which might be a problem in an office environment where noise levels are generally low. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which might escalate the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a legitimate reason to clip a hanging nail, which could pose a risk of snagging or causing injury. The act itself isn't harmful to others, but the context and how it was handled matter. Clipping three nails might be excessive if only one was problematic, which could be seen as unnecessary and thus more disruptive.\n\nWorkplace policies vary, so if there are rules against such activities in shared spaces, the friend might be violating them. However, if there's no specific policy, it's more about personal comfort and office culture. The key here is whether the action was reasonable under the circumstances. Clipping a nail to avoid injury is understandable, but doing it in a way that's audible and offends others might cross a line.\n\nThe friend's initial action might be acceptable, but the follow-up of clipping two more without a clear reason could be problematic. The response to Coworker B's message with \"chill out\" shows a lack of consideration for their feelings, which could be seen as the friend being inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, while the initial act might not be the end of the world, the subsequent actions and the dismissive response contribute to the conflict. The balance tips towards the friend being inconsiderate, hence in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
