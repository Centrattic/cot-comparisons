Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping her nails at work. The coworker (B) overheard a comment about a hanging nail and got upset, demanding that the friend not clip her nails at work, calling it disgusting. The friend did clip one nail to fix the hangnail, then clipped two more to even them out. Then coworker B heard the clippers from far away and texted that it was gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, clipping nails in a workplace might be seen as unhygienic or unprofessional by some. The coworker's reaction is strong, finding it disgusting and gross. Workplace etiquette often considers certain personal grooming activities as inappropriate, especially if others find them disturbing. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, not in a common area, which might mitigate the issue. The act of clipping a hangnail could be seen as necessary for health reasons, but the noise and visibility might be a problem if others are disturbed.\n\nOn the other hand, coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding that someone not clip their nails because it's \"disgusting\" might be a case of personal preference being enforced as a rule. The friend's action was to fix a hangnail, which isn't inherently wrong. The response of \"chill out\" suggests that the friend didn't think she was doing anything wrong. The key points here are the context of where it happened (private cubicle vs. public area), the reason (health vs. personal grooming), and the sensitivity of coworkers.\n\nWorkplace norms can vary, but generally, if an activity is done discreetly and doesn't interfere with others, it's acceptable. However, if it's causing a disturbance, even if minor, it might be considered unprofessional. The friend clipped nails in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but the noise carried. That might be an issue. However, hangnails can be painful and require prompt attention. The act of clipping two more nails to even them out could be seen as unnecessary, but if the first clip was to fix a problem, the others might be part of regular maintenance.\n\nThe coworker's reaction seems hypersensitive, but the friend's actions might also be seen as inconsiderate if done in a way that disrupts others. The friend's response of \"chill out\" wasn't helpful, as it dismissed the coworker's feelings without addressing the issue. Maybe a better approach would be to acknowledge the concern and find a solution, like doing it in another location or at a different time. But was the act itself wrong? It depends on the workplace's specific policies and culture. Since there's no mention of a policy against it, the friend might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that Coworker B was visibly upset and the friend continued might tip it towards the friend being inconsiderate, even if not outright wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the friend acted in a semi-private space for a reasonable reason, but the situation is nuanced. However, some might argue that the noise and coworker's discomfort make her actions inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the action is reasonable given the context. Since the friend didn't do it in a common area and the coworker's reaction is extreme, I lean towards B.\n"
