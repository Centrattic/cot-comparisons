And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend did it because she had a hanging nail and wanted to fix it. Then a coworker overheard her and got upset, saying it was disgusting and told her not to do it. The friend then clipped a couple more nails, and the coworker was still mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because the sound or the mess could be unpleasant. But others might think it's a normal thing to do, especially if you're in a private space like your cubicle. The question is whether the action is unprofessional or disruptive.\n\nThe friend didn't do it in a public area; she was in her own cubicle. That might matter. But the coworker could still hear her from 100 feet away, which suggests the sound is noticeable. Maybe the noise is the issue here. Some workplaces have rules about certain activities to maintain a pleasant environment for everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a valid reason to clip a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable or unsanitary if left. Clipping a couple more might be to even them out, which is reasonable. But doing it after being asked not to could be the problem. The coworker B told her not to do it, so maybe the friend continued despite that, which could be seen as dismissive of her colleague's feelings.\n\nHowever, coworker B's reaction seems strong. Calling it \"disgusting\" and being upset about hearing it from a distance might be overreacting. But if the workplace has a policy against such things, then the friend might be violating it. The key points are: location (private cubicle vs. public space), noise disturbance, and respecting others' discomfort.\n\nIn many workplaces, there's an unspoken rule to avoid activities that could disturb others, even if they're not explicitly forbidden. So clipping nails might be within personal space but still cause a disturbance. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle the situation, as it could come off as dismissive. Maybe she should have apologized or found a solution like stepping outside or using a private restroom.\n\nBut the coworker B's initial reaction of confronting her and then persisting in being upset might also be excessive. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the friend continued after being asked and the action is causing discomfort to a coworker, it's possible she's at least partially at fault. The question is whether it's the friend's fault or both parties are at fault. Since the user is asking if the author (the friend) is the asshole, considering the context, the answer could be A (yes) because she continued the action despite the coworker's objection. But if the coworker is being overly sensitive, then maybe B (no). \n\nI think the main issue here is that the friend didn't consider the coworker's discomfort after being directly told. Even in a cubicle, if others are getting disturbed, it's better to avoid it. So the answer might lean towards A.\n"
