And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her comment, then another coworker (B) confronts her, saying it's disgusting and demands she not do it. The friend then clips more nails, and Coworker B texts her again, upset about the noise and calls it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend is the asshole here. The debate is whether clipping nails at work is gross or okay.\n\nI need to consider workplace norms. In many offices, grooming is a personal choice, but there are usually unspoken rules. Clipping nails during work hours might be considered unprofessional by some. However, doing it in your own cubicle could be seen as reasonable if it's quick and not disruptive. The key points here are the reaction of Coworker B and the friend's response.\n\nCoworker B found it so objectionable that she confronted the friend and then sent a text. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. But the friend might argue she was within her rights.\n\nAnother angle: the noise being heard from 100 feet away. That seems excessive. If the clippers are loud, maybe it's a problem. But if it's a normal sound, then it's not. The friend clipped three nails, which is quick. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often suggests that personal grooming should be done in private and not disruptive. If the friend was in her cubicle and not affecting others, maybe it's okay. But if the noise is bothering someone, even if done in a private space, there's a social consideration.\n\nAlso, the initial comment about the hanging nail to a coworker might have triggered Coworker B. The friend's action was in response to a minor issue (a hanging nail), which is a common problem. \n\nThe main conflict is between personal grooming and office etiquette. The friend's actions were in her cubicle, so maybe not the wrong. However, the response of \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle it. But the question is about whether she was in the wrong for clipping the nails. \n\nIn many workplaces, it's acceptable as long as it's not done in common areas or during meetings. Since she did it in her cubicle, it's likely okay. Coworker B's reaction is more about personal disgust, but that doesn't necessarily make the friend wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The friend clipped three nails after the first one, which could be seen as unnecessary once she already fixed the initial issue. That might make her actions more about defiance or not taking Coworker B's concern seriously. However, the act itself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B. The friend isn't wrong for clipping her nails in her cubicle, but her response could be seen as dismissive. The act itself isn't the asshole move, but the reaction to Coworker B's confrontation might be. But the main question is about the clipping, not the response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
