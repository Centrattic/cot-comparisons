And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves Coworker B getting upset and confronting her, leading to a debate. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically considered a major issue. People might do it if they don't have time at home or if a nail is causing discomfort. However, it's understandable that some people find the sound or act unhygienic or disruptive. The key points here are the context and the reaction.\n\nThe friend had a hanging nail, so clipping it could be seen as necessary. She did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. The initial remark to a coworker was casual. When Coworker B overheard and confronted her, the friend clipped a few more nails to \"even things out,\" then continued after receiving a text from Coworker B. The response \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, but the main issue is the act itself.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on company culture. If it's a quiet environment, the sound might be more noticeable. However, unless there's a specific policy against it, it's hard to say it's wrong. The friend didn't do it in a public area where others would be disturbed, but Coworker B still heard from 100 feet away, which is quite sensitive. \n\nThe debate here is between personal convenience and others' sensitivities. The friend isn't violating any rules, but she's causing discomfort to a coworker. However, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. The friend's actions were reasonable given the need to fix a problem, and the location (cubicle) minimizes disruption. The main issue is the friend's response to Coworker B, but the initial act isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
