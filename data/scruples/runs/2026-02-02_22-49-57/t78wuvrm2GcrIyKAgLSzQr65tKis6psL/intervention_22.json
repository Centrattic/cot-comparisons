And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is about a friend clipping her nails at work, and Coworker B is upset about it. The user wants to know if the friend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails in the workplace isn't something I've seen as a common practice. It's usually done at home or in a private setting. But the friend only did it because there was a hanging nail, which might be uncomfortable. However, after that, she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nCoworker B overheard the comment, then confronted the friend, and later sent a text about hearing the clipping from 100 feet away. That seems like an overreaction. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which isn't the best approach either. \n\nNow, considering office etiquette, most workplaces have quiet areas or private spaces. Clipping nails can be noisy and might disturb others, but it's a short task. However, if someone is doing it in their own cubicle and not intentionally making noise, is that really a problem? It's possible that Coworker B is overly sensitive or has issues with personal space and noise. But on the other hand, the friend did it in her own cubicle, maybe without realizing the noise level.\n\nThe debate here is between hygiene/personal care versus workplace disturbances. Clipping a hanging nail is a health issue, but doing extra might be seen as unnecessary. The friend didn't hide it, but Coworker B's reaction is extreme. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend was in her own cubicle, did it for a good reason (hanging nail), and Coworker B's reaction was harsh. The friend's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful, but the main issue is whether the action itself was wrong. Since it's a private space and a personal hygiene task, the friend isn't entirely at fault. Coworker B's overreaction might be more the problem here. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe if the workplace has specific rules against it, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So sticking with B.\n"
