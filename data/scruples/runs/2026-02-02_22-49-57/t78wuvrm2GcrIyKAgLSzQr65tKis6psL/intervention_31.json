And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. The friend initially had a hanging nail and used clippers. Then someone overheard her comment and confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clipped a couple more nails, and the coworker got even more upset. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, the act of clipping nails in the workplace. It's a common thing people do, but it's often considered unhygienic or messy, especially in shared spaces. The coworker's reaction is strong\u2014they found it disgusting and even heard her from 100 feet away. That's a bit extreme, but maybe in an open office setting, noise could travel. \n\nThe friend's actions: she did it to fix a problem (hanging nail) and then continued to clip more to even them out. That part might be seen as defiant or a bit of a prank. The initial act might be understandable, but continuing after being told to stop could be seen as dismissive. However, the coworker's demand was quite strong, and the friend's response was to \"chill out,\" which might be perceived as not taking the concern seriously.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually involves being considerate of others. If clipping nails causes discomfort or distraction, even if it's a minor thing, it's better to do it outside the office. The friend might not be in the wrong if she's doing it in her own space, but the aftermath of continuing after being told not to could tip the balance. The coworker's reaction is also over-the-top, but the friend's persistence might contribute to the problem. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the location (her cubicle), the noise, and the response to the coworker's complaint.\n"
