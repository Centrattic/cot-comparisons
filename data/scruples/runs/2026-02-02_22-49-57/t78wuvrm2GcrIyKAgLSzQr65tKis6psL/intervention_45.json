And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her talking about it and then got upset, telling her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from the coworker saying she could hear it from 100 feet away and called it gross. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails in public or workspaces can be a point of contention. Some people might find the sound unpleasant or distracting, while others might think it's a practical thing to do if they need to. The key points here are the reaction of Coworker B and the friend's actions.\n\nCoworker B seems to have a strong negative reaction, even going as far as confronting the friend and later sending a text. The friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which might come off as rude. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, which could be considered a private space. But if the noise is carrying across the office, that might infringe on others' comfort.\n\nIs there a company policy about such things? The scenario doesn't mention that, so we can't assume there is any. However, general etiquette in shared workspaces usually involves being considerate of others. If the act of clipping nails is causing disturbance, the person doing it might be inconsiderate. But if it's a quick, necessary action done in a private area, it might be acceptable.\n\nThe friend's action of clipping more nails to \"even things out\" after being told to stop could be seen as provocative or showing disregard for Coworker B's feelings. That might tip the balance towards the friend being in the wrong, as she escalated the situation. But Coworker B's reaction is also quite intense, possibly overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the friend's actions are gross or not. The friend's side is that it's a minor, necessary action done in her own space. Coworker B's side is that it's gross and disruptive. Without a company policy, it's a judgment call on social norms.\n\nIn many workplaces, it's common to avoid eating strong-smelling foods or loud noises that disturb others. Clipping nails might fall into the same category if it's causing a disturbance. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive and not empathetic. However, the friend wasn't doing it in a shared space, just her cubicle. The sound carrying 100 feet might be an issue if the office is very open, but if it's a normal office layout, maybe not.\n\nConsidering all that, the friend might not be in the wrong if the action is necessary and done in her own space. However, the escalation by clipping more after being told to stop might be problematic. But Coworker B's reaction is also quite strong. It's a bit of a grey area. The friend's actions are not inherently wrong, but the response after being confronted could be considered inconsiderate. However, the main question is about being in the wrong for clipping, not the response. So the answer might hinge on whether the act itself is acceptable.\n"
