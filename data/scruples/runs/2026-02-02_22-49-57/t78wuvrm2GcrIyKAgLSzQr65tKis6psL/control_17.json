And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail, then did two more to even them out, and the coworker got upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross, especially if it's done in a shared space. But others might think it's a normal personal grooming task. The key points are the location and the reaction.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is private space. Coworker B walked over to demand she stop, which seems a bit over the top. But then the friend continued clipping and even did more nails, which could be seen as defiant. \n\nThe friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could have escalated the situation. The coworker was clearly bothered by the sound and the act itself. \n\nBut maybe the friend didn't do anything wrong. Everyone has different standards, and if it's in a private cubicle, maybe it's okay. However, if the noise was disturbing others, even from a distance, that could be an issue. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually allows for basic personal care, but if it's disruptive or unhygienic, it might not be. Since the friend was using clippers and doing it in her cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. But the coworker's strong reaction suggests it's a sensitive issue. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author (the friend) not being in the wrong because it's a personal choice in her own space. But then again, if others are disturbed, maybe she should consider their feelings. The answer might depend on company policies or general social norms. Since the question is about being an asshole, if the friend didn't mean to disturb and just did it in her cubicle, maybe she's not the asshole. But the act of clipping nails might be seen as unhygienic regardless. \n\nHmm. I think it's a judgment call. The friend didn't do anything illegal, but if the coworker is uncomfortable, maybe the friend should avoid it. However, since it's in her cubicle and not a shared space, it's more about personal boundaries. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a private action, even if some find it gross.\n"
