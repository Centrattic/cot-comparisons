And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped more nails, and coworker B heard from far away and sent a text calling it disgusting. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe core issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Let's consider office etiquette. Generally, there are unwritten rules about personal grooming at work. Some people might find nail clipping disruptive or unhygienic, especially if it's audible. However, others might see it as a quick fix for a minor issue, especially if done quietly and not in someone's presence.\n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be where the problem escalates. The first clip was a reaction to an issue, but clipping two more without a similar problem could be seen as unnecessary. Then, the coworker was clearly disturbed by the noise and perceived it as gross. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could be rude.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong, but people have different sensitivities. If the office has a policy against certain activities, that's a factor. But since there's no mention of a policy, it's more about social norms. The key points are: was the action disruptive, and how did it affect others?\n\nClipping nails can be noisy, and if it's done in an area where others can hear, it might be considered inconsiderate. The friend did it in her cubicle, so maybe the sound wasn't intended to bother others. However, coworker B was affected, so the friend might be inconsiderate by continuing after being asked not to, even if it's in her own space.\n\nThe debate is between hygiene/personal comfort vs. others' discomfort. The friend's response was dismissive, which could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings. That might tip the scales towards the friend being in the wrong, at least in part. However, some might argue that it's a minor issue to be upset over.\n\nIn AITA posts, the answer often depends on balance. If the friend was reasonable (only clipping the hanging nail) and didn't respond rudely, maybe it's a low issue. But since she clipped more nails after being told and responded with \"chill out,\" that escalates the situation. So the friend might be in the wrong for continuing the action and being dismissive.\n"
