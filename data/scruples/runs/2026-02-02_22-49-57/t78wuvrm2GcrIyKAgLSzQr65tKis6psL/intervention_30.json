And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her. \n\nFirst, the friend initially had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then, after Coworker B confronted her, she clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the sound and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive.\n\nI need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically something people do in open areas, but some might do it in private if needed. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private. However, the sound carrying 100 feet is a factor. Maybe the workplace has specific rules about such things, but the question is about social norms rather than formal policies.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is strong, calling it \"disgusting\" and \"gross.\" Some people might find the sound annoying or off-putting, which is a subjective reaction. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not address the other person's discomfort appropriately. However, the act of clipping nails itself isn't inherently wrong, but the context and reactions matter.\n\nThe key points are: the friend did it in her cubicle (private space), the coworker was overly sensitive to the sound, and the friend's response was dismissive. The debate hinges on whether the action was inconsiderate. Since the friend didn't do it in a shared space and addressed the immediate issue, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the sound was a disturbance, even unintentionally, that could tip the balance. But since the coworker reacted strongly and the friend didn't escalate the situation beyond clipping what she needed, it's possible she's not the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
