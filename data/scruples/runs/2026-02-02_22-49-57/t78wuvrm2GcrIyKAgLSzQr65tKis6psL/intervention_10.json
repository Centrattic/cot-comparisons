And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author, who is a friend in this situation, is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story describes that the friend clipped a hanging nail and then two more to even things out after a coworker complained. The coworker was really upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping a nail that's causing discomfort might be necessary. But doing it in a workplace where others might find it gross could be a problem. The coworker B was clearly upset, even hearing it from 100 feet away. That's a lot. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive.\n\nNow, are there company policies about this? The story doesn't mention any, but if there's a workplace rule against eating or doing personal grooming, that would matter. Since there's no info on that, maybe it's more about social norms.\n\nIn many workplaces, people might avoid doing things like clipping nails because it can be unsanitary or distracting. The fact that the coworker was disturbed by the sound and the act suggests that it's seen as inappropriate there. The friend continued after the complaint, which could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings, even if she thought it was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was handling a personal hygiene issue. But maybe there's a better way to do it, like stepping outside or using a restroom where others can't hear. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive and not acknowledging the coworker's valid discomfort.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the friend might have overstepped by continuing after being asked to stop and not considering the impact on others. Therefore, the answer might be that she is in the wrong.\n"
