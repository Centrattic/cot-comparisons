And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole. So the scenario is that a coworker (Coworker B) overheard the friend talking about a hanging nail and demanded she not clip them at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail, and even did two more to even them out. Coworker B texted her that she could hear it from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross because the sound can be irritating, and there's the potential for splinters or mess. Others see it as a minor, necessary task that people do all the time.\n\nThe friend's actions: she initially mentioned having a hanging nail and had clippers. Then, after Coworker B told her not to do it, she went ahead and clipped not just the one nail but two more. That part might be problematic because even if she had a reason to clip one, doing two more after being asked not to could be seen as defiant or inconsiderate. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, especially if Coworker B was genuinely uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not to clip nails could be seen as being overly sensitive or controlling. The text message about hearing it from 100 feet away adds to that, suggesting maybe Coworker B is more bothered than the situation warrants.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the friend inconsiderate by clipping after being asked not to, and was her response appropriate? Clipping one nail to fix a problem is understandable, but doing two more might be seen as unnecessary, especially if others are bothered by it. The friend's response to \"chill out\" might not address the underlying issue and could escalate tension.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Coworker B overreacted, making the friend the victim. But given that the friend continued the action after being asked to stop, it's possible she contributed to the problem. The line between being assertive with personal needs and being inconsiderate is thin here.\n\nIn many workplaces, there's an unspoken rule about not doing certain personal tasks at your desk, like eating, using phone in meetings, etc. Clipping nails might fall into that category. If the workplace has no specific policy, it's more about sensitivity to others. If others are disturbed, then it's better to do it in a private space or outside the office. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the noise carried. So maybe she should have done it during a lunch break or at home.\n\nSo considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing the action after being asked and for responding dismissively. Alternatively, Coworker B might be overreacting. But since the question is about the author's friend, the answer would hinge on whether her actions after being told to stop were inconsiderate. The act of clipping after being asked not to, even if in her own cubicle, combined with adding two more nails and the dismissive response, might make her the asshole. So the answer would be A.\n"
