And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her, then the friend responding by clipping more nails and getting another complaint. \n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't against the law, but it's about what's considered acceptable in a workplace. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unsanitary, but others see it as a quick fix when needed.\n\nThe coworker overheard the comment, confronted her, and then complained further. The friend clipped a hanging nail first, which is understandable, but then clipped two more. Maybe to even them out, but that could be seen as overdoing it. The coworker heard the sound from 100 feet away, which shows it's loud. \n\nIs it gross? That's subjective. Some might find it gross because of the noise or the mess. But in a cubicle, it's a private space, so maybe it's okay. The friend's response \"chill out\" could be dismissive, which might escalate the situation. \n\nWorkplace rules matter. If the company doesn't prohibit it, the friend isn't breaking any rules. However, if it's causing a disturbance, that's a different story. The key is whether it's affecting others. The coworker was disturbed, so maybe the friend should have been more considerate. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the act is causing a disturbance, then maybe she should avoid it. But if it's a quick fix in her own space, then it's her right. The answer depends on company policy and how much it's affecting others. But since the coworker is getting upset, maybe the friend should have considered that and maybe done it during a break or at home. But the question is if she's the asshole. I lean towards no, because it's a minor act, but the response could be seen as dismissive. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (No), but there's some nuance.\n"
