And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a conflict between the friend and Coworker B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered appropriate workplace behavior. Clipping nails is a personal hygiene task. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess, but others might think it's normal. The key here is whether there were company policies against it. If there are no policies, then maybe it's a matter of company culture or personal preferences.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails after Coworker B told her not to. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be a bit on her. Maybe she overreacted by clipping more after being told not to. But Coworker B was being confrontational and walked into her cubicle to demand she stop, which could be seen as aggressive.\n\nThe friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might be dismissive. But Coworker B was over 100 feet away and still heard her, which could be a valid complaint about the noise. However, the initial act of clipping a hanging nail is probably necessary for the friend's comfort.\n\nSo, the main points: Is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's not illegal, but workplace policies might have rules. If there are no policies, then it's a social norm issue. Coworker B's reaction is strong, but the friend's actions after being told might be questionable. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle it, but that's part of the conflict.\n\nI think the answer is B (No). The friend isn't in the wrong if there's no policy against it. Coworker B's reaction is about personal preference, not a violation. The friend addressed a need and might have over-clipped, but the core action isn't wrong. The workplace should allow some personal grooming unless prohibited.\n"
