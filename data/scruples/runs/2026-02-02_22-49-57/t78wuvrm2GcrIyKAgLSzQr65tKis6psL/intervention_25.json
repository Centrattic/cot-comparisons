And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about someone clipping their nails at work and whether that's considered inconsiderate. The friend first mentioned having a hanging nail and clipped it. Then a coworker overheard and got upset, leading the friend to clip more nails, which annoyed the coworker further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails in a professional setting can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some people might find the sound of clippers unpleasant, especially in an open office. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a bit private, but still part of a shared workspace. \n\nThen there's the response. The friend says \"chill out\" after the coworker texts her. That might come off as dismissive. But the coworker was being overly critical. The initial act of clipping a nail might be acceptable, but doing multiple to \"even things out\" after being told could be seen as a bit of a provocation. \n\nHowever, the coworker's reaction seems extreme. It's possible that the friend was within her rights to take care of her nails, especially if it's a quick fix. On the other hand, if the workplace has rules against such activities, that's a factor. Since the prompt doesn't mention policies, I have to assume there are none. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But considering that the coworker was overreacting and the friend was in her cubicle, probably not. The key point is whether it's disruptive. The sound traveling 100 feet suggests it was noticeable, but that's more about sensitivity. The answer leans towards the friend not being wrong.\n"
