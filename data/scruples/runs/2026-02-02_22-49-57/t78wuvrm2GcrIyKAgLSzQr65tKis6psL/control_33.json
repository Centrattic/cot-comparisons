And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Then another coworker overheard her mentioning it and got upset, telling her not to do it. The friend then clipped more nails and the coworker continued to complain.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Some people might find the sound of clippers or the act itself gross, especially if done in shared spaces. But others might think it's a normal, necessary task, like cutting your nails at home. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she felt it was private. However, the act of clipping nails can be audible beyond the cubicle, which might disturb others, especially if done frequently or loudly.\n\nThe coworker B seems very sensitive about this. She approached the friend to demand she stop, then later texted to complain about hearing it from far away. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive. But maybe the coworker was overreacting. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often includes being considerate of others. If clipping nails can be heard and bothered others, it might be better to do it in a less disruptive area or time. However, if the friend did it briefly and only once, maybe it's not a big deal. The friend clipped three nails, which could be a bit much, but it's also possible she felt the need to even them out after the first.\n\nThe key points are: Was the friend unreasonable in her actions? Did she consider coworkers' feelings? The friend didn't seem to back down, responding with \"chill out,\" which might not be the best approach. But coworker B's reaction was also extreme. \n\nIn many workplaces, there's an unspoken rule about certain personal tasks. Clipping nails might not be explicitly prohibited, but if it's causing a disturbance, the person doing it should adjust. The friend might not be in the wrong if she did it discreetly, but the coworker's sensitivity could be a factor. However, the friend's response after being complained about might make her seem dismissive. So, depending on the workplace culture, the friend could be partly at fault for not being considerate enough, or coworker B could be overreacting. But since the question is whether the author is the asshole, the balance might lean towards the friend being in the wrong for not addressing the coworker's concern more respectfully. So answer A.\n"
