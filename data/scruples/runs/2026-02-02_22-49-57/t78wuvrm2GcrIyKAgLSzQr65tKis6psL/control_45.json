And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who clipped their nails at work is in the wrong. The situation is described where a friend had a friend who clipped her nails after a coworker told her not to. The coworker found it disgusting and could hear her from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic. Some people find it gross because of the sound and potential mess. Others argue it's necessary for hygiene. The key points here are the initial remark by Coworker B, then the friend doing it anyway, even clipping more nails. Then Coworker B texts again, upset about hearing it. The friend's response is dismissive.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? Well, Coworker B asked her not to do it, so continuing might be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. Also, doing it in her cubicle\u2014maybe that's a private space, but the sound travels. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive and not considering the coworker's discomfort. However, some might say that Coworker B is being overly sensitive. But generally, if someone asks you to avoid doing something that affects others, ignoring that request could be considered rude. So, the friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's request, even if the initial act isn't inherently wrong. So answer A.\n"
