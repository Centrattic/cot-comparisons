And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story involves Coworker B being upset about it, calling it disgusting and gross, even hearing it from 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around workplace behavior. Clipping nails at work isn't typically something that's outright forbidden unless there are specific policies. But there's a social aspect here. People might find it unpleasant to hear or see someone clipping nails, especially if it's loud or done in shared spaces. The key points are the context and how it affects others.\n\nThe friend did clip a hanging nail, which is understandable if it's a safety issue or uncomfortable. However, after the initial clipping, she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might be more discretionary. Then, Coworker B sent a text expressing strong disapproval. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. If the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, then technically she's not breaking any rules. However, considering common courtesy and workplace etiquette, doing something that visibly or audibly bothers a colleague could be seen as inconsiderate. Especially if it's a shared space, people often adjust their behavior to accommodate others. Clipping nails might be necessary, but maybe doing it during a break or in a private area would be more considerate.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction seems extreme. The demand to stop and the subsequent text about hearing it from 100 feet away suggests a sensitivity that might not be typical. Still, the author did continue after being asked, which might tip the balance towards being inconsiderate, even if not technically wrong.\n\nThe debate is whether it's a minor issue or a bigger one. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as not taking the coworker's feelings seriously. So, even if she's not violating any rules, the social aspect might make her the asshole. But if there's no policy against it, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the act of continuing after being told to stop could be the issue. So, maybe the answer leans towards A (she's in the wrong) because she continued despite the coworker's discomfort, but others might argue it's not her fault. Hmm. Need to decide between A or B based on these points.\n"
