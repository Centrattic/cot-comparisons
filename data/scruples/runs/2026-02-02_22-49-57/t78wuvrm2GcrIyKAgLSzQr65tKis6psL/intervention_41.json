And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail and used clippers, which her coworker overheard and found disgusting. Then she clipped more nails after the first one, and the coworker sent a text about it. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically something people do in open areas, but maybe in a private space like a cubicle. However, the sound of clippers might be noticeable, especially in an open-plan office. The coworker's reaction is strong, calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend's response was dismissive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend was wrong. On one hand, she fixed a medical issue (hanging nail) which could be painful, so maybe that's reasonable. But doing it in a shared space where noise is an issue could be considered inconsiderate. The coworker's discomfort is valid, even if some people think it's overreacting. The friend then clipped two more nails after the first, which might be seen as unnecessary. The response \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive of the coworker's feelings.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. If she did it in a private area and quickly, it might not be a problem. However, the noise was a big issue here. Depending on the workplace culture, some companies might have policies against certain activities. Also, the friend's actions could be seen as disregarding the coworker's comfort. However, the coworker's reaction seems extreme. It's a bit of a grey area. The friend isn't necessarily in the wrong if it was a quick fix for a medical need, but the timing and location might have been inconsiderate. The key points are whether it's a medical necessity and how considerate she was of others' feelings. Since the coworker was nearby and the noise was a problem, maybe the friend should have used a different location or time. But if there's no strict policy, it's hard to say she's the asshole. So maybe the answer is B (No), but there's a nuance here. The friend isn't entirely wrong, but she could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the coworker overreacted, the friend isn't the asshole. So answer B.\n"
