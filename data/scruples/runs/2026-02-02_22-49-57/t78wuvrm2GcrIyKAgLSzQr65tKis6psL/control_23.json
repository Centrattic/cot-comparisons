And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: She had a hanging nail and mentioned it to a coworker. Then another coworker, B, overheard and told her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend did clip her nail, then two more to even them out. Then coworker B texted her that she could hear from far away and called it gross. The friend replied \"chill out\".\n\nSo, what's the issue here? Well, clipping nails in public or at work can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. But the friend's reasoning was practical\u2014fixing a hanging nail to avoid a splinter or discomfort. However, she took it a step further by clipping two more nails \"to even things out,\" which might have been unnecessary beyond the initial fix.\n\nThe key points to consider are workplace norms and respect for others. Coworker B found the sound and act of clipping nails unpleasant. Even if clipping one nail was a quick fix, doing more might amplify the issue. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not considering coworker B's feelings. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate. If an action affects others, it's good to adjust. Clipping nails in a private area would be more respectful. Since the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe that's acceptable if it's enclosed, but the sound traveling could still be an issue. The main question is whether the act itself is inherently wrong or if the friend overstepped by doing more than necessary and responding dismissively.\n\nSo, balancing the need to fix a personal hygiene issue against the impact on coworkers. The friend isn't the villain for fixing her nail, but doing more and then not acknowledging the coworker's discomfort might tip it. The answer could be that the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe could have been more considerate. However, the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Considering that clipping a necessary nail is understandable, but doing extra and responding dismissively, the answer might be B, but with some nuance. But maybe A because the coworker's discomfort is valid and the friend didn't consider it enough. Hmm.\n"
