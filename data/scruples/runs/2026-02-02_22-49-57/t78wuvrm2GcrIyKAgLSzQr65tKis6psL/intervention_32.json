And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping their nails at work, and another coworker is upset about it. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. That seems reasonable because a broken nail can be uncomfortable or unsightly. But the coworker overheard her mention it and then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to even out the length, which might have been unnecessary or done more for spite than necessity. \n\nCoworker B is clearly disturbed by the sound of nail clipping and found it gross. There's a subjective element here\u2014what one person finds normal, another might find off-putting. In an office setting, there are usually unspoken rules about what's acceptable in terms of personal grooming. Clipping nails might be considered something to do in a restroom or during a break, not in a shared workspace where others can hear it. \n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive. It might not be the best way to handle a colleague's discomfort. Even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong, the way the friend responded could escalate tension. \n\nHowever, the friend was doing something personal but not harmful. There's no indication of negligence or malice. The coworker's reaction is strong, but that doesn't automatically make the friend wrong. It's a matter of workplace etiquette and mutual respect. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The act of clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but it might be considered inappropriate in an office setting. 2) The friend's decision to clip more nails after the confrontation could be seen as a provocation. 3) The response to the coworker's text might have been insensitive. \n\nBalancing these factors, it's a judgment call. Some might say the friend overstepped by continuing after being asked to stop, while others might see it as a minor issue. Since the question is about being the \"asshole,\" it's about who acted inconsiderately. The coworker's strong reaction is extreme, but the friend's actions after the initial clip (clipping more and the dismissive reply) might tip the scales. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because continuing after the coworker's objection and the dismissive response show a lack of consideration, even if the initial act was understandable."
